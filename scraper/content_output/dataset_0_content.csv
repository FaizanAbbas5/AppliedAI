"Central Bank officials warned on Monday that there could be a knock-on effect to the Irish economy in the event of a stock market shock, as valuations of US technology stocks show signs of being “stretched”. A valuation model developed by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller puts stocks in the US S&P 500 index as trading at about 40 times earnings, adjusted for inflation – the second-highest level ever, trailing only the dot-com peak in 2000. Mark Cassidy, director of financial stability at the Central Bank, noted that the 10 largest US companies – including Amazon, Meta, Apple and Nvidia – have accounted for 45 per cent of gains of the wider S&P 500 since April, as the market has surged to all-time highs – despite high levels of macroeconomic uncertainty. Most of the tech groups have major operations and are significant employers in Ireland. Irish business grandee Gary McGann on working with Michael Smurfit, the fall of Anglo Irish and the current state of the Irish economy This week on Inside Business host Ciarán Hancock is joined in studio by Gary McGann, a grandee of Irish business whose many roles included being chief executive of drinks group Gilbeys, Aer Lingus and packaging group Smurfit. Born and raised in Dublin, Gary actually began his career in the civil service, with the Comptroller & Auditor General. He studied at night to become an accountant and later moved into the private sector, rising up the ranks and moving around to eventually become CEO of Smurfit in 2002.He has also had a busy career as a non-executive director, including roles with Anglo Irish Bank at the time of its collapse, and with bakery goods group Arytza, at a challenging time for that business. We covered a lot of ground in this interview. You’ll hear Gary talk about his childhood, his time in school and a couple of false starts in university. We also take a deep dive into his business careers, the highs and the lows. And he gives Ciarán his perspective on the current state of the Irish economy, and what we could be doing better. Along with some tips for young business leaders starting out in their careers. Produced by John Casey with JJ Vernon on sound. However, Cassidy said at the launch of the authority’s second financial stability review of the year that the domestic Irish economy faces greater direct exposure to international tariffs on trade. READ MORE “Both would impact directly upon Ireland. But it is a trade and FDI (foreign direct investment) shock, anything further in relation to tariffs, [that] would affect us most directly here,” Mr Cassidy said. “We are somewhat less exposed directly to financial market shocks, but inevitably they would also spill over.” The pricing of artificial intelligence-related (AI) stocks is reliant on ongoing favourable projections for earnings growth, the report said. A substantial shift in investor risk appetite, major negative developments in the business models of AI-related companies, or a series of correlated macroeconomic or financial shocks could lead to a significant market correction, it warned. The International Monetary Fund, Bank of England, and members of the European Central Bank governing council have warned in the past month about market valuation risks, while the heads of Wall Street beasts Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have predicted that equities could fall 10-20 per cent. The Central Bank report also warned that market interest rates attached to corporate bonds are also at multiyear lows, relative to low-risk sovereign bonds, and “appear disconnected from the uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment”. It noted that the bankruptcies in recent months of US car-loan specialist Tricolor Holdings and car-parts supplier First Brands Group are “warning signs” have led to heightened concerns over lending standards in the international private credit market. When asked about the potential impact on the European economy from US tariffs, Central Bank governor Gabriel Makhlouf indicated that he was more concerned about tariffs and trade barriers on the EU single market. A landmark report on EU competitiveness last year, written by former ECB president Mario Draghi, found that Europe’s existing internal barriers act as a de facto 44 per cent tariff on average goods and a 100 per cent tariff for services. “We should be spending less time worrying about tariffs from the United States and thinking more about the tariffs that are effectively imposed within the single market,” Mr Makhlouf said, adding that more time should be spent trying to dismantle the internal EU obstacles.",left
"Late in a player’s career, there comes a game that sharpens the focus like no other, where you exist in a bubble of “now”. For me, that moment arrived in November, 2013, while preparing to face New Zealand. I was running out of road. At 33, World Cup selection was far from guaranteed and Ireland were unlikely to cross paths with the All Blacks again unless we reached the final. It sharpened me in a way youth never could. Throughout my career, I had moments, largely outside of my control, that provided perspective and acted as a catalyst. I wrote recently about the power of feedback and mental resilience, which is something every young player should embrace. However, when your physical mortality as a player appears on the horizon, smart players recognise it and allow it to set them free, while the rest waste years worrying about the end. So, when I was handed media duty the week of the All Blacks Test, the normal polite nods and soft edges were gone. READ MORE I was clipped, focused and unwilling to waste time entertaining questions that did not matter. I was present in a way you only become when you know a window is closing. Mindset, when attuned to a task correctly, can be a very powerful driver for a player. Joe Schmidt was beginning to look for alternatives in the centre and had a young Robbie Henshaw on the bench. Luke Marshall was also emerging and had started against Australia. There was no future to protect – only the present, whatever that would entail. It can be empowering for those that embrace the challenge. Some do not, trying to deny time and cling to the idea that nothing has changed. Rugby drifts away from them before they realise what has slipped. I couldn’t help but think of that feeling as I watched Stuart McCloskey last weekend. McCloskey has lived his Test career in the shadow of three outstanding centres. Another time and place and he’d have accumulated 50 caps. Sometimes a player’s ceiling rests at provincial level, where club form never translates to the Test arena. On other occasions, access to the international pathway is blocked by high-grade talent. Are Ireland sliding down rugby's global pecking order? Every time McCloskey has been called upon, he has done well. However, I’ve always felt there was more needed from him at this level to displace the competition. This time felt different. He was selected on merit, plain and simple, even with a pride of Lions from which Farrell had to choose. The 33-year-old played with a hint of that late-career honesty and an edge, both physically and mentally. He had that willingness to carry, to take contact for the team, looking to free others with an offload. It looked like acceptance – and acceptance can be liberating. An untimely groin injury means he won’t play against Japan, but if he stays fit and maintains that abrasiveness, it will be hard to push him aside on his return. He gives Ireland something they need: a directness, a selflessness with an offloading threat that can provide a point of difference. This could yet be the richest chapter of his career. Ireland struggled to break down New Zealand. On the face of it, they were on par in possession and territory, but the All Blacks led the field in metres carried, post-contact carries and line breaks. The game is now asking players and teams for a little bit more imagination with the ball in hand and we didn’t find enough of it in attack. It wasn’t a collapse per se, but Ireland operate off thin margins to be successful, where the collective effort is supplemented by moments of individual brilliance: a Tadhg Beirne turnover, a masterclass from Jamison Gibson-Park, or a Dan Sheehan try, all built on a strong team platform. When we don’t have those individual high points, or the team basics are out of whack, the limitations within the Irish system are laid bare. Ireland went with a clear plan of how to win, a little rigid in approach perhaps, but for three quarters of the game it sufficed to give them a winning position, even managing to absorb Beirne’s red card. However, there was a tariff to play for a misfiring lineout, some poor punting and no line breaks. The crowd sensed it. Kicks that once felt like clever pressure began to feel like the surrendering of opportunity. With players like James Lowe, Jamie Osborne and McCloskey in the backline, you want to see moments where the ball is kept in hand and defenders are forced to make decisions. New Zealand may have built their game around structure for the last few years, but the current group are rediscovering that attacking instinct. The individual threats with ball in hand were clear. Leicester Fainga’anuku made a huge impact from the bench, responsible for the break that led to the Ardie Savea try. Beauden Barrett drew Garry Ringrose, his pass beautifully timed to open a gap for Damian McKenzie. New Zealand’s creativity and support play sliced and diced Ireland in that final quarter. There is a lesson there for Andy Farrell’s squad: find new faces to be creative or adopt a more adventurous approach from the collective. It has to be nuanced – not flinging passes for the sake of it, but moving the ball from the point of contact, everyone thinking about space and actively looking for it. Too often, Ireland were narrow in orientation. Even so, it’s far from gloom and doom. As my buddy Felipe Contepomi, head coach of Argentina, says: “If the decision is right, then we can work on the execution.” Think Crowley’s cross-kick, for example. The Japan match is an opportunity to respond to the naysayers. Eddie Jones will try to flood the defensive line and force Ireland to kick. The visitors will be a team with a plan. The Australian has caused Ireland problems in the past. McCloskey’s display against the All Blacks can inspire. He was selected on form and delivered. It puts everyone on notice and gives Farrell further latitude to trust his instincts when it comes to selection, albeit slightly limited by injury and also the Ireland XV match against Spain in Madrid. Tom Farrell might get a run against Japan. He’s earned a chance and it’s a reward for form. If not now, when? He could be the attacking catalyst for those around him. There needs to be a sense of adventure that translates from selection to the pitch. It’s time to back form over reputation.",left
"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said “no” when asked whether the U.S. was at risk of entering a recession in 2026, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” he’s confident Americans will feel economic relief next year stemming from President Donald Trump’s tariff agenda and trade deals. “I am very, very optimistic on 2026. We have set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy,” Bessent told moderator Kristen Welker. He also said, “We believe health care is going to come down,” adding that the Trump administration would have news on that front this week. The treasury secretary acknowledged that there is some pressure on the economy in certain sectors like housing, responding to comments from National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett earlier this month that “we’re starting to see pockets of the economy that look like they might be in a recession.” “Clearly, housing has been struggling, and interest rate-sensitive sectors have been in a recession,” Bessent said Sunday. He added that the recent government shutdown, which was the longest in history, also squeezed the economy. An NBC News poll earlier this month found that about two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living. Still, the treasury secretary pointed to the GOP’s landmark domestic policy package that Trump signed into law over the summer — the president’s “big, beautiful bill” — and to the Trump’s tariff and trade agenda as signs that 2026 will yield a stronger economy for Americans. “I am very confident about 2026, because what we are going to see is the president has done peace deals, tax deals and trade deals [and] the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill,’” Bessent said, adding that the various components of that legislation are “all kicking in.” In a separate interview on Fox, Hassett also predicted that ""it’s going to be an absolute blockbuster year ahead."" ""The good news for the next year is that the factories are going to be in place, and then people are going to start getting the jobs next to the machines and everything else. And so it really, really is a very, very promising set of data,"" he added. Also Sunday, the treasury secretary published an opinion piece in The Washington Post calling for an end to the Senate filibuster. “It’s time for Republicans to acknowledge that the filibuster no longer serves the country — and to be prepared to end it,” he wrote in the piece, later telling Welker that it was meant “to put the Senate on notice.” “The Democrats haven’t been able to stop President Trump in the courts. They haven’t been able to stop him in the media, so they had to harm the American people — 1.5% hit to GDP,” Bessent said, referencing the recent shutdown. “They don’t care. So I believe that Senate Democrats — if Senate Democrats close the government again, that Senate Republicans should immediately abrogate the filibuster.” Bessent also blasted several Democratic lawmakers who are former military and intelligence officers after they released a video telling current military and intelligence officers that they “must refuse” any illegal orders given by the Trump administration. “What I am confident of is that this was a display of gross, gross negligence,” he said, not answering a question about whether the Trump administration is issuing illegal orders. He added, “There is one commander in chief, and when you step outside of the chain of command and try to create the noise and chaos, that only helps our enemies.” He also spoke about the ongoing peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, voicing support for a 28-point peace deal backed by the U.S. that has drawn concern from Ukrainians, European leaders and a bipartisan group of senators who say the peace proposal favors Russia. “At the end of the day, it’s going to be a decision with the Ukrainians. President Trump is a president of peace,” Bessent said before blasting European leaders who are planning more sanctions on Russia. “The Europeans tell me, ‘Oh, we are doing our 19th sanctions package.’ In my mind ... if you’re going to do something 19 times, you failed,” the treasury secretary said, instead praising Trump’s economic sanctions package on India, which targeted Russian oil. He added that he has not spoken to the president about an alleged timeline for negotiating this peace proposal, including whether Trump is pushing for the deal to be signed by Thanksgiving.",left
"On Wednesday, a rumor began popping up in Washington about a momentous policy change: the White House, it was said, would issue an executive order on Friday that would finally preempt state AI laws, handing over those regulatory powers to the federal government. The minute it leaked online, lawyers and policymakers began to scour every sentence of it. There was a lot about it that seemed politically unfeasible; there was even more that seemed overbroad, possibly illegal. There were a lot of agencies that had suddenly been cut out. David Sacks tried to kill state AI laws — and it blew up in his face A leaked executive order draft reveals the tech billionaire making a power play to become America’s AI policy gatekeeper. A leaked executive order draft reveals the tech billionaire making a power play to become America’s AI policy gatekeeper. But crucially, they noticed how much power would have been handed to a certain South African tech-billionaire-turned-special-government-employee who’d tunneled his way into the West Wing — not Elon Musk, but the other one. In every section of the draft order, President Donald Trump was directing his cabinet secretaries and agency heads to imminently issue reports and guidance on how to punish states with AI laws, within the next 90 days. In the Attorney General’s case, they had 30 days to establish an entire legal task force to sue those states. Every single one of them would have to consult David Sacks, the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto — and one of the most influential tech venture capitalists in the world — while executing the order. “I don’t want to say it was a power grab. That’s too strong of a term,” said a tech policy adviser close to the White House. “But it’s definitely a consolidation, as it were, of his power.” The MAGA universe immediately exploded, with War Room host Steve Bannon — who’d managed to help kill a previous attempt at an AI moratorium in the Senate this year — dedicating part of his Friday show to the draft order. In Congress, Democrats revolted publicly; tech-skeptical Republicans were quietly preparing their statements. The AI policy world immediately issued reports illustrating how much power would have been sucked into the hands of the White House. The order had been scheduled to be signed on Friday — and then it never was. Outside the White House, the AI executive order, had it been signed, would have been legally unenforceable. But inside the White House, it would have been treated as an imperial mandate. Trump’s executive orders are historically designed to force his underlings to get his will done immediately, legality be damned, and the fallout tends to be irreversible by the time that the courts find his actions illegal. His tariff order, for instance, may soon be overturned by the Supreme Court, but not before causing trillions in economic losses and damaging the US’s international relationships. Asked for comment, the White House press office email run by Karoline Leavitt refused to comment on the record, instead only insistently asking us to name our sources. And from there, it would have been used as a threat against the states. “I suspect that if it’s effective, the most effective part of it will be having a chilling effect on state legislation,” Charlie Bullock, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Law and AI, told The Verge. One section of the draft would have allowed the government to pull any federal funding from states in violation of the order — not just rural broadband grants, which had been used as leverage in previous preemption fights, but anything from highway funds to education grants. “Even if [a state] can win a court case to make them give them that funding eventually, it would take a long time. States might be convinced by that.” As such, it would have turned Sacks into the US’s AI policy gatekeeper in one fell swoop. Though there are several White House officials with ties to the tech industry, Sacks, who has a provisional government employment status, is seen by Washington insiders as Trump’s closest conduit with the big-name tech CEOs, who consider him as a peer. (Though Vice President JD Vance did work in Silicon Valley prior to politics, he never did break into the three-comma club.) “He’s trying to maintain America’s competitive edge in the big picture, and you could say, in a more selfish manner, he’s trying to protect the tech industry [with] a more parochial, These are my people approach,” said the tech policy adviser close to the White House. But Sacks was also trying to neutralize a third, internal threat: the political forces within the executive branch, both on the progressive left and hard MAGA right, that were hell-bent on curbing his influence. Even in this hyperpartisan climate, the left and right share a common cause in regulating the excesses of Big Tech, and will even publicly join forces to oppose them. And it apparently takes place behind the scenes, too. As the tech policy adviser described it, the informal internal anti-Sacks alliance consisted of holdovers from the Democratic Biden administration “that were hyper-regulating and wanting to break up tech companies,” and the hard-right MAGA officials in his current administration “who don’t trust tech, and similarly want to regulate technology companies — either on the state level or on the federal level — and kneecap them.” According to those analyzing the bill, it was telling which entities had been completely shut out. The first move, spotted by tech policy experts, was identifying who’d been cut out. In 2023, President Joe Biden’s massive AI executive order empowered a broad swath of agencies to develop AI policy, and most — if not all of them — were suddenly absent. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), for instance, had been delegated to research AI risk management, evaluation, and standards development. (Those concerns, incidentally, were recently encoded in California’s AI safety law — a law that the AI industry has strenuously opposed.) Also missing: any mention of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), which centralizes the administration’s tech policies into one place before being brought to the President; the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the DHS agency that focuses on national security internet threats; or the Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI), the name of which speaks for itself. “Maybe in practice, David Sacks will be consulting them and the [Office of Legislative Affairs] might be communicating with them,” said Riki Parikh, the policy director for the bipartisan Alliance for Secure AI and a former lawyer for the Biden administration. “But it’s surprising to not list them out.” Instead, the proposed moratorium would have been carried out by four agencies: the Department of Justice, which would have sued the states in violation of the order; the Department of Commerce, which would analyze which states could lose their broadband funding; the Federal Trade Commission, which would have investigated which states would be engaged in “deceptive conduct” over ideological bias; and the Federal Communications Commission, which would have developed a federal AI reporting standard. All, naturally, would be advised by Sacks — and all of them now had power to pursue ways to punish states that wrote or enforced AI laws. Populist Republicans, particularly those in the MAGA base, immediately saw how much Sacks had influence throughout the entire order, and how much the order would threaten any state. Though they had briefly aligned with the tech right in getting Trump elected, Republicans increasingly turned on their allies over a complete ideological mismatch: they believe AI is a threat to conservative family values and will steal American jobs, are allergic to federal incursion into states’ sovereignty, and hold a general disdain for how quickly tech CEOs went from supporting Democrats to Trump. Several red states have begun writing their own AI regulations, and governors like Florida’s Ron DeSantis and Arkansas’ Sarah Huckabee Sanders have openly voiced their dissent against a moratorium. Even Trump’s open support of a moratorium hasn’t swayed the base. “Purely just from a political strategy standpoint, the base of the Republican Party is not with David Sacks and [fellow VC and Trump supporter] Marc Andreessen on this. They’re just not,” said Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime Republican strategist and the CEO for the bipartisan Alliance for Secure AI. ”And I don’t think they care because they’re just like, It doesn’t matter to us. We’re here to get what we want and there’s three years remaining in this administration. We were Harris and Biden and Hillary supporters, and then we became Trump supporters because it’s convenient.” Little did the AI world anticipate that MAGA would immediately try to kneecap them, even joining forces with the progressive anti-tech factions in government, and that their aggressive Silicon Valley approach via executive order would have further widened the rift. But it was enough for them to back off temporarily. The following week, a new rumor circulated Washington that the administration would sign an AI-related order, and they did — but for a completely different, non-preemption, very uncontroversial project directing the National Labs to engage more with AI development. The Special Advisor on AI and Crypto was mentioned only once. Update, November 25th: Added comment from the White House press office.",left
"What will happen to home prices in 2026? Here's what experts say buyers should know now. Homebuyers finally got some good news late this year when mortgage rates dropped considerably following the Federal Reserve's back-to-back rate cuts in September and October. With the Fed easing its stance on rates, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell into the low-6% range, a notable improvement from the 7%-plus rates homebuyers faced earlier this year. These lower borrowing costs are helping to reignite interest in the housing market, but the big question now is what happens next. Will improved affordability bring more buyers into the market and push home values higher? Could rising inventory finally give buyers the upper hand? Or will economic uncertainty keep things flat? As 2026 approaches, the direction of home prices is also up in the air, so we spoke with mortgage and real estate professionals to get their predictions about where home prices could head next year. Here's what they had to say. Find out how affordable the right mortgage loan options could be now. What will happen to home prices in 2026? Here's what experts say buyers should know now Steven Glick, director of mortgage sales at Ziffy, an all-in-one AI-powered real estate investment platform, expects flat to mildly positive home appreciation at somewhere between 0.5% and 2%. ""That band reflects two things moving in opposite directions: Rates have eased enough to coax demand back, but affordability is still stretched and supply is slowly rebuilding,"" Glick says. This outlook signals a return to normalcy after years of extremes, according to Debbie Calixto, sales manager at mortgage lender loanDepot. ""We expect moderate price growth in 2026 — likely below 4% on average across the country,"" Calixto says. Karen Mayfield, national head of originations at mortgage-as-a-benefit provider Multiply Mortgage, sees a similar pattern unfolding as lower rates bring buyers and sellers back into the market. However, Mayfield predicts pent-up demand will absorb new home supply. Learn more about the lowest mortgage rates you could qualify for in this market. What could happen in 2026 to cause home prices to rise? Several conditions could push home prices higher in 2026, experts say. Here's what could cause home prices to rise next year: - Mortgage rates drift below 6% and stay there. ""Each quarter-point matters for monthly payments and buyer qualifying power,"" says Glick. ""With the Fed already easing and signaling more to come, a gentle slide in mortgage rates would firm demand."" - The labor market holds steady. ""If employment is stable, more people will come off the fence and buy,"" says Joe Chung, a realtor with Coldwell Banker. When demand improves, prices tend to climb. - Construction costs rise. ""Tariff-driven cost increases will push new home prices higher, creating a floor for existing home values,"" Mayfield says. What could happen in 2026 to cause home prices to fall? On the flip side, experts say a few factors, including the following, could push home prices down next year: - Mortgage rates climb back up. ""An inflation surprise or wider risk premiums would lift the 10-year Treasury and, by extension, 30-year mortgages,"" Glick says. As affordability worsens, fewer buyers can qualify, weakening demand and putting downward pressure on prices. - Housing supply surges unexpectedly. According to Mayfield, a wave of baby boomers downsizing (meaning there are more homesellers) could flood the market with inventory faster than buyers can absorb it. - The economy weakens. Rising unemployment or a broader economic downturn would reduce buyer demand and purchasing power. Chung cautions that the market remains fragile. ""Small shifts tend to 'freak out' confidence, which can soften values nationally,"" Chung says. What could happen in 2026 to cause home prices to stay the same? The most probable path forward requires the following conditions to hold: - Mortgage rates and inventory move in tandem. Glick describes this as a ""push-pull balance,"" where improved affordability adds demand while growing supply adds choice, netting to flat-ish national prices. - Economic conditions stay predictable. Mayfield emphasizes the importance of stability. ""The key is absence of shocks — no rate spikes, no inventory floods and no major policy changes that dramatically alter buyer or seller behavior,"" Mayfield says. - Regional differences average out. Some Sun Belt and pandemic-boom metros continue digesting their 2021 to 2022 price surges. Meanwhile, supply-constrained Northeastern and Midwestern markets hold firm. ""Nationally, that averages out near zero to low-single-digit gains,"" Glick says. The bottom line Experts largely expect home prices to stay stable with modest growth in 2026, but that doesn't mean you should wait to buy. Glick advises locking in if the home and payment work today. ""Rates are already lower than they were earlier in 2025,"" Glick says. ""There's no guarantee 2026 gives you meaningfully lower rates, and even a small price rise or more bidding can offset a minor rate dip."" Calixto agrees, warning that new economic data or Fed policy changes can shift mortgage interest rates quickly. So if the numbers work for you now, it may be wise to move forward. Connect with a real estate agent who knows your target area and speak with several lenders to explore your options. They'll help you understand local market conditions and find a loan structure that fits your goals and timeline.",left
"Associated British Foods (ABF), the food and retail conglomerate the group that owns Penneys and Primark, is exploring a spin-off of its fashion chain and food business as part of a strategic review. The UK-listed group on Tuesday said it was reviewing ownership of both businesses in consultation with its majority shareholder, Wittington Investments, the holding company for the Weston family that has food and retail businesses in North America and Europe. ABF said it was committed to “maintaining majority ownership of both businesses”. Shares in the group, which has a market capitalisation of £16.3 billion (€18.5 billion), were down 2.6 per cent in early trading in London. George Weston, chief executive and third generation of the family shareholders, told the Financial Times that “the financial markets will better understand the food business if Primark were separated into a standalone listed business”. READ MORE “There’s a realistic chance of this happening,” he said. ABF has faced persistent scrutiny over the past decade about whether Primark — which sells T-shirts for £2.50 (€2.84) and jeans for £14 — fits into a portfolio that includes bioethanol, sugar beets, bread, Twinings tea and Tilda rice. [ Penneys owner Primark marks Middle East entry with Kuwait storeOpens in new window ] The company has historically argued that being a family-owned conglomerate helped insulate it from downturns and allowed it to plan for the long term. While Primark has been ABF’s standout business for a number of years, it has struggled in recent years as cash-strapped shoppers rein in spending. The rapid emergence of Shein and Temu, which ship cheap clothes directly from Chinese factories to consumers’ homes, has added to the chain’s challenges. Independent analyst Nick Bubb said “it would be ironic if after all these years ABF decides to separate off Primark just as its performance starts to be badly impacted” by competition from Shein and Temu. Tom O’Brien of Nephin Energy on the importance of gas, the potential of biomethane, and whether our energy bills will come down Mr Weston said any potential split of Primark from the business was “not in response to any trading issues”, adding that the question of Primark’s role within ABF had been regularly reviewed and last considered before the pandemic hit five years ago. The current strategic review had been going on for a “number of weeks”, Weston said, but stressed that a split was “not a done deal” and could take up to two years to complete. ABF’s food business spans groceries, ingredients and agricultural products, and Weston signalled he intended to continue as its head. Examining a split was about effective governance, rather than a need to change strategy, said Weston, adding that “it’s not about the short-term, it’s about the next 20 years”. Several analysts described ABF’s move as “surprise”. “The food businesses are not very well understood as the focus has always been on Primark, and Primark trades on a significant implied discount to other listed fashion retail peers,” said Anubhav Malhotra, an analyst at Panmure Liberum. “The separation of the businesses could help unlock some of this value.” ABF reported on Tuesday that Primark’s full-year revenues rose by 1 per cent to £9.5 billion and operating profits increased by 2 per cent to £1.12 billion. The chain has been steadily expanding in the US over a number of years and now has 33 stores in the country. At a group level, ABF reported a 1 per cent decline in revenues to £19.5 billion. Operating profit fell 23 per cent to £1.5 billion. Earlier this year, speculation about a Primark spin-off intensified after the abrupt departure of the fashion retailer’s long-serving chief executive Paul Marchant in the wake of a misconduct scandal in March. Primark is being run on an interim basis by former Marks and Spencer executive Eoin Tonge, who joined ABF as chief financial officer in 2022. Weston said the appointment of Marchant’s replacement would be influenced by whether ABF decided to split Primark from the group. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025",left
"Toymaker takes tariff fight to Supreme Court: ""I definitely want my money back"" Toymaker Rick Woldenberg made it his mission to challenge President Trump after he imposed sweeping tariffs earlier this year. Now, his fight has landed in the Supreme Court. Maurice DuBois reports.",left
"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs appear to be on shaky legal ground, with Supreme Court justices on Wednesday indicating he may not have the authority to impose them under a law designed for use during a national emergency. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority that has regularly backed Trump on various contentious cases since he took office in January, but based on the almost three-hour oral argument, the tariffs dispute could go the other way. Both conservative and liberal justices asked tough questions of Trump's lawyer, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, though some of the conservatives seemed more sympathetic to his arguments. The consequences are huge for Trump and the economy at large, with Americans increasingly anxious amid signs that the tariffs are contributing to, rather than alleviating, higher costs. A new NBC News poll found that 63% of registered voters believe Trump is failing to live up to expectations on the economy, after he ran on lowering prices, in part, through tariffs. Other recent polls show a majority of Americans oppose the tariffs, which disproportionately burden small businesses. The legal question is whether a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which allows the president to regulate imports when there is an emergency, extends to the power to impose global tariffs of unspecified duration and breadth. The Constitution states that the power to set tariffs is assigned to Congress. IEEPA, which does not specifically mention tariffs, says the president can ""regulate"" imports and exports when he deems there to be an emergency, which occurs when there is an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" to the nation. Until Trump began his second term in January, no president had ever used the law to tariff imports. Lower courts ruled against the Trump administration, with both sides asking the Supreme Court to issue a definitive ruling. During the argument, Chief Justice John Roberts, one of the court's conservatives, noted that “the imposition of taxes on Americans” has always “been the core power of Congress,"" a fact that was echoed by other justices in their questioning. “The statute doesn’t use the word tariff,” Roberts said. Or as liberal Justice Elena Kagan told Sauer: ""It has a lot of actions that can be taken under this statute. It just doesn't have the one you want."" The high-stakes case puts the spotlight on a court that was skeptical of President Joe Biden’s unilateral use of executive power, including his attempt to forgive billions of dollars in student loan debt. The court blocked that proposal, citing what has been called the “major questions doctrine.” Under that theory, embraced by the conservative majority in recent years, a president cannot impose a broad policy with huge impacts on society and the economy unless Congress passes a law that specifically allows for it. Several justices asked questions suggesting the case could be decided along similar lines. ""It seems it might be directly applicable,"" Roberts said, referring to the doctrine. Justice Neil Gorsuch, another conservative, probed whether it was unconstitutional for Congress to give the president sweeping powers over tariffs, as the government suggested. If the court were to rule for Trump, would there be any limit to Congress ""just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce, or for that matter, declare war?"" he asked Sauer. Gorsuch, appearing to reference efforts by Biden to tackle climate change, also wondered if a president could use the law to impose sweeping tariffs on gas-powered cars and other products that emit greenhouse gases. Sauer conceded that it is “very likely” a president could do that under his argument, adding that the current administration would never do such a thing based on Trump's view that climate change is a ""hoax."" Kagan and the court's two other liberals all pushed back on Sauer's arguments. ""You want to say tariffs are not taxes, but that's exactly what they are. They are generating money from American citizens,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said that when Congress enacted the IEEPA it was ""pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers,"" not expand them. Some of the other conservative justices were more sympathetic to Sauer's arguments, with both Justice Amy Coney Barrett and Justice Brett Kavanaugh questioning why IEEPA would allow for broad trade embargoes on other countries but not the less drastic option of tariffs. The law is intended to address an emergency, but if tariffs are not included, ""you're taking away the president's suite of tools,"" Kavanaugh said. Likewise, Barrett said that it would make sense for Congress to authorize ""weaker medicine than completely shutting down trade."" In questioning lawyers for the challengers, Roberts gave a crumb of hope to Trump by noting that while tariffs are a tax that is a core power of Congress to impose, they also relate to foreign policy, which the president has full authority over. Referencing the impact the tariffs have had in helping Trump make deals with other countries, Roberts said they are ""quite effective in achieving a particular objective."" Trump has made clear how important this case is to him and his economic plan, repeatedly warning of drastic consequences if the court strikes down his tariffs. He had even suggested he would go in person to Wednesday's oral arguments, becoming the first president to do so. He later backed off that idea, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick were both present. “If a President was not able to quickly and nimbly use the power of Tariffs, we would be defenseless, leading perhaps even to the ruination of our Nation,” Trump said in a characteristic Truth Social post Sunday. But even if he were to lose at the Supreme Court, Trump has levied other tariffs under different laws that would survive. And his administration has been looking at other ways of imposing tariffs, although those methods are more limited. The court is hearing the case on an expedited basis, meaning a ruling could be issued in short order. It has consolidated two underlying challenges brought by small businesses and a coalition of states. V.O.S. Selections Inc., a wine and spirits importer, Plastic Services and Products, a pipe and fittings company, and two companies that sell educational toys are among the businesses that sued. The challengers said in court papers that the justices do not even need to reach the ""major questions"" question, noting that the text of IEEPA does not grant any power to impose tariffs. They pointed out that other laws, including the Trade Act, specifically grant the president the authority to levy tariffs in some form. Even if Trump could, in theory, use IEEPA for tariffs, there is no emergency that would warrant invoking it now, they added. The cases concern two sets of tariffs. One is country-by-country or “reciprocal” tariffs, which range from 34% for China to a 10% baseline for the rest of the world. The other is a 25% tariff Trump imposed on some goods from Canada, China and Mexico for what the administration said was their failure to curb the flow of fentanyl. Other tariffs implemented using different legal authorities, such as 50% steel and aluminum tariffs on all other worldwide trading partners, are not at issue in the case before the court. As of the end of August, IEEPA tariffs had raised about $89 billion, according to the latest data available from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If the Supreme Court overturns those tariffs, the government would then face demands from businesses that it pay back that revenue.",left
"UK and US agree zero-tariff deal on pharmaceuticals Officials say the U.K. has sealed a deal securing a 0% tariff rate for all U.K. medicines exported to the U.S. for at least 3 years, in return for the U.K. spending more on new medicines LONDON -- The U.K. has sealed a deal securing a 0% tariff rate for all U.K. medicines exported to the U.S. for at least 3 years, officials said Monday, in return for the U.K. spending more on new medicines. Under the deal, announced by officials on both sides, the United States government agreed to exempt U.K.-origin pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical ingredients, and medical technology from import taxes. The Trump administration said that in return, U.K. drugs firms committed to invest more in the U.S. and create more jobs. As part of the deal, the U.K. government said it will invest around 25% more in new and effective treatments — the first major increase in such spending in over two decades. Both sides hailed the deal as a win. “This vital deal will ensure U.K. patients get the cutting-edge medicines they need sooner, and our world-leading UK firms keep developing the treatments that can change lives,” Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said. U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement “strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to U.S.–U.K. pharmaceutical trade.” Earlier this year President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer agreed on a framework for a trade pact that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products, including beef and ethanol.",left

"In today’s newsletter: An end to the shutdown could be in sight after senators clear a key vote for a deal. An Arctic blast leaves more than 105 million Americans under winter weather bulletins. And the Chargers dominated on “Sunday Night Football.” Here’s what to know today. Senators advance tentative deal to end the government shutdown Senators struck an agreement last night, projecting confidence that it will be sufficient to end the lengthy U.S. government shutdown, three sources with direct knowledge of the details told NBC News. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. The agreement, reached by a group of Democrats who teamed up with Republicans, cleared the first hurdle on a vote of 60-40 to advance in a late-night Senate vote. If it’s approved, it would then need to pass the House and gain President Donald Trump’s signature to become law and reopen the government. Even if it has enough support to clear those hurdles, the process is expected to take days. The deal funds the government through Jan. 30, would fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and reverses attempted layoffs of federal workers. But in a major concession from Democrats, it does not include an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Meanwhile, a group of Senate Democrats is pushing for an investigation into the Trump administration’s use of federal agency websites and emails to post partisan messages blaming Democrats and the “radical left” for the shutdown. In a letter obtained by NBC News, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others ask the Government Accountability Office to open a probe into whether the political messages violated federal laws that pertain to ethics and partisan political activity. More shutdown news: - In a reversal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said that states that issued full November SNAP benefits to recipients following a lower court decision should “immediately undo” the distributions and that failure to comply could result in the cancellation of future federal funds. - Thousands of flights were delayed and canceled over the weekend, as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that many will not be able to spend Thanksgiving with their families. - Trump floated directly paying Americans for their health care costs and giving out $2,000 dividends from tariff revenue, ideas that administration officials later said were not formal proposals being sent to the Senate. Arctic blast to bring frigid temperatures to most of the U.S. An Arctic blast dumping snow on the Midwest is expected to eventually cover two-thirds of the nation and bring record cold to the South. The blast broke off from the polar vortex above Canada, sending the cold air south. A list of National Weather Service bulletins shows more than 105 million people are the subject of advisories, watches and warnings on freezing conditions, winter weather and lake effect snow. The cold sweep is forecast to spread across the eastern two-thirds of the nation, and it could bring freezing temperatures to much of the South by Tuesday while setting low temperature records, the weather service said in last night’s national forecast discussion. Afternoon highs in parts of the South were expected to be 10 to 25 degrees below normal. Chargers defeat Steelers 25-10 on 'Sunday Night Football' As AFC teams continue to make their cases for championship contention, the “Sunday Night Football” spotlight fell on the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Los Angeles Chargers. A 25-10 Chargers victory has kept them in the conversation. Meanwhile, questions remain about the Steelers’ offense, and their own readiness to compete with the conference’s best teams. An expected quarterback duel didn’t materialize: Los Angeles quarterback Justin Herbert threw for 220 yards and a score while Pittsburgh’s Aaron Rodgers struggled. The future Hall of Famer had just 161 yards passing with a touchdown and two interceptions. Chargers wideout Keenan Allen hit a new record, passing Hall of Fame tight end Antonio Gates for the most receptions in franchise history, with 956. The Chargers move to 7-3 while the Steelers drop to 5-4. We covered all the action here.

"Ireland’s economy is like a dog simultaneously barking and wagging its tail. The question is which end to believe. While the European Commission is forecasting the economy here will record “exceptional” growth of close to 11 per cent this year, the Central Bank is warning about the country’s unique exposure to a slowdown in global trade on the back of US tariffs. In its latest financial stability review, the regulator also warns about the possible spillover effects on Ireland if the US AI bubble bursts. Economic forecasts here, no matter how positive, always come with caveats, potential banana skins. Being a small, open economy has its occupational hazards. READ MORE This time the leprechaun in the national accounts is exports. They surged between January and May this year as pharmaceutival multinationals front-loaded exports into the US ahead of Donald Trump’s tariff announcement in April. [ Irish economy forecast to grow at eight times euro area averageOpens in new window ] Most of it related to exports by pharma giant Eli Lilly. The company produces the ingredients for its two blockbuster weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound in Ireland. Either way, this has created a bulge in our headline gross domestic product (GDP) metrics. The commission expects Irish GDP to expand by 10.7 per cent this year, eight times the growth it is forecasting for the euro zone as a whole. Irish business grandee Gary McGann on working with Michael Smurfit, the fall of Anglo Irish and the current state of the Irish economy But GDP has become progressively detached from the real economy here because of the tax planning activities of multinationals which use intellectual property assets to declare as much profit as they can in the State. According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ireland’s headline GDP was €562.8 billion last year, nearly 43 per cent bigger than the agency’s measure of modified measure of gross national income (GNI*) which was €321.1 billion. In other words, GDP overstates the size of the Irish economy by about 40 per cent. That 40 per cent disparity is why the real feel in the Irish economy differs so strikingly from the headline growth metrics that surround it. Throw in an aggravated housing crisis and a dysfunctional health service and Ireland’s turbo-charged economic performance can seem illusory. The Economist magazine left Ireland out of its recent country “rich list” – a league table of how GDP levels in different countries compare - because it claimed Ireland’s data was “polluted by tax arbitrage”. In its report, the European Commission notes that as the front-loading effect unwinds, growth here is expected to moderate to just 0.2 per cent in 2026, “reflecting a technical base effect from 2025 dynamics, before stabilising at 2.9 per cent in 2027″. That means we’ll swing from growing at eight times the rate of the euro zone to growing at a fraction of the euro zone rate, all which means precious little to the average worker here with our GDP numbers now mere statistical noise.",left
"Sony is announcing the A7 V, its first camera with a partially stacked sensor and various features borrowed from pricier Alpha models. It will be available body-only in late December for $2,899, and a kit including a new 28-70mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS II lens is coming in February. Sony’s new A7 V uses a partially stacked sensor so you can shoot silently The jack-of-all-trades camera maintains 33 megapixels while inheriting features from other models. The jack-of-all-trades camera maintains 33 megapixels while inheriting features from other models. The A7 V is one of Sony’s most versatile all-purpose full-frame cameras, for enthusiasts and pros not looking to spend nearly $7,000 on an A1 II. The new A7 retains a 33-megapixel sensor like the A7 IV before it, but with a partially stacked design like Nikon’s Z6 III. Thanks to this tech, the A7 V can be used full time with its electronic shutter for totally silent shooting and blackout-free 30fps continuous bursts. While the Nikon Z6 III, as great as it is, had some controversies over its partially stacked sensor’s reduced dynamic range, Sony claims the A7 V’s sensor has 16 stops of latitude. Other features of the A7 V include a new Bionz XR2 processor with a dedicated AI chip for tracking autofocus and subject detection (like the A7R V), a new tilt screen (also first introduced on the A7R V), improved five-axis image stabilization (rated up to 7.5 stops), up to one second of pre-capture in continuous burst shooting, and a speed boost button that allows on-the-fly faster shooting (borrowed from the A9 III). The A7 V’s OLED electronic viewfinder is the same 3.68-million dot resolution as its predecessor, but it now supports a faster 120fps, and the live view feed switches more quickly from the LCD when you put your eye to it. Sony also managed to squeeze a bit more life out of the new model using the same NP-FZ100 battery — rated for an estimated 630 shots using the EVF or 750 with the LCD (an increase of 110 and 170 over last gen). The A7 V is designed as a hybrid for both stills and video, and its video chops have a significant improvement over the A7 IV. The new model records in oversampled 7K resolution to yield 4K 60p full-frame video, fixing one of the A7 IV’s biggest issues and oversights. The last-gen model relied on a 1.5x crop for its 4K 60p footage, whereas the A7 V now crops only to hit a high-speed 4K 120p for slow-motion work. As someone who owned and used the A7 IV professionally for about two years (before selling it to upgrade to another model), the A7 V has much of what I wish that camera could do for me. I got to use one for a very brief period, and being able to shoot silently in most situations like my other cameras is incredibly helpful for shooting freely in a quiet environment — like a wedding ceremony. One of my biggest gripes with my A7 IV was the delay while waiting for the live view to switch from the LCD to the EVF. The split-second moment of temporary blindness wasn’t egregiously long, but the A7 V’s faster switching brings it closer to the super-speedy feel of the pro A1 and A9 III cameras. I’m spoiled, I know, but once you adjust to it you don’t want to go back to a slower response time every time you pull up your second body. The A7 V’s new screen and ergonomic improvements are also welcome changes. I still don’t love Sony’s grip feel, even though they’re my cameras of choice, but Sony makes the best articulating screens around, offering the best of both worlds for photo and video. Up until now, these excellent screens have been reserved for pricier models, and I’m excited for more people to have access to them. It’s easy for the Sony A7 V to seem like a bit of a ho-hum update, kind of like last year’s A1 II upgrade was for pros. But Sony did a nice job focusing on refining and improving all of the base A7’s bread-and-butter features. It’s a greatest hits album of many of Sony’s recent new features. It’s a shame this line keeps getting pricier, as it’s launching at $500 more than the A7 IV’s original price and $200 more than the IV’s current tariff-inflated price, but new sensor tech is costlier sensor tech. Sony was quick to innovate and iterate on its Alpha cameras for years, giving it a massive head start in the mirrorless world ahead of Canon, Nikon, and others. But it’s been feeling like that innovation has stalled a bit in recent models. Now that Sony has played all its latest cards across its current crop and given its A7 V samples of its latest tech, we’ll have to see if Sony’s next generation of cameras can make any of the big jumps forward like it’s been previously known for.

"Trump is 'committed' to $2,000 tariff dividend payments, White House says This comes after the treasury secretary appeared to cast doubt on payments. President Donald Trump remains ""committed"" to sending each American a $2,000 dividend check to be distributed from tariff revenue, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday. White House officials are exploring ways to execute the plan put forward by Trump in a social media post over the weekend, Leavitt added, but she did not provide details about specific options. ""The president made it clear he wants to make it happen,"" Leavitt told reporters at the White House. ""So his team of economic advisers are looking into it."" The firm stance from the White House comes days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared to cast doubt on Trump's proposal, saying the payout could merely refer to tax savings enshrined by Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill legislation. A tariff dividend may come ""in lots of forms,"" Bessent told ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, adding that he had not spoken with Trump about the proposal. ""It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility on auto loans. Those are substantial deductions that are being financed in the tax bill,"" Bessent added. Some economists have questioned whether the dividend is achievable with available tariff funds. Trump announced the policy proposal in a brief message on social media on Sunday morning, focused on tariff-related tax revenue. ""People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k's are Highest EVER,"" the president wrote. ""A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone."" The message did not specify who would qualify for the payout or how the policy would operate. Two pandemic-era stimulus checks authorized by Trump were made available to individuals bringing in as much as $75,000 per year and couples earning up to $150,000. Beyond those benchmarks, higher earners were eligible for smaller payments. If Trump were to make the dividend payments available to anyone earning $100,000 or less, the policy would reach about 150 million Americans, amounting to roughly $300 billion in dividends, Erica York, a policy expert at the Tax Foundation, said in a post on X. As of Sept. 30, the federal government had generated $195 billion in tariff-related revenue, according to the Treasury Department. By that math, the estimated $300 billion cost of the dividend check proposal would far exceed the amount of currently available tariff revenue. In theory, however, the Trump administration could promise to pay the dividend from anticipated tariff revenue. The Treasury Department has forecast $3 trillion in tariff revenue over the next decade. Should the Trump administration choose that route, the dividend payments would add to the federal debt, which currently stands at over $38 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",left
"CEO challenging Trump at Supreme Court could trigger wave of tariff refunds: ""I definitely want my money back"" Rick Woldenberg says it's not in his nature, nor consistent with the mission of his Chicago-area toy business, to sit quietly in the face of an existential threat. So last April, a few weeks after the Trump administration unveiled sweeping tariffs on so-called ""Liberation Day,"" he took action. Woldenberg sued President Trump and his top advisers, alleging in a 37-page complaint Mr. Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs amounted to an illegal ""Executive Branch power grab."" After a lower court sided with Woldenberg in June, the Trump administration appealed, and on Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard the case to decide the fate of the president's signature economic policy. ""I just wasn't willing to be led to a slaughter by the politicians,"" Woldenberg told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Maurice DuBois. ""So we did what we're allowed to do, which is to push back."" Woldenberg heads Learning Resources, which manufactures most of its 2,000 educational toys in Asia. He has taken a path that stands in stark contrast to many top business leaders who grouse privately about the uncertainty wrought by Mr. Trump's tariffs but stay quiet in public or try to lobby the president behind closed doors. ""I'm not a politician and this is not a political movement,"" Woldenberg said. ""This is a lawsuit over the interpretation of a law."" The Supreme Court is being asked to weigh in on whether the president has the legal authority to levy tariffs on a foreign country in order to address a national emergency, such as the fentanyl crisis, illegal migration, or persistent trade deficits, all of which Mr. Trump has cited. Should the Court uphold his tariffs, Mr. Trump has said the decision would guarantee American prosperity. If Woldenberg prevails, the White House claims economic catastrophe would follow because the administration might be forced to pay back billions to American companies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month the U.S. would have to refund about half of the more than $200 million in tariff revenue collected this year. Woldenberg estimates a third of his 500 employees have had to shift their roles to focus on tariffs. Learning Resources has paid between $5 million and $10 million in tariffs this year so far. ""I definitely want my money back,"" he said. ""The government has chosen to hit us with a massive tax."" For years, Woldenberg has fought government attempts to infringe on his business. In 2009, he fought the Obama administration on tougher lead-testing rules in toys. And while he donated $7,000 to the Kamala Harris campaign in the 2024 election, Woldenberg insists his decision to sue the president isn't political. He has previously given to both Democrats and Republicans. On a recent Friday morning, workers at the company's 356,000-square-foot warehouse, north of Chicago, were preparing and loading shipments bound for big box retailers like WalMart and mom-and-pop toy stores nationwide. Woldenberg says factories in China and Vietnam have unique advantages: labor to assemble items like the company's ever-popular toddler cash register and source materials for products like ""BubblePlush,"" a new children's yoga ball that he expects to do well this Christmas. He said shifting production to the U.S. would be impossible. ""We can't do it,"" said Woldenberg, who took over in 1998 the business his family has run for decades. ""And we don't see our competitors doing it."" What they have done is play ""whack-a-mole,"" reacting to almost daily swings in the tariff rate. For example, after Mr. Trump took aim at China, raising the tariff rate to 145%, Learning Resources shifted some production to India. But then in August, the president raised India's tariff rate to 50%, and Woldenberg raced to ship those products to the U.S to avoid additional penalties. ""It was like a bat-outta-hell emergency,"" he said. ""And we had until Sept. 16 to clear customs in this country and the boat sauntered in six hours late. So, that cost us 50 grand."" Along with Woldenberg's case, the Supreme Court heard a similar case brought by five other small businesses and a group of Democratic state attorneys general. In that case, a federal appeals court ruled many of the president's tariffs are illegal. The case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of the most consequential of Mr. Trump's second-term policies. The high court has weighed in on an interim emergency basis on challenges to many of the president's initiatives, most recently in his bid to fire Federal Reserve commissioner Lisa Cook. Woldenberg said he's confident the Court will grant him relief. ""We and the hundreds of thousands of other similarly situated businesses will get the unlawfully collected taxes rebated to us,"" he said.",left
"Trump on rising NIL bidding wars: 'These colleges are all going to go out of business' ESPN's ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Nov. 11 was being filmed live from the Marines depot at Parris Island, S.C. on Veterans Day. So the Commander-in-Chief called. President Donald Trump joined the program and touched on a number of topics, including college sports. He was asked whether he felt former Alabama coach Nick Saban would be a choice to fix college sports. “Well I know him, and I got to know him because he brought his team to the White House,"" Trump said. ""He won a lot, and I got to know him. He’s a fantastic guy, and you know he’s somebody they should really get involved in college sports in terms of making sure it all works out because what’s happening, it looks like it’s not working out too well. Colleges, for most of the people, a lot of the lesser sports are being totally terminated, you know that, it’s a shame. It was almost like a training ground for the Olympics, and a lot of those training grounds are being lost. ""And you know, Nick knows this stuff better than anybody. He’d be, and he’s really active in it. I think they ought to let Nick Saban take a good, strong look at it, and we all, I could tell you, from my standpoint, I’d listen to what Nick has to say. I know him well, and he’s a fantastic guy, and what a great coach.” Trump's vision for college football Trump's vision for college sports aligns more with a Democrat-sponsored Senate bill. The SAFE Act is a far-reaching bill that requires the Federal Trade Commission to oversee college sports. It is nearly the polar opposite of the Republican-sponsored SCORE bill in the House, which seeks antitrust exemptions from the federal government to make and enforce rules on NIL, player movement and eligibility. The SAFE Act also provides for the expansion of the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 to college sports, allowing conferences to pool media rights in an effort to increase revenue and provide funding for all sports. The SAFE Act ensures all sports will be paid for, and not eliminated due to a lack of funding. In a follow-up, McAfee asked the president about NIL and the big business of college sports and its sustainability. ""I think we all understand that the players deserve money, I think we all understand their value, but I think an actual market with guardrails would be something that would be really good,"" McAfee said. ""This could be something, along with stopping wars, and building in tariffs and $17 trillion, maybe just put that on your desk."" “Well it is a very serious problem because even football where they give quarterbacks $12 million, $13-$14 million… all of a sudden you’re going to be out of control,"" Trump said. ""And even rich colleges are going to go bust because you’re not going to be able to do this. And you know they had the old way, they gave scholarships, they did lots of good things, but there could be some form of payment. ""But when they start bidding up the costs, look the NFL and all the leagues have caps. You don’t really have that in college sports, and when the guard comes along that weighs 350 pounds and he’s phenomenal and they say it’s the difference between having a great team and a lousy team, they gave him $10 million, that’s going to start happening pretty soon. All of a sudden you’re going to have like NFL-type payrolls. I don’t care how rich the colleges are, you don’t make that much money, even the most successful. They’re not going to be able to do this. ""Bad things are going to happen unless we figure this out. That’s why a guy like Nick Saban, now I’ve worked with Nick, but a guy like Nick Saban and some others getting together because they’re going to have to do something. Colleges can’t afford it. And what they’re doing, I don’t want to use any particular sport because it’s degrading, but they are really terminating a lot of sports, you know, sports you would call them lesser sports. But big sports, good sports. Sports where there have tremendous interest, they’re getting rid of them, and frankly the college football is very big, but as big as it is, if they don’t do some very powerful caps, these colleges are all going to go out of business, no matter how rich they are.”",left

"Delays, smaller payments: How SNAP funding will work The White House said it would give partial payments to 42 million recipients. The Trump administration said Monday it would provide partial payments to about 42 million food stamp recipients in November, though the White House warned the funds could take as long as months to reach households. The move promised some eventual relief as the government shutdown nears a record for the longest impasse in the nation’s history. The Trump administration, however, declined to use alternate funding that would have enabled the delivery of full SNAP benefits this month. The move to partially fund SNAP could delay benefits as states calculate and distribute the food subsidies, and the smaller payment may only grant recipients days or weeks before they face the threat of going without food anew, experts told ABC News. “The stress that families are facing throughout the country is tremendous, not knowing how they’re going to feed their families,” Colleen Heflin, a professor of public administration and international affairs at Syracuse University, told ABC News. Here’s what to know about SNAP funding. Is the Trump administration planning to provide SNAP benefits during the government shutdown? Yes, the Trump administration said it plans to expend partial funds for food stamp recipients in November. The emergency funding for SNAP will cover “50% of eligible households’ current allotments,” the Justice Department said in a court filing on Monday. The DOJ lawyers agreed to spend $4.65 billion on SNAP, which amounts to about half of the estimated $8 billion cost to fund SNAP in November. In the court filing, the Justice Department vowed to spend money available in a contingency fund for SNAP, giving individual states the opportunity to ""calculate the benefits available for each eligible household."" The disclosure came after a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funds to pay for SNAP amid an ongoing government shutdown. Will SNAP benefits be delayed? Some SNAP recipients were due to receive funds in the first few days of November, meaning their benefits have already been delayed. The logistical challenge posed by a partial delivery of benefits is expected to delay payments further, though the timeline will likely vary from state to state, experts told ABC News. Using emergency funds to pay for reduced SNAP benefits could take ""a few weeks to up to several months,"" a top U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) official told a federal judge in a sworn court filing on Monday. Since food stamps are administered at the state level, the USDA is expected to provide instructions to state agencies, which will then calculate the level of partial benefits for each recipient and provide those figures to be loaded onto the electronic cards used by families, Tracy Roof, a professor of political science at the University of Rhode Island who studies the food stamp program, told ABC News. ""The daunting part is that states have to go in and make this adjustment to their payment amounts,"" Roof said, estimating the operational hurdle could range from several days to more than a week after a federal directive, depending on the state. How will SNAP benefits be funded during the government shutdown? The Trump administration on Monday committed to spend SNAP funds available in an emergency account meant to aid families in the event of an interruption of the program. That reserve of contingency funds carries a total of about $6 billion, according to the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, putting the account well short of the $8 billion necessary to fully fund SNAP in November. The Trump administration said it would tap $4.65 billion in funds. The Trump administration opted against drawing upon a larger pot of money set aside for child nutrition programs by the Department of Agriculture. This alternate fund holds about $30 billion, far exceeding roughly $3 billion per month needed to fund the relevant child nutrition payments, David Super, a law professor at Georgetown University, told ABC News. The pot of money has built sizable reserves due to annual surpluses and an arrangement for the fund to share in a portion of tariff revenue, Super added. ""The Trump administration could transfer enough money over to SNAP to pay for full benefits in November without any conceivable risk to child nutrition,"" Super said, adding that the fund could likely also support full benefits in December ""without breaking a sweat."" How long will partial SNAP funding hold over families? The partial SNAP funding will amount to roughly half of a family’s typical monthly benefit, though the exact total could vary depending on the state and characteristics of a given beneficiary, experts said. Those partial benefits are expected to last recipients about two weeks, some experts said, noting the program could hold over families in the event of a speedy resolution of the government shutdown. ""But it’s certainly a lot of anxiety because people won’t know when they might expect to get the rest of the money,"" Roof said. Most states provide SNAP benefits on a staggered basis, meaning a portion of the recipients gain access at the outset of the month while others follow over the ensuing days or weeks. In turn, some recipients likely still retain benefits from October while others could be forced to go without funds during the current delay, the experts added. Could states make up for the loss of federal SNAP funding? Experts cast doubt on the capacity for state governments or philanthropic organizations to make up for the full shortfall in SNAP benefits. But some states, such as Virginia, have vowed to provide a comparable subsidy. ""States may legally be allowed to make up the lost funds but they haven’t been given a guarantee it will be reimbursed to them even after the government reopens,"" Parke Wilde, a food economist at Tufts University, told ABC News. Super, of Georgetown, noted that the financial burden of the food stamp payments would be significant for state governments. ""Fiscally, it’s a lot of money and I think the states would find it difficult to do,"" Super said. ""And operationally, there would be various steps that would need to be taken to make that happen, which some states are probably set up to do better than others.""",left
"This holiday season, tariffs are threatening the survival of a small Christmas supply business outside of Salt Lake City. Jared and Dawnita Hendricks have owned Village Lighting for 23 years, selling and distributing a variety of Christmas products to big box stores and directly to consumers online. The company currently employs 15 people. But when Village Lighting's 2025 holiday season garlands, wreaths, lights and decor arrived by ship at U.S. ports from Asia in recent months, many of them carried additional tariff costs of up to 50% per item. These added fees are the result of President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, which has raised U.S. import duties to levels not seen in over a century. The Trump administration claims tariffs will boost the U.S. economy in part by forcing manufacturers to move operations to the United States, and further by forcing U.S. trade partners to make concessions. But these global economic forces feel very far away from West Valley City, Utah, where tariff costs at Village Lighting are outpacing the company's expected profit margins. “The tariff costs in and of themselves are not sustainable, and I don’t believe we can raise the cost enough to the consumers to be profitable,” Jared Hendricks told NBC News during an interview at his warehouse in Utah. It’s an issue plaguing the entire Christmas decor industry, which for decades has relied on goods imported from Asia. American small businesses importing holiday decor this year have already spent more than $400 million on tariff fees, according to an estimate from a coalition of small businesses called “We Pay the Tariffs,” which counts Village Lighting among its members. Compared to the roughly $26 million these same companies paid in tariffs last year, that's an increase of at least 1,438%. Across the United States, companies of all sizes have tried to time their overseas orders in the hopes of avoiding the worst tariff fees. But for Village Lighting, which orders inventory up to a year in advance, this wasn't an option. After enjoying one of the company's most successful years ever in 2024, the Hendrickses decided to order extra inventory this year, a process that began last December and was completed by February. So when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners in early April, it was too late for the Hendrickses to cut back their orders, which were already loaded on container ships by the time the tariffs took effect. In an effort to keep their prices as low as possible, the Hendrickses have opted to absorb the majority of the added tariff costs. So far, that has cost them nearly $750,000 and counting. Tariffs are withdrawn directly from the couple’s bank account 30 days after each product arrives at a U.S. port. Their goal is to keep any retail price hikes under 5% this Christmas season. But the only way to do that, said Jared, was by “leveraging everything,” including their home, with a line of credit. “We went from working towards a profit to working for tariffs,” said Jared. “It’s affected our home life, our health. It has been the most stressful, difficult, challenging year of 23 years of businesses that we ever had.” This isn't the first time Village Lighting has had to contend with abrupt changes to tariff rates. During the first Trump administration, average U.S. tariff rates on Chinese imports swelled to around 20%, up from a simple tariff rate of just 2.8% in 2015. The Hendrickses responded at the time by attempting to diversify their supply chain across several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, Cambodia and Malaysia. But these countries were all hit with high tariffs in early April of this year, swept up in Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs. At that point, said Jared, all his planning “went out the window.” Moving Village Lighting’s manufacturing operations to the United States would be nearly impossible, the Hendrickses say, because of the type of complex machinery and skilled labor that are required to make the Christmas goods they sell. “A dozen different factories go into one wreath or garland,” Jared said. “It’s not a matter of me opening up one factory. It’s a matter of me opening up two dozen factories and somehow providing a pathway to get raw materials.” He said that it was unlikely “that anyone in our situation could ever financially find a way to make that happen.” The Hendrickses are not alone in feeling the sting of tariffs this holiday season. Consumers are dealing with it, too. According to a recent survey from the National Retail Federation, 85% of shoppers expect to pay more this year because of tariffs. And they’re right — Lending Tree, an online lending marketplace, found that tariffs will cost the average American an additional $132 on their holiday expenses this year. Goldman Sachs estimates that consumers are picking up as much as 55% of overall tariff costs. The Hendrickses said they feel like small businesses are bearing the brunt of Trump’s tariff pains. “When there was Covid, it felt like the whole country was kind of in it together,” said Dawnita Hendricks. “This kind of feels like it’s just us against the failure of our business, because of something we cannot control.” That lack of control is clouding Village Lighting’s future. “After 23 years, you kind of start thinking about, What’s the second half of my life going to look like?” said Jared. “Are we going to be able to move to the next level so that we can retire and enjoy our grandchildren and whatever?” Tariffs, he said, “really just put a halt to that and made us question, ‘What’s next?’”",left
"You can’t say that Team Trump is in denial about the extent and the implications of the electoral rebuke its party received on November 4. All of a sudden, from the president on down, Republicans can’t stop talking about affordability. Donald Trump himself alternates between claiming he’s already pushed the cost of living way down and publicly mulling ways to convince Americans to feel better about their ability to make ends meet. Obviously Republicans need to improve the president’s sinking job-approval numbers in anticipation of high-stakes midterm elections. But more immediately, the GOP must decide how to deal with the health-insurance “cliff” it created by failing to extend Obamacare premium subsidies in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and then refusing Democratic demands to fix the problem in legislation reopening the government. Republicans clearly can’t bring themselves to just extend the subsidies, even with the concessions on their cost and eligibility that Democrats would almost certainly accept. The Senate vote they promised on the issue by December will likely fall short of any actual results, and House Republicans are signaling unmistakably that they have no stomach for anything that looks like a blessing of the hated legacy health-care program of the 44th president (which they are now calling the Unaffordable Care Act). Recognizing that Democrats won’t agree to any “Obamacare alternative,” the White House is making it known they are warming to the idea of a second budget reconciliation bill (the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was the first) that would include health care and other goodies as part of a midterm “affordability” agenda, as Politico reports: “We’re going to have the health care conversation. We’re going to put some legislation forward,” White House deputy chief of staff James Blair said Tuesday at a Bloomberg Government policy breakfast. He expressed interest in a bipartisan health plan but said that “if that path is foreclosed, there is the partisan path of reconciliation as well.” Such a move would allow Republicans to advance a health plan with a simple majority, a path they unsuccessfully attempted in Trump’s first term to repeal Obamacare but successfully used earlier this year on the megabill … If a reconciliation bill moves soon, Blair indicated that the administration would also want to include “probably the Trump tariff dividends and … interest in locking in tariffs.” That last sentence is important. The conventional wisdom is that you don’t move major controversial legislation in an election year. In addition, most Republicans remember that the 2017 reconciliation bill aimed at repealing and replacing Obamacare failed, while a later tax-cut bill succeeded. So if they’re going back to the well on “Trumpcare,” they’ll need some sweeteners, and the so-called tariff dividends, which are really just stimulus checks under another name, would fill the bill. The other strong possibility is that the administration and its allies will structure “Trumpcare 2.0” to look a lot like free money as well. The president himself has been hitting this angle at Truth Social: THE ONLY HEALTHCARE I WILL SUPPORT OR APPROVE IS SENDING THE MONEY DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PEOPLE, WITH NOTHING GOING TO THE BIG, FAT, RICH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHO HAVE MADE $TRILLIONS, AND RIPPED OFF AMERICA LONG ENOUGH. THE PEOPLE WILL BE ALLOWED TO NEGOTIATE AND BUY THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, INSURANCE. POWER TO THE PEOPLE! Congress, do not waste your time and energy on anything else. This is the only way to have great Healthcare in America!!! GET IT DONE, NOW. President DJT In reality, what he’s almost certainly talking about is the ancient Republican scheme of returning to the days before comprehensive health insurance was a thing and, instead of subsidizing insurance premiums, giving individuals some money to combine with their own savings to pay for all non-catastrophic health costs out of pocket. If you’re young and healthy, it could be a hell of a deal. If you’re older, sicker, or poorer, maybe not so much, particularly if the “new deal” on health care is paid for by cuts in safety-net programs like Medicaid (which was the case in the 2017 Trumpcare legislation). Although there are many devils in the details, what may make this approach attractive is the more money for you angle Trump is already promoting. If packaged in a bill that also provides “tariff dividends,” and perhaps more middle-class tax breaks like the ones used to dress up OBBBA, you could have purely partisan election-year legislation that addresses affordability concerns by literally giving cash to voters. Will that do anything to reduce inflation? No, and in fact, it could have the opposite effect. But it doesn’t even have to be enacted to serve as a vehicle for GOP midterm messaging, and even if it is, the economic and fiscal fallout would be mañana. It’s always possible Republicans will rethink this approach and compromise with Democrats to deal with the immediate Obamacare premium spike in a direct way and put off their dreams of undoing the Affordable Care Act until later. If they were really clever, they’d design an Obamacare subsidy extension that would expire if and when Trumpcare is a reality. But it’s unlikely they’ll be able to bring themselves to even a temporary compromise when the chimera of buying off the electorate while bypassing Obamacare seems possible.

"The US Department of Agriculture ordered states to stop issuing full food stamp benefits for November and to “immediately undo” any issuance of the full allotments, after a Supreme Court justice on Friday paused a lower court order requiring the agency to pay Americans their full assistance. In the Saturday directive, obtained by CNN, the USDA told states to instead proceed with issuing partial benefits — which will provide 65% of the maximum allotments for November — as ordered by the same lower court judge earlier in the week. (Many recipients will receive less than 65% of their usual assistance because of the way food stamp benefits are calculated.) “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.” States that fail to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over issuances of benefits, the memo said. This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly 1 in 8 Americans who depend on the nation’s larger anti-hunger program. Over the past week, the USDA has issued guidance multiple times as lawsuits over the agency’s decision not to tap into a contingency fund to pay November benefits have worked their way through federal courts. The latest guidance follows a memorandum from the department on Friday saying it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal lower court order, and that the process should be completed later that day. Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in coming days. Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Friday that residents who should have already gotten their SNAP benefits this month will start getting their full payments on Friday. The next day, a Shapiro spokesperson told CNN that residents who received their benefits are able to spend them, but the state has paused issuing full allocations to additional people. Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that there’s “no clarity at all” in the guidance and that the administration is causing “intentional chaos.” “Once we decided to step up and say we are going to make sure that our people are going to be OK … we’ve now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money,” Moore said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Legal battles Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday evening temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to cover full food stamp benefits, siding with the administration on a short-term basis in a legal fight that has quickly become a defining confrontation of the government shutdown. The ruling meant the USDA does not have to immediately honor a lower court order that required it to transfer $4 billion to the key food assistance program. Jackson’s ruling followed one a day earlier by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island that directed the agency to make the full payments, reversing his own order from earlier in the month requiring the USDA to tap into its $5.3 billion contingency fund to pay at least partial benefits for the month. His more expansive ruling mandated the agency shift tariff revenue meant for child nutrition programs to pay full SNAP benefits for November. The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in appropriations for the government. The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling in recent weeks that the agency must at least pay partial benefits or, at its discretion, provide recipients with their full allotments. The agency opted to provide partial payments — first saying states could issue 50% of the maximum benefit and then revising the figure to 65%. But the USDA warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. The plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case raced back to McConnell last week to argue that he should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly. McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month. Providing full benefits Wisconsin immediately filed for 100% of its residents’ benefits to be placed on their electronic benefit transfer cards, according to the Department of Justice’s filing to the Supreme Court. But the USDA rejected the request because it had not yet had time to comply with McConnell’s order. That resulted in the state overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million. Responding to the USDA’s demand that states should undo any steps taken to issue full benefits, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said on Sunday, “No.” The state loaded November benefits onto the cards of nearly 700,000 residents on Friday prior to the Supreme Court’s pause, he said in a statement. “We are eager for the court to resolve this issue by directing the Trump Administration to comply with court orders and provide the certainty to the many Wisconsin families and businesses who rely on FoodShare,” he said. Similarly, Kansas issued full benefits worth nearly $32 million to approximately 86,000 households in the state, the filing said. These actions have hurt states that did not move quickly to issue benefits, according to the DOJ. They will be unable to receive funding to provide partial payments to their residents under McConnell’s prior order. Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly reacted to the Supreme Court’s action in a statement Friday night, saying, “In accordance with a court’s order and after receiving guidance from the USDA, Kansas sent full November SNAP benefits to all eligible Kansans. These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates.” North Carolina, which issued partial benefits to more than 586,000 households on Friday, said it was pausing the issuance of full benefits in light of the Supreme Court decision. It had hoped to issue them over the weekend. “The hard-working people and families who rely on SNAP benefits deserve certainty, not confusion about whether they’ll be able to put meals on the table this weekend and the rest of the month,” North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement Saturday. “I am urging for a swift resolution by the courts and some humanity from the Trump administration so North Carolina families can receive the support they need.” In Massachusetts, Democratic Gov. Maura Healey said that residents should continue spending the benefits on their EBT cards, noting the state funded them in accordance with USDA’s Friday guidance before the Supreme Court’s pause. “If President Trump wants to penalize states for preventing Americans from going hungry, we will see him in court,” Healey said in a statement Sunday, adding that state officials will continue to work to “make sure everyone gets the full benefits they are owed.” CNN is reaching out to other states to ask the status of their SNAP programs. CNN’s John Fritze and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",left

"Trump administration announces trade frameworks with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador Washington — The Trump administration has reached frameworks for reciprocal trade agreements with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador, the White House announced Thursday, although details of the frameworks are still emerging. The tariff rate for most goods from Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina will continue to be 10%, while Ecuador will remain at 15%, senior administration officials told reporters on a briefing call. But there will be tariff relief on a number of items, particularly those that can't be grown in the U.S. Senior administration officials didn't list those items, nor do the joint statements about the frameworks released by the White House, but one senior administration official anticipated that coffee and bananas from Ecuador, for instance, would see tariff relief. ""The United States commits to remove its reciprocal tariffs on certain qualifying exports from Ecuador that cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States in sufficient quantities,"" the framework joint statement for Ecuador released by the White House says. Senior administration officials couldn't provide details on how the trade agreements would affect the cost of goods like coffee, cocoa or bananas, which the U.S. imports from Central and South American nations, although one senior administration official said it would likely have ""positive"" effects. Those specific commodities are important because ""we don't make those in the United States,"" the official said. ""Our expectation is that there will be some positive effects for prices for things like coffee, cocoa, bananas,"" the official said. The White House said the administration will work to finalize the agreements in the coming weeks. Senior administration officials said the agreement frameworks are largely focused on allowing those foreign markets to accept more U.S. goods. Generally, the agreements also aim to open up markets to import U.S. agricultural products and to prohibit imposing digital services taxes on U.S. companies. The U.S. has reached trade deals of some nature with the European Union, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea and the United Kingdom, among other countries.",left
"'It's insane': ACA policyholders say soaring health insurance premiums are jeopardizing lives One said she's being ""run out of my country because of healthcare costs."" Colorado mom Astrid Storey, a thyroid cancer patient with an autoimmune disorder, was recently notified that her monthly premiums under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will jump by nearly $500 in 2026. A naturalized U.S. citizen from Panama, she said she's now contemplating what was once unthinkable: giving up her American dream and moving to a country with universal health care. Nathan Boye of Orlando, Florida, has diabetes and said he's been informed the monthly premiums for his ACA policy would soar from $28 to more than $700. The married father-of-three said he is now considering foregoing health insurance altogether. And Doug Butchart, whose wife, Shadene, is living with the neurological disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) said he doesn't know how he's going to pay for her medications. A retired mechanic from Elgin, Illinois, Butchart said he's gotten a notice that the monthly premiums on his wife's ACA policy will climb to $2,000. Combined with an annual deductible of more than $8,000 and $10,000 in out-of-pocket expenses, he said his wife's health care costs will total more than his monthly Social Security check, which they both live on. An estimated 22 million of the 24 million ACA marketplace enrollees are currently receiving enhanced premium tax credits to lower their monthly premiums, which were part of the original ACA legislation and expanded in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic under the American Rescue Plan. But with the tax credits set to expire at the end of this year, many policyholders are learning the ACA, commonly referred to as Obamacare, will no longer be affordable unless Congress intervenes. An extension of the tax credits was not included in President Donald Trump's megabill, which was signed into law in July. The issue has become a political football, prolonging the government shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history. The majority of Democrats have refused to vote to reopen the government until Republicans agree to extend the ACA subsidies. But GOP leaders say they won't negotiate until a clean funding bill passes and the government reopens. As both sides blame each other for the shutdown, millions of Americans who bought into the ACA marketplace find themselves caught in the crossfire of the stalemate. Premiums set to rise even without the tax credits Storey, a graphic designer and owner of a small business in Denver, said she doesn't receive the ACA tax credits. But in a notice from her insurance provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, which she shared with ABC News, her monthly premiums are set to rise from $1,400 to nearly $1,900. ""I have an autoimmune disease, and I also have thyroid cancer. So, I had very specific needs as to which doctors and which medicines I needed to have covered in this plan,"" Storey said, adding that she has a $2,000 deductible and many out-of-pocket expenses. Storey, 45, said she purchased her policy through Connect for Health Colorado, her state's ACA portal, and has been working with a broker provided by the insurance carrier to help navigate the added costs. Storey said her husband, Denis, who has been doing contracting work for her business, has taken a part-time job at a Starbucks to help make ends meet. But Storey said there is a limit to how much more she can pay for health care. If her premium rises to $2,500 a month, she said that she and her family will sell all their belongings and leave the country. Storey said she also has citizenship in Panama and Spain, the latter of which has universal health care. ""I have a lot of feelings about being run out of my country because of health care costs,"" Storey said. ""The American dream is a disappointment when it comes to health care."" In a statement to ABC News, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said that its ACA plan rates ""reflect the care and costs we expect members to use next year. Like other insurers, we’re seeing higher utilization and more complex care among ACA members -- particularly in emergency room visits, behavioral health and specialty pharmacy. For instance, ACA members use the ER at nearly twice the rate of those with employer-sponsored coverage."" Laid off due to tariffs, now facing more than a 2,500% jump in premiums Boye, from Florida, said he currently pays $28 a month for his ACA plan through Blue Cross Blue Shield, and that 90% of the medications he needs to control his diabetes are covered. He was notified last month that the monthly premium is set to rise to $733 without financial help, a 2,518% increase. Boye told ABC News on Thursday that after doing more research and reapplying through the ACA portal, he found a plan that has monthly premiums of $113 a month, contingent on a $620 tax credit. Boye said he qualified for the ACA tax credits after he was laid off earlier this year as an operations manager for a company that imported medical supplies from China. ""We had to close down because of the tariff. It made it impossible to import,"" Boye said. While he has picked up part-time work, he said he enrolled at Valencia College in Orlando to finish his degree in business administration. His wife, he said, has insurance through her job as a teacher's assistant at the University of Central Florida, where she is also studying history. He said their three children, ages 11 to 16, are insured through Medicaid. Boye said he won't be able to pay the increase in his premiums, and is hoping Congress works out a deal to restore the ACA tax credits. He said he has until mid-December to reenroll in his plan. But if the tax credits are not restored, Boye said he is contemplating making a radical change. ""I gave up on the idea of having health care,"" Boye said. Boye said he's already started researching discount drug companies and cash-pay programs on how he can purchase on his own the two primary medications he uses to control diabetes. He showed ABC News an invoice he got in September indicating his insurance covered the $1,669 price of his primary medication, Jardiance. Boye said his current predicament has left him feeling like a ""tiny fish that does not matter."" ""Realistically, I have no control over any of this,"" he said. ""I'm just a person who has to navigate the waters and find a solution."" In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Florida Blue said that, next year, there will be ""higher insurance costs for many, and government financial help (premium tax credits) will decrease if the enhanced premium tax credits expire, as they are planned to."" The organization said it understood members' concerns and is committed to supporting members, but added that premium increases ""are an industry-wide issue, a necessary but concerning response to federal regulatory changes including the scheduled expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits at the end of 2025, as well as the rising cost and utilization of medical care and prescription drugs."" 'It’s real people that all of this is affecting' The Butcharts, from Illinois, traveled to Washington, D.C., this week with members of the Muscular Dystrophy Association to discuss their precarious situation with congressional leaders, including their two Illinois senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, both Democrats. The 67-year-old Doug Butchart said he wanted to show the lawmakers ""that it's for real, that it's real people that all of this is affecting."" Butchart said he has received notification, which he shared with ABC News, that the monthly premiums on his wife's ACA policy through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois will rise from $603.82 to up to $2,000 without the tax credits in 2026. According to the notice he received, even with a tax credit estimated at $738, the monthly premium would be nearly $1,400. ""It's insane,"" Butchart told ABC News. He said his 58-year-old wife was diagnosed with ALS eight years ago, adding that about 10% of ALS patients survive that long. Butchart said his wife's main medication, Radicava, costs about $15,000 a month, and another medication costs $4,000 for a three-month supply. While insurance has covered most of their medical costs, Butchart said his wife's out-of-pocket expenses last year were about $3,000. He said that without the tax credits, and on top of the increased monthly premiums, his wife will have an $8,000 deductible in 2026, and her out-of-pocket expenses could top $10,000. ""That's a lot of money, way more money than we get in a year,"" said Butchart. He said he and his wife live off his Social Security income and that she does not qualify for Medicaid or any disability income. ""I don't want to put ourselves in a position where we're in debt. I'm not 20 years old or 30 years old where I can go out and get a second job,"" Butchart said. In a statement to ABC News, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois said it ""remains steadfast in its commitment to a stable health insurance market with competitive plan choices in the individual market, as we have since the inception of the ACA."" ""The rates for 2026 coverage include both new and current individual ACA-compliant plans and reflects industry-wide changes to the market, including the anticipated expiration of enhanced premium tax credits at the end of 2025. Plans are priced to reflect anticipated health care needs,"" the company said. But Butchart said the he still doesn't see how the company can ""justify"" such increases in premiums. “I wish the people who are making decisions and setting the prices were in the same position as we are,"" Butchart said.

"Generations work on family farms. With costs high and prices low, farmers worry they may lose it all. Tennessee farmer Franklin Carmack is haunted by concerns that he could lose the family farm. Carmack, a fifth-generation farmer, has been forced to take on work outside his fields — selling T-shirts, driving trucks and repairing boats — to try and ease his financial burden. It's affected his health, Carmack said, and he now takes four blood pressure pills a day. He thinks about the issue when he goes to bed at night. ""What's gonna be left in a year, two years? Am I the one that broke what started in the late 1800s?"" Carmack said he wonders. He's not alone: America's farmers are facing high costs, low prices and challenges from tariffs. Major row crops, including corn, soybeans, cotton and wheat, have not been profitable since at least 2022, according to United States Department of Agriculture data. Farmer frustrations Carmack and longtime friend Jeffrey Daniels grow cotton, soybeans and corn on their respective family farms. This year, instead of showing off crops at the West Tennessee State Fair, the pair sold T-shirts, made from cotton they grew, in an attempt to offset their losses in the fields. They sold about 250 shirts for $35 each, but it was hardly enough. This year, they expect to lose nearly $800,000 combined. Times are especially tough now because of input costs: everything a farmer needs to pull income from the ground, such as seed, equipment parts and fertilizer. Those costs have increased by more than 30% in the last five years, according to USDA data. This is, in part, due to inflation and rising interest rates. Cotton farmers have struggled with dwindling prices and decreased global demand as clothing manufacturers use more synthetic fabrics. ""The morale in the farming industry, not just farmers, is the lowest I've ever seen,"" Carmack said. ""Everybody's on edge."" In the first six months of 2025, there were 57% more farm bankruptcies than during the same period last year, according to United States Courts. Tariffs and the promise of federal help Daniels and Carmack say tariffs have made this year even harder. Soybeans have long been the largest U.S. export crop, worth nearly $25 billion last year, according to USDA. China, which primarily uses soybeans to feed its massive livestock industry, was the largest foreign buyer of America's soybeans. Sales ground to a halt in May when China stopped buying all U.S. soybeans as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs. Following a meeting last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mr. Trump said the additional 100% tariffs on certain imports from China, which he previously said would take effect Nov. 1, will not be implemented. Tariffs have also impacted the prices farmers pay to buy equipment. ""Anything that comes from China that's on that sprayer, there's a tariff and they're just going to pass it directly to us,"" Daniels said. Last week, Mr. Trump and Xi reached a one-year trade deal. But farmers said whatever comes next, the problems on farms run deep. ""Do you just keep going, rolling the dice, hoping things will turn? I mean, it's not looking good,"" Daniels said. Mr. Trump has promised a new bailout for American farmers – as much as $13 billion that he said would be paid for by the tariffs. ""It will help pay some bills, but that's not fixing the problem. It's a Band-Aid when we need stitches,"" Carmack said. Carmack and Daniels, like many farmers 60 Minutes spoke with in Tennessee and Missouri, said they'd rather work their fields than rely on taxpayer money. High numbers of suicides among farmers Farmers 60 Minutes met with say there are also worries about suicide in agricultural communities. Concerns for neighbors rise when crop sales drop. The suicide rate among agriculture workers is three times higher than it is among the general working population, according ot the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's most recent data in 2021. 60 Minutes' reporting shows that many rural mental health groups are seeing increased crisis calls to their hotlines. Jolie Foreman, who runs Shelby County Cares, a nonprofit organization focused on the high number of suicides among farmers, said her county has the highest rate of suicide per capita in the state of Missouri. The county has one therapist for about 6,000 people. ""[We] cannot really determine our success,"" Foreman said. ""We only can calculate the losses."" Though it's difficult to know how many lives have been saved, Foreman said she believes her program is working. In neighboring Macon County, Missouri, just a few miles away, there were two confirmed farm suicides this year. Foreman said she worries she could see an increase in the suicide rate because of the bleak financial situation for farmers. Shelby County Cares connects farmers with therapists, either in person or remotely. Foreman said walk-ins and calls to her office have increased since the beginning of the year. She's learned the best way to get farmers, who are traditionally stoic and fiercely independent, to talk is through their wives and through sharing food. Foreman said she personally knew farmers who took their own lives. ""In my own family, we've definitely had tragedy and have lost some very, you know, important people in our own family,"" she said. Since the 1970s, Foreman's father-in-law, Brent Foreman, has lost three relatives — all farmers — to suicide. Two neighbors of the family farm also recently took their own lives. ""I've always had a fear for my kids and now my grandkids that we sure don't want history to repeat itself,"" he said. ""You know, no matter how bad things get, things always have a way of working out. They'll always get better."" Faith in Trump's plan Brent Foreman and his son Jarrell grow more than 1,000 acres of soybeans and 650 acres of corn on a farm they manage themselves. They also raise more than 200 head of cattle, which means they are not reliant on soybeans as their sole source of income and can afford to wait for details on Mr. Trump's new trade deal. ""I have a lot of faith in him, and a lot of trust in him. And I think he's trying to make us the best deal he can for the whole country, but for the American farmer, for the long term,"" Brent Foreman said. Nearly 80% of voters in what are called farming-dependent counties voted for Mr. Trump in the last election, according to Investigate Midwest. ""I feel like a lot of American farmers, cattle people, it's a lot, a lot of people probably feel let down,"" Daniels said. ""Maybe there's a method to the madness, you know, that's still to be seen."" Many are now taking their frustrations directly to Republican lawmakers at town halls across the country. Carmack welcomed Mr. Trump to visit his farm. ""I'd show him the daily life that I do from cleaning equipment, running equipment, dispatching trucks,"" Carmack said. ""And then I'd hand him a stack of bills. And then I would show him the receipts, what I'm getting from my crop. He's a smart man. I'm not going to take that away from him. And it won't take him the five minutes to say, 'This isn't going to work.'""

"Costco seeks 'full refund' for tariffs in new lawsuit against Trump administration President Donald Trump imposed a flurry of tariffs earlier this year. Wholesale giant Costco has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for a ""full refund"" on import duties the company says it paid this year under global tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed by Costco at the U.S. Court of International Trade on Nov. 28, states that Congress, not the president, has the power to impose tariffs. Trump imposed a flurry of global tariffs in April, citing the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which gives the president power to regulate international commerce in the event of an ""unusual and extraordinary threat."" On Monday, Costco filed a motion to combine its lawsuit with nearly two dozen other lawsuits previously filed by other U.S. companies challenging the legality of Trump's IEEPA tariffs. ""The complaints are materially identical in allegations, theories, and ultimate requested relief,"" Costco wrote in its motion. One of the previously filed lawsuits is currently pending a decision at the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court strikes down Trump's tariffs, more than $90 billion of refunds could be owed. A decision is expected early next year. Costco's lawsuit states that the Court of International Trade and other federal courts ""have agreed the IEEPA duties are not authorized"" and are unlawful. ""This separate action is necessary, however, because even if the IEEPA duties and underlying executive orders are held unlawful by the Supreme Court, importers that have paid IEEPA duties, including Plaintiff, are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief,"" the lawsuit states. Costco, a membership warehouse club with over 800 locations across the U.S., according to its website, is seeking an immediate injunction against having to pay additional tariffs on products already imported while the Supreme Court case is pending. Costco is also seeking a refund for the tariff payments it incurred. In a statement to ABC News on Tuesday, White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said, ""The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court’s speedy and proper resolution of this matter."" Costco declined to comment on the lawsuit. ABC News' Taylor Dunn contributed to this report.",left
"Sen. Amy Klobuchar says ""future of capitalism"" at stake in Supreme Court tariffs case The Supreme Court sounded skeptical on Wednesday about President Trump's sweeping tariff agenda. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota attended the hearing and joins ""The Takeout"" with her takeaways.",left
"During both his presidential terms, Donald Trump has longed to make Americans happy by mailing them checks from the government adorned with his own signature in case anyone wants to write him a thank-you note in the form of a vote. So it’s not surprising that his big idea for responding to the rise of “affordability” as a national political issue is to send out $2,000 checks, allegedly to be financed by his trade-war tariffs. Do people think tariffs boost consumer prices? Okay, then, here’s a rebate! Or a “tariff dividend,” as he calls it. Now, that is very unlikely to come to pass for a variety of reasons. For one thing, Trump is vastly overestimating the tariff revenue that’s coming in. For another, his own administration and perhaps soon the Supreme Court are putting the brakes on his tariff offensive. And even more obviously, authorizing $2,000 checks from Trump for everybody at this particular moment has zero support among Democrats and not much support among Republicans, who mostly seem to be rolling their eyes over it. If they take it seriously at all, they tend to recommend that any “tariff dividends,” should they actually emerge, be used to reduce the public debt that Trump has never seemed to worry about for a moment. But the most telling (not to mention hilarious) reaction to the “tariff dividend” idea has come from Trump’s own Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, as Axios reported: The administration is hopeful Americans won’t necessarily spend the $2,000 tariff checks President Trump has promised, and instead pump them into “Trump accounts” for kids, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says … The risk of rising prices remains a huge concern for consumers, and against that backdrop, Fox News asked Bessent Tuesday night how the government would avoid another bout of stimulus-driven inflation if the checks happen. “Maybe we could persuade Americans to save that, because one of the things that’s going to happen next year” is the start of “Trump accounts” to save for kids, Bessent said. So the president wants to send checks to folks who are worried about making ends meet today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. But his top economic adviser is telling them not to cash those checks to pay for their living costs but to save them instead because (quite accurately) spending the money might boost living costs even more. Bessent was clever enough to couch this blatant contradiction of the president’s wishes in a recommendation that the money should go into Trump-branded savings vehicles (the subsidized kiddie savings accounts created by the One Big Beautiful Act). But it’s probably not what the president had in mind when he imagined grateful Americans using those checks to pay for groceries and gasoline while uttering a prayer of thanksgiving for their benefactor the president — and vowing to vote Republican in the 2026 midterms. Vote-buying is a simple proposition, but the people around Trump keep trying to complicate it. No wonder he’s angry and frustrated about “affordability.”",left
"President Donald Trump said on Friday that any document signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen ""is hereby terminated."" ""I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden,"" Trump posted on his social media platform. It is unclear which orders Trump is referencing and how he is making those determinations. ABC News has reached out to the White House for more information. Trump claimed that the people who ""operated the Autopen did so illegally."" But the Justice Department's legal counsel states that autopens are lawful for signing bills into law. The president has repeatedly fixated on Biden's use of the autopen. In June, Trump claimed Biden aides illegally used the autopen to carry out ""radical"" policies and ordered the Justice Department and White House to investigate Biden’s mental state when he was in office. At the time, Biden issued a statement to ABC News calling the probe “nothing more than a mere distraction.” ""Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,"" Biden said in the June statement. Trump has said he has used an autopen for some trivial matters, but criticized its use for pardons. -ABC News' Lalee Ibssa and Selina Wang",left
"Many Americans worried about high prices might expect some relief if a deeply skeptical Supreme Court reins in President Donald Trump’s tariffs. If you’re among them, don’t get your hopes up. In a consequential Supreme Court case Wednesday, a majority of the justices expressed concern that Trump may have overstepped his authority in levying tariffs with practically zero limits. Trump has imposed enormous import taxes in a number of unprecedented ways: He placed tariffs high enough to effectively serve as a temporary embargo on all Chinese goods, retaliated against Brazil’s conviction of its former president and Trump ally Jair Bolsanaro, and pressured India to ditch Russian oil. Those tariffs have begun to raise some prices for Americans, who ranked the cost of living as the most important issue facing the country in a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Nearly three quarters (72%) of Americans say the US economy is in bad shape, and 61% say Trump’s policies have made economic conditions worse. The Supreme Court may ultimately rule the bulk of Trump’s tariffs – his signature economic policy – to be illegal. But that wouldn’t give Americans much of a breather: Tariffs haven’t raised prices as much as you may think. And Trump has other tools to raise tariffs even if the Supreme Court rules against him. Tariffs’ limited effect The US government’s inflation data shows tariffs have started to gradually raise some prices, particularly for goods that are almost exclusively imported, such as shoes and furniture. Still, the overall pace of price hikes has been far from dramatic. Annual inflation rose to 3% in September, the highest rate since January but far from the 9% rate during the post-pandemic inflation crisis. Tariffs have had a limited impact for a number of reasons. - Trump delayed the implementation of his most consequential tariffs multiple times. - Businesses stockpiled goods ahead of Trump’s tariffs. - Foreign trading partners (with the notable exception of China) largely chose not to retaliate, so the global trade war sort of never happened as expected. - Businesses have – for the most part – eaten much of the tariffs’ cost. That’s not to say tariffs are inconsequential. Businesses have chosen to pay roughly 80% of the tariffs’ cost – for now – according to a recent JPMorgan analysis. And what you’re not feeling in your pocket, you may be feeling in your job prospects: That hit to companies’ profit has contributed to America’s slowing job market, JPMorgan economist Michael Hanson says. And consumers could still pay more of tariffs’ cost down the line. There’s mounting evidence companies are preparing to pass along those costs: Recent Producer Price Index reports showed that businesses are beginning to raise their wholesale prices, indicating many companies have reached the limit of what they can pay for before charging customers more. And CEOs on recent earnings calls have said some higher prices are inevitable. “There is no free lunch,” Hanson said. “We continue to expect that consumers ultimately will foot most of the tariff bill.” Nevertheless, most inflation-weary Americans are upset with the economy because the cumulative effect of higher prices have been wreaking havoc on the economy for the past five years – not because of tariffs, specifically. The typical household is spending $1,043 more per month than they did at the start of 2021 – for the same stuff, according to Moody’s. Paychecks haven’t kept up. Inflation rose to a four-decade high in 2022. That means an entire generation of Americans had never experienced anything like the surging prices of the past several years. Although inflation – the rate of those price hikes – has since returned to normal, those higher prices haven’t really had time to settle into the country’s psyche. People are still shocked when they compare the prices they’re paying now to what they were paying just a few years ago. Typically, price hikes occur gradually, in such small increments you hardly notice. And for some products, like new technology, prices can actually fall over time as supply increases – that’s why you can get a high-quality gigantic 4K TV for a couple hundred bucks now, when those TVs would set you back thousands a few years ago. This is something different: The first inflation shock many Americans experienced hasn’t yet worn off, and tariffs are a convenient – if largely inaccurate – foil for their pain. Trump can still impose tariffs The Supreme Court isn’t exactly Sonic the Hedgehog. Even with an expedited case, the justices may not rule for several months. In the meantime, Trump can continue to impose his tariffs, and price hikes may ultimately start to take hold of the economy. But if the Supreme Court ultimately rules that the bulk of his tariffs are illegal, Trump has other options, including other laws he’s already used to raise some import levies. They may be more restrictive than his broad use of emergency powers, but they’re not part of the current case before the Supreme Court. For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the president to raise tariffs on national security grounds. Trump has used that to raise steel, aluminum and copper tariffs. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to raise tariffs on nations deemed to violate trade agreements. And Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, although never used, would allow the president to raise tariffs up to 50% on countries if they’re believed to be engaged in discriminatory trade practices. Trump called the case “life or death.” But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Erin Burnett Wednesday that he disagreed with the president. “It’s a factor,” Dimon said. “But it may not be the deciding factor” in whether the US economy keeps growing.

"For some hurting U.S. soybean farmers, a trade deal with China may not be enough to save the farm American farmers have long struggled with high costs and low prices for their crops. But this year there is even greater uncertainty in the fields. China stopped buying all U.S. soybeans in May — retaliation for President Trump's tariffs. Many American farmers were left without their largest export market. President Trump and China's president Xi Jinping came to a temporary truce. But farmers told us that whatever happens next with tariffs, the problems on their farms continue to run deep. We went to rural Tennessee and Missouri and met soybean and cotton farmers who told us they fear they could be the generation to lose the family farm. Since 1855 the West Tennessee State Fair has been the place where farmers from across the state come to show off their prized livestock and crops. It's where we met Jeffrey Daniels and Franklin Carmack. Friends since high school, they grow cotton, soybeans and corn on their family farms. Jeffrey Daniels: As far back as I've been able to trace, uh my great granddaddy's daddy was a sharecropper. And then it just got passed down through the generations. Cecilia Vega: I guess you could say you've got farming in your blood. Franklin Carmack: Yes. Jeffrey Daniels: Yes, ma'm. Franklin Carmack: And it's got to be in your blood nowadays to keep doing it. Instead of showing crops at the fair this year like other farmers, they are selling T-shirts made from the cotton they grow to offset their losses in the fields. They sold about 250 shirts — at $35 a piece, it was hardly enough. This year combined, they expect to lose nearly $800 thousand dollars. leaving them in the red like many farmers across the country. Major row crops, including corn, soybeans, cotton and wheat, have not been profitable since at least 2022. Jeffrey Daniels: You know, we're selling our commodities at the same price that we were selling them for and that our grandparents were selling them for in the 70s. So, you know, if you think about that, what can you go buy today that costs the same as it did in the 70s? Cecilia Vega: Nothing. Jeffrey Daniels: Nothing. Times are especially tough now because of what are called input costs — everything a farmer needs to pull income from the ground such as seed, equipment parts and fertilizer. Those costs have increased by more than 30% in the last five years, in part due to inflation and rising interest rates. Franklin Carmack: The morale in the farming industry, not just farmers, is the lowest I've ever seen. Everybody's on edge. In the first six months of 2025, there were 57% more farm bankruptcies than the same period last year. Daniels and Carmack say tariffs have made this year even harder. Jeffrey Daniels: Every time we go buy somethin' now, you know, the tariffs, what I've seen-- uh the tariffs pass down to the consumer. Cecilia Vega: So if you have to go buy a new sprayer like the one behind you. Jeffrey Daniels: Anything that comes from China that's on that sprayer, there's a tariff and they're just going to pass it directly to us. Cecilia Vega: So the tariffs are hitting you more on the purchasing end than they are on the crop sales end. China primarily uses soybeans to feed its massive livestock industry, grinding the beans into powder for feed. Soybeans have long been the largest U.S. export crop, worth nearly $25 billion last year, until sales ground to a halt this past May. It's not just the soybean market; cotton farmers have struggled with dwindling prices and decreased global demand as clothing manufacturers use more synthetic fabrics. Daniels and Carmack have had to take on second and third jobs, not just selling T-shirts, but driving trucks and repairing boats when they are not in their fields. Cecilia Vega: You've said you have almost no equity left. Jeffrey Daniels: It's getting down, It's getting, it's getting low. Cecilia Vega: You think you can make it another year? Jeffrey Daniels: I don't know. I don't know. Jeffrey Daniels: Do you just keep going, rolling the dice, hoping things will turn? I mean, it's not looking good. President Trump has promised a new bailout for American farmers, as much as $13 billion dollars that he said would be paid for by the tariffs. President Trump (at White House in September 2025): ""We're going to take some of that tariff money that we made, we're going to give it to our farmers who are, for a little while, going to be hurt until it kicks in, the tariffs kick in to their benefit."" Like most farmers we spoke to, Daniels and Carmack say they'd rather work their fields than rely on taxpayer money. Franklin Carmack: It will help pay some bills, but that's not fixing the problem. It's a band aid when we need stitches. Cecilia Vega: Can you wait? Franklin Carmack: No. Cecilia Vega: Can you wait this out? Franklin Carmack: Farm families can't wait. Cecilia Vega: I hear it's affecting your health. Franklin Carmack: Yes Franklin Carmack: Four blood pressure pills a day, three different medicines. Two years ago, none. Cecilia Vega: What do you think about when you go to bed at night? Franklin Carmack: Um, what's gonna be left in a year, two years? Am I the one that broke what started in the late 1800s. Nearly all U.S. farms are family owned. And farmers told us one of the greatest pressures they face today is maintaining that legacy, keeping their farms in the family in the face of mounting debts. We were surprised by how often our conversations turned to the issue of farmers taking their own lives, something that has plagued farming communities for generations. But farmers we spoke to told us concerns for their neighbors rise when crop sales drop. This video went viral in the agriculture community last year. Soybean farmer Alex Kerr showed a grim reality in Illinois, where he also sells used farm equipment. Alex Kerr (from viral video:): There are three tractors up here that I bought on auction–and I'm not going to tell you which ones-- but they came off of suicide. The reason that the farmers are no longer there. The reason that I've got the tractors. The suicide rate among agriculture workers is three times higher than the general working population, according to the CDC's most recent data in 2021. Our reporting shows that many rural mental health groups are now seeing increased crisis calls to their hotlines. Cecilia Vega: Do you feel like something's different right now? Jolie Foreman: I do. And-- and to put my finger on it, it's just-- it's really hard. But I know the numbers are going up. I know more people are affected. I know the prices of everything get higher and higher-- and the stresses are added to it. Jolie Foreman runs Shelby County Cares, a nonprofit focused on the high number of suicides among farmers. The organization is named after her eastern Missouri County, where there are no stop lights and one therapist for 6,000 people. Cecilia Vega: when you first started, you were seeing--how many people take their own lives? Jolie Foreman: So back in '22, if you calculated it out, it was averaging out to about a life every three months. And it was like, ""This has to stop."" Though it's difficult to know how many lives have been saved, Foreman believes her program is working. Jolie Foreman: Shelby County had the highest rate of suicide per capita in the state of Missouri. Cecilia Vega: Wow. Jolie Foreman: Suicide is so hard. We cannot really determine our success. We only can calculate the losses. But we do know-- that the numbers here f-- had started to trend down. Nut in neighboring Macon County, Missouri just a few miles away, there were two confirmed farm suicides this year. Jolie Foreman: Research shows that-- for every suicide, 130 people are affected. Cecilia Vega: Are you worried you could see an increase-- Jolie Foreman: Yes. Cecilia Vega: --because of the situation? Jolie Foreman: Yeah. And just knowing that the counties around us have had increased, you know, deaths by suicide that's I think why the communities cam together so well. Shelby County Cares connects farmers with therapists, either in person or remotely. Foreman said walk-ins and calls to her office have increased since the beginning of the year. She's learned the best way to get farmers, who are traditionally stoic and fiercely independent. to talk, is through their wives and their stomachs. Holly Klusmeyer: Today we're gonna make taco soup, and crock-pot ranch pork chops, and pulled barbecue chicken. Her way in is a regular gathering of farmers' wives and friends, where we met as they prepared meal kits. Cecilia Vega: How many of you have been touched by suicide in your lives or your communities? Several hands raise Cecilia Vega: Almost everybody at this table. Amanda Strange: They isolate. They bottle things up. they think they need to solve their own problems. And they're afraid to reach out. And they're afraid to lean on people. So they may feel that there's no other way or that somebody's gonna be better off without them. Jess Utterbrink: It's very much this perception of you have to be strong you have to be tough, you know, the weight of the world is ultimately on your shoulders. Cecilia Vega: Do you know farmers personally who have taken their own lives? Jolie Foreman: I do. I do. I mean, in my own family, we've definitely had tragedy and have lost some very, you know, important people in our own family. Since the 1970s, Jolie's father-in-law, Brent Foreman, has lost three relatives, all farmers, to suicide. Two neighbors of the family farm also recently took their own lives. Brent Foreman: I've always had a fear for my kids and-- now my grandkids that we sure don't want history to repeat itself. I you know, no matter how bad things get, things always have a way of workin' out. They-- they'll always get better. Brent and his son Jarrell grow more than 1,000 acres of soybeans and 650 acres of corn on a farm they manage themselves. They also raise more than 200 head of cattle, which means they are not reliant on soybeans as their sole source of income and can afford to wait for details on President Trump's new trade deal. Brent Foreman: I-- I have a lotta faith in him, and a lotta trust in him. And I think he's tryin' to make us the best deal he can for-- for the whole country, but for the American farmer, for-- for the long term. Nearly 80% of voters in what are called farming-dependent counties voted for President Trump in the last election. Jeffrey Daniels: I feel like a lot of American farmers, cattle people, it's a lot, a lot of people probably feel let down currently now. Maybe there's a method to the madness, you know, that's still to be seen. Many are now taking their frustrations directly to Republican lawmakers at townhalls across the country. This fall, the White House promised a $40 billion bailout of Argentina and its president, Javier Milei, President Trump's political ally. Argentina also grows soybeans and is considered a competitor. During the trade war, China had purchased soybeans from Argentina instead of buying them from the U.S. The bailout enraged many American farmers who felt betrayed. Cecilia Vega: President Trump said Argentina has got no money. They have no anything. They're fighting so hard to survive. Franklin Carmack: Come to the farm. Come walk in my shoes. Cecilia Vega: What would you show the president if he took you up on your offer to come and see the farm? Franklin Carmack: I'd show him the daily life that I do from cleaning equipment, running equipment, dispatching trucks. And then I'd hand him a stack of bills. And then I would show him the receipts, what I'm getting from my crop. He's a smart man. I'm not going to take that away from him. And it won't take him the five minutes to say, this isn't going to work.

"The High Court has been urged to make orders requiring Sky Ireland Ltd to end its practice of automatically renewing customers’ contracts without first informing them their contracts are about to end and of alternative tariffs. The Commission for Communications Regulation (Comreg) has brought proceedings claiming Sky is in breach of 2022 EU regulations requiring communications service providers to inform consumers in a prominent and timely manner of the end of the contractual commitment and means by which they can terminate the contract. It says Sky is also contravening the regulations by failing to provide consumers with “best tariff advice” before the contract is automatically prolonged. Sky is the only one of the five big providers refusing to do so, Comreg says. Comreg’s case was opened before Ms Justice Eileen Roberts on Tuesday by Eoin McCullough SC. Sky opposes the application. READ MORE It disputes Comreg’s interpretation of the relevant legal provisions and says they only apply to contracts with a fixed duration. Its customers’ contracts are subscription contracts of indeterminate duration, it says. The regulations, Sky argues, are designed to address the potential harm of consumers getting automatically prolonged in the contract for a second term without their knowledge. This harm does not arise in relation to Sky customers as its contracts do not follow this type of model in Ireland, it argues. The case continues and is scheduled to last three days.",left
"Will you get a $2,000 tariff dividend check? Here's the betting odds. Bettors on prediction betting sites such as Polymarket and Kalshi seem to be skeptical about the likelihood of $2,000 tariff dividend checks. President Donald Trump has floated the idea of sending $2,000 tariff dividend checks to Americans. Will it happen? You can place your bets. Bettors on prediction betting sites such as Polymarket and Kalshi seem to be skeptical. President Trump recently suggested the possibility of checks from tariff revenue. ""A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,"" he posted Nov. 9 on Truth Social. Three days later, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed the president's support for the dividends when asked about it on Nov. 12. ""The White House is committed to making that happen, yes, and we are currently exploring all legal options to get that done,"" she said. Trump broached the idea of a dividend rebate in July saying tariff revenue could lead to ""a little rebate but the big thing we want to do is pay down debt."" The $2,000 payments would be made ""to low and middle income USA Citizens,"" Trump said Nov. 10 on Truth Social. But taxpayers can be forgiven if they are skeptical of the checks arriving, as this isn't the first time Trump has suggested giving money to Americans. No checks arose from the president's consideration in February of stimulus checks funded by expected savings the cost-cutting efforts of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Here's what bettors on prediction platforms think about the likelihood of $2,000 tariff dividend checks. What does Polymarket think about the likelihood of tariff dividend checks? Activity on Polymarket as of Saturday, Nov. 15 suggests users are skeptical about dividend checks being sent to Americans. The site gives a 7% likelihood for President Trump creating a tariff dividend in 2025, with more than $950,000 in volume. Betting began on Oct. 3 and rose to 17% on Nov. 9, but has fallen since then. Trump, who had brought up the idea of a tariff dividend for Americans in August, also mentioned the potential dividend checks during an Oct. 2 interview with One America News Network (OAN). ""We've thinking maybe $1,000 to $2,000. It'd be great,"" he said. Polymarket also has another tariff dividend wager suggesting a likelihood of 26% for President Trump to create a tariff dividend by March 31, 2026. That outcome, with wagering initiated on Nov. 9, hit a high of 44% on Nov. 13. But the odds for Yes have fallen since then. Fewer folks are wagering on this outcome, as the volume has surpassed $19,620. Another wager, started on Nov. 13 and lacking enough activity to have a posted volume, poses the question of whether Americans will get tariff stimulus checks by December 31. The likelihood rested at 6% on Saturday, Nov. 15. Polymarket activity also suggests skepticism on how big the revenue boost will be from Trump's tariffs. An active wager on the site about whether the likelihood of tariffs will generating more than $250 billion in 2025 has fallen to 6% from a high of 35% in April, with a volume of more than $931,500. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies fiscal policy, has estimated tariff revenue of about $100 billion so far, falling short of the $600 billion needed for an initial round of tariff dividend checks. Non-profit think tank The Tax Foundation estimates that net revenue from Trump’s tariffs would equal about $216 billion in fiscal year 2026, which began Oct. 1. What does Kalshi think about the likelihood of tariff dividend checks? Skepticism also rules on Kalshi where users give a 5% chance of checks going out in 2025, on volume of more than $418,000, as of Saturday, Nov. 15. That's down from a high of 13.4% on Nov. 10, a day after betting began on Nov. 9. Action on Kalshi also seems to indicate users think the Supreme Court will strike down Trump's tariffs. The likelihood the court will rule in favor of Trump's tariffs was at 24% on Saturday, Nov. 15, on volume of more than $1.17 million. That's down from a high of 58% shortly after action began on Sept. 2. The Supreme Court heard arguments on Nov. 5 about whether Trump had the power to impose sweeping tariffs on imports rather than Congress. A majority of the justices sounded skeptical of the Trump administration’s arguments. 'Difficult to tell' Congress would have to approve the plan and it's uncertain there's enough revenue to make the dividend checks viable, said Scott Steinberg, geopolitical futurist and keynote speaker for FutureProof Strategies. ""It's hard to see how the administration would be able to make the math work in practice without putting more parameters on the checks, or how such a windfall for private citizens would leave enough revenue to pay down national debt as the plan is currently envisioned,"" he told USA TODAY. ""I’m sure many citizens would love to ease their financial burdens, especially around the holidays and gift giving season, and see money going back in their pockets for once this year instead of the other way around,"" Steinberg said. ""Still, it’s difficult to tell at this point if there’s a workable way to execute on the concept, especially as initially sketched out – and if we’ll really seen a tangible return in our wallets on overarching policy decisions.""

And this week on Face the Nation: the longest government shutdown in history, and no end in sight. With each passing day, the impact of the government shutdown grows, with millions of Americans now facing major disruptions, from mass flight cancellations and delays because of staffing shortages to growing lines at food banks, as the Supreme Court lets the Trump administration withhold some money to fund food stamp benefits. Frustration is mounting, and the blame game is on. (Begin VT) GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO (D-Pennsylvania): When I see hungry people in my state who are hungry because of J.D. Vance's bull (EXPLETIVE DELETED) politics, that makes me angry. SENATOR JOHN THUNE (R-South Dakota): Isn't that what you all have been saying? It's about leverage? This isn't leverage. This is the lives of the American people. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with Maryland's Democratic Governor Wes Moore and West Virginia's Republican Governor Patrick Morrisey about how they could fill the funding gap as safety net programs hang in limbo. The president's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, will also join us. We will ask him what kind of impact this shutdown is having on our economy. Plus: (Begin VT) DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): The whole series of pricing and costs, the groceries and everything else, it was a con job. It was a con job. Affordability, they call it. It was a con job by the Democrats. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Where the president sees a con job, Democrats see a winning message in last week's elections. We will hear from two incoming governors, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. The Senate is in session today, a rare weekend workday for lawmakers, but there is still no deal to reopen the government. We begin this morning with the director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. This is now the longest shutdown in American history. The treasury secretary told us two weeks ago November 15 was the hard stop for any paychecks going to U.S. troops. Does that remain the point of exhaustion? KEVIN HASSETT (Director, National Economic Council): Right. I think that that's about the right number. And the problem is that, under the law, we're not allowed to spend money that hasn't been appropriated. And there is a law, the Antideficiency Act, that says that, if a government official spends money that isn't appropriated by Congress, which will only happen if the Democrats vote to open up the government, then you could even have criminal penalties. And so people are very carefully studying the law and trying to get as much money out the door as is legal. And we're very glad that we found a way to get a lot of the SNAP money out, but it's really, really pushing the boundaries of the law, which is why the Supreme Court had to take that ruling from Rhode Island and put it on hold. MARGARET BRENNAN: Until the lower court rules. KEVIN HASSETT: Until the lower court goes back and comes up with a legal justification for what they said, because there probably isn't one, sadly, which is why we have to get this government open. I mean, the fact is, Goldman Sachs, they have a top economic team, and they're estimating that we've already knocked about 1.5 percent off of GDP. I think that number is probably low if we keep going even a couple more weeks, because there's going to be a massive amount of air disruption, especially around the holidays. And one of these things – every now and then, when we're talking economics, you and I, we talk about seasonal adjustments and things like that. But the fact is that Thanksgiving – that Thanksgiving time is one of the hottest times of the year for the economy. It's Black Friday, you know, and all that kind of stuff. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. KEVIN HASSETT: And if people aren't traveling at that moment, then we really could be looking at a negative quarter for the fourth quarter. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is significantly disruptive to the president's agenda. But to the point you were just making about food stamps – and we saw this Friday, a temporary stay by the Supreme Court that would block full food stamp benefits pending the lower court decision. The administration's argument, as you just referenced there, was that it would be illegal to move around funding and to tap the Section 32 account at the USDA. But why not do this as a short-term patchwork solution? Because you have found ways with the military pay to stretch things out. Why prioritize in that case and not do so with food? KEVIN HASSETT: Well, the president's job and all of our jobs is to uphold the law. And when – I'm not a lawyer, but when the lawyers tell us… MARGARET BRENNAN: But, arguably… KEVIN HASSETT: … what we can do… MARGARET BRENNAN: … that wasn't done with the military. KEVIN HASSETT: But – but – but, yes, I think that the military is different because of the commander in chief stuff. But the legal analysis suggests that we're doing everything by the book and then stretching things as much as we can, and basically trying to keep people from committing crimes, which, you know, you know about – in the season of lawfare, if you are a Cabinet secretary and you spend money that's not appropriated for that purpose in your Cabinet, then they can come back and they can take you to court. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're also making a political bet that Democrats aren't going to challenge paying the military. Do you really think Democrats would challenge and take to court paying people for their food stamp benefits… KEVIN HASSETT: Let's just say that we've seen Democrats take… MARGARET BRENNAN: … if – if Congress is going to fund it, when the shutdown ends? KEVIN HASSETT: We've seen Democrats take to court people that – on really, really poor, poor charges, and so I think they're likely to do anything. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it seems a political calculation is the point. KEVIN HASSETT: Well, we – we don't have a political calculation. Our calculation is to get the government open, to get the food stamps to people, and to get people to be paid; 750,000 government workers aren't getting paid right now. I know you're talking to the governor of Maryland in a minute. I'm sure his people are really hurting. Let's just get the government open, and then let's talk about things like the health care premiums, but do that through regular order. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well – so, it sounds like you are saying the position is the same, open the government, then we'll talk about health care. But the president, just in the past 36 hours, has put out a number of social media posts. It sounds sort of like he's proposing something in regard to health insurance payments. He said: ""I'm recommending to Senate Republicans that hundreds of billions of dollars currently being sent to money-sucking insurance companies to save bad health care provided by Obamacare now be sent to the people so they can purchase their own, much better health care."" He also said they should terminate Obamacare. What does this alternative system look like? Because the entire standoff is about health care right now. KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, the president is, you know, a beautiful tactician, a beautiful negotiator. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is an offer? KEVIN HASSETT: And what he – this is – you know, what he said, he's brainstorming and trying to help the Senate come up with a deal that can get the government open. And one of the things you could do is, conservatives believe that they don't want the government to micromanage people's lives. And, you know, everybody believes that people should have health care, and so why not take the people who have higher health care premiums and just mail them a check and let them decide? The reason why it could have an effect is that there are multiple tiers under the Affordable Care Act of different types of insurance. And it could be that people would rather have the money and go from, like, you know, this kind of plan to that kind of plan and save themselves a little bit. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the… KEVIN HASSETT: And so that's – that's, you know, basically giving the people an opportunity to make more choices than the government usually lets them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the Senator Cassidy proposal? KEVIN HASSETT: I'm sure that Senator Cassidy and President Trump talked about it, but whether he agrees with everything that Cassidy – I haven't talked to him about it yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, does the Republican leader in the Senate accept… KEVIN HASSETT: The president… MARGARET BRENNAN: … this proposal? KEVIN HASSETT: The president has – started this idea yesterday. I don't think that it's been discussed widely in the Senate yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president… KEVIN HASSETT: It's the weekend. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senate's in session this weekend. KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, the Senate is in session this weekend. And we are… MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they're trying to end the shutdown. KEVIN HASSETT: And here I am. MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is not the Republican Party's position? KEVIN HASSETT: Current – as of right now, it's not the Senate position, but the president thought it was something they should think about. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he seems to be negotiating before the government's open. KEVIN HASSETT: He's talking to his colleagues in the Senate on the Republican side. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would agree that there does need to be a deal on health care, that health care costs are too high? KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I think that, if you look at the Affordable Care Act, these premiums weren't made permanent by the Democrats during the COVID emergency because they were worried about the budgetary costs. And so if you look at the premium increases, they don't affect most people below two times the poverty line, three times the poverty line. But there are a lot of senior citizens that are above, like, around four times the poverty level, which with a husband and wife team, would be about $120,000, that are seeing really big premium increases. And I think that everybody's going to want to think about what the next step for that would be, because are seeing – again, most people aren't seeing much of an increase at all, but the maximum increases you're seeing could be up to about $500 a month for seniors who have really costly plans. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has also been talking about affordability. And our CBS polling shows the president's approval rating on the economy has dipped to 38 percent, the lowest of this term; 75 percent of those polled say he's not focusing enough on lowering prices. But the president said this week Democrats are making it up and – quote – ""Every price is down."" I'm sure you know the Consumer Price Index showed grocery prices are up nearly 3 percent in September from a year ago. KEVIN HASSETT: Well, but let's go through – let's go through the facts. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you dispute that? KEVIN HASSETT: Well, let – actually, yes, let's go through the facts, right? So, inflation went up about 5 percent under President Biden. In President Trump's first eight or nine months, depending where we get the last number, it's up 2.7 percent. One of the big things that's hurting affordability is mortgages. The interest rate went up by about 4 percent. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is grocery prices. KEVIN HASSETT: No, grocery prices are actually down significantly under Trump. But here's the thing… MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it depends on which item. KEVIN HASSETT: No, let me – I will just make a point, that if you look at the real reduction in spending power for Americans under Joe Biden, then it went down about $3,000, because we had up to 9 percent inflation, and then they went to the grocery store, they couldn't buy the things they're used to buying. The real spending power adjusted for inflation under President Trump has gone up about $1,200 so far this year; $1,200 is not $3,000. And so people are right to feel stretched, but we're making progress. And if you look at all the things, the positive things, about the economy, industrial production just about at an all-time high, capital spending about at an all-time high… MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. KEVIN HASSETT: … GDP growth right now about 4 percent, then that shows that the income growth that we need to get more affordability is on the path to happening. And the bottom line is that the last Consumer Price Index surprised down. It was lower than expected. And it was actually – would have been even lower, because there was a refinery shutdown that caused it to go slightly higher. So we see inflation under control and the economy booming. But we understand 100 percent why people are still hurting, because we haven't made up all the room that was lost under Joe Biden. MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you comfortable with 3 percent inflation? KEVIN HASSETT: I'm comfortable with 2 percent inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no, you're not happy where things are now? KEVIN HASSETT: I think – well, they have got to go down a little bit more, but there – but the point is that inflation is like the Queen Mary, my friend Alan Greenspan used to say. So when you go from almost 4 percent that we had in January… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. KEVIN HASSETT: … down to the mid 2's, then that's a trajectory that usually has momentum. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the St. Louis Fed found tariffs account for half-a- percentage point of the annual inflation rate. How much do you think the tariffs are hiking prices? KEVIN HASSETT: You know, there's a couple of papers out there that say that prices went up by between two-tenths and five-tenths. And the thing to remember, if those papers are true, is that that's a level adjust, because the tariff goes in, and then the tariff is just there, so it doesn't affect inflation in the future. So, it would be a one-time level adjust. Our estimates at CEA are much closer to zero, and it's all based on modeling and assumptions about elasticities and things. But for the most part, the one way you can see it is, you could look at the price of imported goods, and the price of imported goods, CEA put a report out, has actually been declining under tariffs, because what happens is that the Chinese want to sell us lots of stuff. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. KEVIN HASSETT: And there's a tariff, and so they cut their prices so that they can still have a larger market share in the U.S. MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, always good to have you here in person. KEVIN HASSETT: Great to be here, of course. Thanks. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there for now. We'll be right back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore. Good to have you here in person. GOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-Maryland): Great to be with you. Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Governor, one in eight Americans use food stamps. In Maryland, you have about 700,000 people, as I understand it, who rely on this for food aid. Since the Supreme Court put that stay in place on Friday, do you know whether that money will actually be available to residents in your state to buy food? GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We don't know, and that's why we're not waiting. It is why, just in the past few days, I have authorized over $10 million that's going towards heating assistance for people in the state of Maryland. Over $10 million has gone to our Maryland food banks, that we have made public transportation free for all of our federal workers, because they, in many cases, are going to work and not being paid. And I have also authorized $62 million to go towards SNAP to make sure that SNAP is not going to be interrupted for the people of Maryland for as long as we can, despite the fact that we are waiting for the president of the United States to finally do his job. We are watching the president who is literally breaking the law so people can starve, but we're not going to sit there and tolerate in our state. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you just heard Director Hassett say that they are trying to follow the law, which is why they went to the courts. The USDA did say they were going to work towards implementing full payments, and then there was this Supreme Court stay put in place. So, do you have clarity on when money might be coming through at all? Like, what's the federal government telling you? GOVERNOR WES MOORE: There is no clarity – clarity at all. In the past – in the past six days, we've received four different measures of guidance from the USDA and from the Trump administration about how to handle it, where, initially, it was said, well, listen, we want the states to help to support, and despite the fact that this program was built as a partnership between the federal government and the states, where the federal government were really helping to underwrite these costs for people. And then once we decided to step up and say, we are going to make sure that our people are going to be OK, we have now… MARGARET BRENNAN: You are fronting the money? (CROSSTALK) GOVERNOR WES MOORE: That we are going to front the money. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We've now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money. There is a chaos, and it is an intentional chaos, that we are seeing from this administration, and where they have money for everything. They got money to fight wars. They got money for ballrooms. They got money for everything. But when it comes to supporting the American people, that's now when they are crying, well, we're broke, and that's not what the law requires us to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, the White House says those – those sponsorships for the ballroom are separate from government money. GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: But on – on the issue, though, of the shutdown itself, on Friday, we did see the Democratic leader, Schumer, offer to end it if Republicans agree to a one-year extension of the Obamacare health care subsidies. Republicans said that's a – that's a nonstarter. This is going to make – this is a big issue for the midterms. But would you – would you tell the Democrats on Capitol Hill to dig in, that the pain that the people who are living in your state is somehow going to be worth it in the end for an extension of a tax credit? GOVERNOR WES MOORE: There is no pain that is worth it. Our people are hurting, and they're hurting because of these games that we continue to see from Washington, D.C. MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you tell Democrats, just take the vote, open the government, then keep negotiating health care? GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I want the government reopened now. There is no state that is dealing with more of an impact from this than the state of Maryland. We have over 260,000 federal workers within our state, that, even before the shutdown, Donald Trump had fired over 15,000 Maryland workers, federal workers, more than any other state in this country. But I also know that saying that a prerequisite for having the federal government open shouldn't be kicking up premiums by 90 percent, by kicking people off of health care. There's a bar – there's a – there's a – there's a barbaric nature to this ask and this request, particularly when we're watching how the Trump – you know, the Trump administration, they have the White House, the House and the Senate. They can get this deal done by just simply making a phone call, but they're allowing this pain to exist. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats also have a promise from the Republican leader in the Senate that he'll talk about health care if they reopen the government. Why isn't that good enough? GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Why – why… MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you tell your members of the Democratic Party to - - to relieve the pain in the immediate term from your state? GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I would tell them that we need to ensure that reopening the government does not mean kicking my people off of health care, that when we're spending time right now over in Western Maryland and Appalachia – and I'm proud to serve as the as the – as a co-chair of the Appalachian Regional – Regional Commission, where we're serving Appalachia, all throughout not just Maryland, but throughout West Virginia, throughout Tennessee and Pennsylvania. And when we're speaking to our folks out there who are already watching their premiums jump, who are already watching everything become more expensive because of these policies, I don't think that anybody, whether in Western Maryland or any part of my state, would say, yes, it's OK, if you just watch my health care go away. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, health care prices are going up even in the private market for a lot of different reasons. GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: But let me ask you about what's happening in Maryland. This past Tuesday, out in California, we saw this Proposition 50; 64 percent of California voters came out in support of what Gavin Newsom put out there with redistricting. This would allow him to charge ahead with plans to potentially gain an additional five Democratic congressional seats. This is gerrymandering. You are looking at midterm redistricting in your state as well. Of eight districts, you only have one Republican. Do you really think Maryland is drawn in an unfair way right now? GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think that the reason that I ordered the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission is because I want to make sure that we can have a bipartisan group being able to look at the maps in the state of Maryland. This is something that happens every single… MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think these maps are fair now? GOVERNOR WES MOORE: This is something that happens every single decade. And if other states are going to have this process and go through this – go through this journey of identifying whether or not they have fair maps in a mid-decade cycle, then so should Maryland. I'm just not sure why we should be playing by a different set of rules than Texas or than Florida or than Ohio or all these other places. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you say those states are being unfair. So why adopt unfair policies in your state? GOVERNOR WES MOORE: This is just simply about making sure that we can have fair and representative maps and we can go through our process. It's the reason that I have – I put together this commission, where my job is not to draw the maps, that what we've just simply said is, I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that, if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to, that that's not the way this process is going to work. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your State Senate president, Democrat Bill Ferguson, says this could backfire. He wrote: ""I believe mid-cycle redistricting twist rules for potential short-term advantage while undermining trust in institutions and ultimately democracy. It's too risky and jeopardizes your state's ability to fight against the radical Trump administration."" How do you make sure it doesn't backfire? Do you accept a map that gives you more Republican districts? You're not going to do that. GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think fighting for democracy is never risky. I think that's our job as leaders and elected officials. And… MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're not committing to going with the outcome of what this commission provides to you? GOVERNOR WES MOORE: No, I think the commission – what I want is for the commission to do their work and the commission to do their job. My job is not to draw the maps. And, frankly, it's the state legislature's job to decide to vote on it. That is not my responsibility. My job is to make sure that I'm protecting the democratic process. And the Senate president and I, we agree on the crisis that Donald Trump has put us in. He agrees on the fact that we have watched an administration that's using the Constitution like it's a suggestion box. But what I'm simply – and where we – where we differ is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires. And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy? MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Moore, thank you for your time this morning. GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you so much. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Democratic governor-elect of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger. She joins us this morning from Glen Allen, just outside of Richmond. Welcome to Face the Nation. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-Virginia) (Governor-Elect): Thank you so much for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Virginia boasts one of the highest numbers of federal workers in the country, and, as you know, many of them are not getting paid. You know, some in your party look at your election on Tuesday and the win in New Jersey and say that is permission to hold the line in Congress and refuse to fund the government or fold on the shutdown. Should congressional Democrats view your victory that way? GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Absolutely not. Our victory was a victory that was based on a campaign that was addressing concerns related to costs and chaos. My campaign across the past two years had been focused on hearing the challenges that people are facing all across Virginia. It's rising costs in health care, housing, energy, and it's the chaos coming out of Washington that has been impacting Virginians so severely, beginning with the DOGE efforts, of course, continuing with chaotic trade policies, and now in this government shutdown. Virginians need to and Virginians want to see the government reopen. And my expectation is that we will see a Congress, a Senate, and ultimately a president, driving us in that direction. MARGARET BRENNAN: But should congressional Democrats open the government and then talk about health care? GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: The government needs to open, and it needs to open immediately. We need the president to demonstrate leadership, bringing people together, endeavoring to get through whatever negotiations need to get through, whether it's before or after. My priority is the – is focusing on the needs and the – the devastation, frankly… MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: … that more than 300,000 Virginians are facing. And that's just the federal employees, government contractors. They will never get made whole. The entirety of Virginia's economy is impacted by the shutdown, just as we've been impacted by DOGE attacks, and the government needs to reopen quickly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why I'm asking, because there are, what, 825,000 enrollees on food aid in the SNAP program. They're in limbo right now. GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have immediate pain. So, at what point do you weigh that against the potential of health care premiums? I mean, this pain is very real and very acute for people in your state right now. GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: And it's been going on now for weeks, weeks too long. The government needs to reopen because, in addition to the pain that we are already seeing federal employees and government contractors facing…. MARGARET BRENNAN: But eight Democrats could cross the aisle and do so. GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: We absolutely need everyone to vote to open the government. And that's not to say that the challenges we're facing within our health care system are not also immediate and acute. Even the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill will have catastrophic impacts on Virginia, taking $26 billion out of our health care, leading to the closure of at least six rural hospitals. We've already seen three rural clinics announce their closure. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Hundreds of thousands will lose their Medicaid. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me… GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: And so the impacts on health care are already catastrophic. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to… GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: But we cannot compound that pain by keeping the government closed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's take a break and finish this on the other side of it. Please stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to ""FACE THE NATION."" We return to our conversation with Virginia Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger. Governor-elect, artificial intelligence has created a really big demand for these data centers. And Virginia has the world's largest concentration of them. Power bills are up nearly seven percent in your state over the past year. Is that driven by the A.I. boom? And, if so, how do you offset those rising energy costs? GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-VA): Well, what we've seen in the – in the research so far is that it is not – the increase costs are not driven by the increase in data centers. There's, you know, some bad energy policies in some of our neighboring states that have driven up prices, particularly in southwest Virginia. But looking towards the future, we have to be clear-eyed about the fact that we will have an energy crisis headed into the future. And so here, on the ground in Virginia, we currently have a rate (ph) case where it will be important that large-scale energy users, particularly data centers, that the public know that they are paying their fair share for the energy that they are using. And we have to increase our energy production here at home so that we can meet the demand certainly of larger-scale energy users but also of increased demand from our communities. And it is a real challenge that we have to get ahead of. And that's why among the first affordability plans that I laid out was one focused on energy. It's a challenge that is pervasive across our communities, and particularly acute in southwest Virginia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just a few days ago Cornell University reached a $60 million deal with the Trump administration in order to see their federal funding restored. This is the fifth such deal since the administration began this pressure campaign on universities. I know you went to University of Virginia, as did I, and must be following that UVA cut deals with the government, including kicking out the president of the school. You called that extortion. But now, as governor, are you going to have to play ball with the Department of Education and the Justice Department in order to keep federal government funding going? GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: So, it should – it should shock everyone that universities, public and private, are receiving demands from the federal government and that dollars – research dollars are being withheld, that our universities are under attack. And certainly what we've seen in the case of the University of Virginia, of a popular, experienced, excellent president, was pushed out. And on the ground here we did not see our governor, in any way, step up in defense of our university. And the idea that the federal government would be withholding federal dollars, you know, including dollars already appropriated by Congress for research in order to compel universities to take certain actions, it is absolute federal government overreach. And as governor, I will be clear- eyed about ensuring that we have structures in place, including boards of visitors across our universities, that want to defend academic freedom and, frankly, the viability and vitality of extraordinary institutions, like the University of Virginia. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your party. In 2020, when Democrats lost House seats, you said ""we need to not ever use the word socialist or socialism ever again."" There are some who look to Tuesday's win in New York City of a Democratic socialist and say that your party's actually being rewarded for echoing progressive policies. Does that victory create a branding problem for Democrats? GOVERNOR-ELECT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Well, certainly, you know, I'm excited about what we did here in Virginia on Tuesday in – I campaigned addressing – wanting to address the issues of costs and stopping the chaos. I'm a capitalist. I'm a Democrat. And I won by 15 points in Virginia. You look to New Jersey, and a similar story in Mikie Sherrill's win, now the governor- elect there. And so I think, you know, certainly we're a big tent party, but when I look at what led to the success that we had here and the – you know, the mandate for real governance here in the Commonwealth of Virginia, it was based on what I campaigned on, the efforts to really address the challenges that people are facing in a day-to-day basis. And – and now it's on us to deliver and prove that really truly the mandate that we have to work on lowering costs and strengthening our schools and keeping our communities safe and creating steady leadership here in the Commonwealth of Virginia particularly in light of the chaos coming out of Washington, that not only was it a winning message, but the winning path towards governance. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for your time this morning, Governor- elect Abigail Spanberger, the – who will be the first female governor ever of the state of Virginia. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, we spoke with one of the other big Democratic winners last Tuesday, New Jersey's Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who is currently a member of Congress, and asked whether given her new role as the chief executive of a state hard hit by the shutdown she would support the Democratic Party position of blocking government funding until Obamacare subsidies are extended. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL (D-NJ): Well, it's really important that we keep up that fight because we see in the market costs going up by 175 percent if the Republicans don't address this health care crisis. We know that there have already been huge cuts in the one big, beautiful bill to people's access to health care. And, you know, when we look at this crisis, so much of it is really imposed by Donald Trump. So, there is money for him to put towards SNAP funding that he's refusing to do, even though courts are demanding it. Now he's kind of slow walking it, making it very difficult for states to do that illegally. And courts are holding him accountable. We see with air traffic control problems, some of this is because the administration hasn't moved quickly enough at Newark in some of the problems we had over the summer. So, we're already down by 25 percent. Now, with this crisis going on, because the president refuses to open up the government, we're seeing another 10 percent in flights being derailed, and we see continued late and delayed flights. So, it's time that the government – that the Trump administration, that Republicans in the House and the Senate get serious about opening up government. MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at our recent polling, a majority of Americans are really concerned that this shutdown is going to hurt the overall economy. How can you justify the damage? GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Well, it truly is hurting the economy. And you can't justify the damage, which is why the president and the Senate and Republican majority in the House need to get this government open. And they need to do so in a way that's going to stop punishing the American people. I think what we saw with this election is the American people need – you know, are really demanding that our federal government operate in a way that is going to stop punishing them economically. I'll tell you, I ran on affordability, on the fact that I'm going to fight in Trenton to make sure we're cutting through red tape and permitting to drive down costs. But also that I'm going to continue to fight that – for Washington to address things like the tariff program, which is raising costs on everything from a cup of coffee to groceries, to fight the one big beautiful bill, which is continuing to raise costs on education, innovation, housing, health care, to continue to fight this government shutdown so that we can really address health care needs here in the state. MARGARET BRENNAN: You keep saying it's up to the president to reopen the government, but you withheld your own vote on that continuing resolution, that short-term funding bill. And over in the Senate, Leader Thune is tearing into Democrats for that decision. He said, ""it shows you're not caring that there are men and women in uniform frequenting food banks because of the shutdown, not making represent payments, trying to borrow."" He said Dems view this as leverage. And he used that word because it was your House leadership, Katherine Clark, justified withholding votes to end the shutdown, saying, that's one of the few parts of leverage that Democrats have. How do you respond to this accusation that it's actually Democrats who are being heartless here? GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Well, when you have the Republicans that have the presidency, they have the majority in the Senate, they have the majority in the House, they've even – many would day, including myself, taken over the court system, then they have a responsibility to open up this government. And I have to tell you, as a veteran myself, I know how devastating that is. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it was – it was with Clark who said those votes are leverage. GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Leverage to serve the American people. I mean we see again and again these Republican attacks on everything from health care – look, if they don't fund the Affordable Care Act, costs are going to go up by 175 percent for people here in New Jersey at already high levels. That is going to kick so many people off health care. That's on top of the huge Medicare cuts that we're seeing in the one big beautiful bill, on top of the tariff cuts that are raising grocery prices everywhere, on top of the fight he's in, which is raising gas prices. So, again and again, we're seeing the Trump administration punishing people. And these Republicans have got to come to the table and they've got to start really working for the American people. And this election showed that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you were talking about the extension of the health care subsidies, why isn't the promise to hold a vote on those health care subsidies enough for Democrats to vote to reopen the government? GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: So, we are working hard to address the concerns for the American people. And Republicans again and again are refusing to address that. So, right now this is part of how we get the government open. And they should do it right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the – Leader Thune said he'll hold a vote. GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: I think we have seen what the promises that Republicans have made have been worth. What he needs to do is actually put the subsidies in. We can serve the American people. We can drive down health care costs. And that's really key. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk a bit about your election. As you said, the economy was front and center for you. Energy prices in particular you focused in on. In New Jersey, they're up 19 percent over the past year versus six percent nationwide. I know you want to declare a state of emergency day one, but what does it actually mean? How quickly will prices come down? GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: So, the state of emergency will freeze rate hikes because there are some rate hikes that are set to come into play in the next several months. And I, you know, I'm not going to allow those to be put on the back of the New Jersey rate pair. And we see that the can has been kicked down the road by too many people. So, the utility companies have already come to the table so say, OK, let's negotiate those rate hikes. We have money that comes in through the BP (ph) view (ph) to defray the costs. But what's really going to also happen is very quickly I'm turning to adding a lot of power to our grid. Right now, PJM, that's our regional grid operator, has really screwed up the market for various reasons and so every electron we produce in New Jersey will defray the costs of electricity we have to buy on the market. So, that's why immediately I'm going to cut through red tape and permitting delays to get solar done. We're going to continue to build out battery storage. And then, in the first budget, we will expand modernization of our natural gas facilities and, in the long term, nuclear. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said on CNN this past week that ""there's a feeling working people have not been heard"" and that ""there's too much caution and mediocrity in the Democratic Party today."" What did you mean by that? GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: That as I was talking to people across this state, thousands of people, they wanted to see an agenda to get their costs down. And something that was going to take place quickly. As I said, you know, I'm not writing a strongly worded letter, I'm not doing a ten-year plan, I'm on day one declaring a state of emergency. Not just because I'm furious that, you know, as too many people have failed New Jersey rate payers, that costs are being dumped on them. Yes, that is a huge problem for me that I'm addressing. But it also, I think, conveys that sense of urgency that I feel to work for the people of New Jersey so that they know that this is a day one issue for me. They also want to see somebody, though, that has their backs because they know that these tariffs are raising costs. They know that the one big, beautiful bill is going to take away their health care. They know that a tax on the Gateway Tunnel project are going to raise costs here and really cut into job opportunities. So, they want to know that whoever is governing is going to be focused on governing for them, not a party of one like Donald Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your criticism there was of fellow Democrats, as I understood it. But let me ask you about Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi. She just announced that she is going to be leaving Congress. When I spoke to her last on this program, she indicated that she knows it's a problem recruiting new candidates, in part because of the environment we're in, including just how nasty our politics are and the security threats. And she said that's discouraging in particular women who fear the impact on children. What do you say to those considering for office right now? Are you seeing that, that female candidates are fearful of doing what you just did? GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: Well, we worked very hard here in New Jersey to really build out a future and an idea that's going to bring everybody in and really working hard to keep people safe. Public safety is a huge somehow for me and for people across the state as we double down on our constitutional protections, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, et cetera. But it is a scary time. I remember, right after I won my primary, the assassinations in Minnesota took place. And here I have four kids and I'm suddenly thinking, oh my gosh, am I putting them at risk by running? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR-ELECT MIKIE SHERRILL: But, you know, what I think most of us are weighing is, as moms, if we're candidates is, what is my kids' future look like if I don't run? And that's on balance, I think, people are choosing to run. I see women across our state running. We have, you know, people newly getting into races and also some of the great powerful women in our state continuing to serve. So, I don't think it's dissuading them. But it certainly is on our minds as we are thinking about, how are we going to keep our families safe as we are running for elected office. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Congresswoman, we'll be watching as you transition into being the next governor of New Jersey. Thank you for your time today. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Republican governor of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who joins us from Charleston. Good morning to you, sir. GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY (R-WV): Hey, good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country, nearly 16 percent of residents rely on food stamps, that SNAP program we've been talking about. In fact, the very first food stamp pilot program began in West Virginia back in the 1960s. Given the current shutdown and how rural your state is, I wonder, are you able to get help to those who need it right now? GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Absolutely. Look, great question. I do want to start out, first of all, thanking you for having me on the program. One piece of information coming out of West Virginia, we've had a mining accident, and we have teams down looking for a missing miner. I just want to say, that our hearts and prayers go out to the family of that miner. We're doing everything we can to locate that person. Now, when it comes to the government shutdown, we're doing everything we can to help those in need. At the very beginning, I started standing up for the federal workers, and we announced that to address some of the concerns with food, we were going to send significant dollars to the food banks by tomorrow. That will be up to $13 million. I've activated the National Guard. And we're doing things to make sure that no one in West Virginia goes hungry. Our people are hurting right now, and I'm doing everything I can to solve the problems while Washington bickers. But I do want to be clear, this shutdown could come to an end right away. It's up to Chuck Schumer or just having six more Democrats step across the line. There's been a clean CR on the table available for some time. People should take advantage of that and let's get the government reopened and then we can go about the business of fixing the many other problems facing our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. I'm sorry to hear about the mining accident. But on the issue of food stamps, Governor Moore of Maryland said that he had been told the state would be punished essentially for fronting the money. Is that the message the federal government also gave to you, West Virginia won't get those dollars back? GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: No. Well, first of all, I want to emphasize, the Trump administration has been a great partner to work with throughout the past year in terms of the economic progress that we're making here in West Virginia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: But also we've reached out – I was the first person to reach out to the federal government. So we had our national parks reopened. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: And now we're working, by activating the Guard, and putting resources at the food banks. We're actually making a difference to keep people from getting hungry. So, we've been in very close contact with the Trump administration. And they've been very cooperative. Look, I think they know, and everyone's frustrated, that you're six votes short. These Democrats are saying no to reopening the government. It's a Schumer shutdown. I think President Trump is bending over backwards to be helpful, and I'm excited about the things he's doing in terms of how he's handling this and the broader economic issues at large. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there is the fight in the courts specifically about providing full food aid. The Trump administration initiated that. I want to play something for you because 70 percent of West Virginians voted for President Trump in the last election. GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But here's how he described the food stamp program. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (President of the United States): Largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm president. I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you're talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people. (END VIDEO CLIP) MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you made the White House aware of the pain from the food SNAP – the food program disruptions specifically? GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Yes. So, we've been working closely with the White House. And I think they know. They've been very supportive of a lot of the efforts that we're taking to make sure that people don't get hungry. That's the ultimate goal. We have to make sure we're protecting our people. Margaret, you're right, we have 270,000 plus people on SNAP. But, once again, there's one reason why they're not getting the resources. It's because people are insisting to add all these new pieces on top of just a bill (ph) to keep the government open. That's the concern we have. But we've been getting really good response from the Trump administration across the board. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Whether we're talking about the food issues, whether we're talking about our energy jobs or even just recently the conversations we're having about President Trump's rural health transformation bill to put resources upfront to save public expenditures at the back end. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that. GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: That's the kind of good working relationship we've had. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that because I know West Virginia has one of the highest rates in the country for government insurance. There's concern about rural hospitals. There is this rural health transformation program Congress set up. Your state could get $100 million a year for five years, but your West Virginia Hospital Association says that your hospitals are going to lose more than $1 billion per year because of this latest big, beautiful bill Republicans passed. How do you make up that kind of shortfall? GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Well, I think what President Trump and RFK and Dr. Oz are trying to do is common sense. If you subscribe to the adage, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, what they're trying to do is invest the single largest amount of money in improving rural health. And in West Virginia, that means everything because we're a very rural state. So, the resources can go to invest in our people, to invest in our hospitals, our providers, and the technology that actually could move the needle in terms of improving health care outcomes upfront. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Attacking obesity and COPD and substance use disorder. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: So, we're really excited about that because if we apply the resources the right way, I don't think we're going to have the diminution of public expenditures at the back end. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: This is the common-sense approach we're seeing from the Trump administration that we're not seeing from Schumer and the Democrats in Congress. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. All right. Governor, we have to leave it there. We are out of time. Thank you. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States Marine Corps will mark its 250th birthday tomorrow. And Veterans Day is Tuesday. For many veterans, the end of their military service is not the end of their public service. More than 700,000 veterans work as civilians in the federal government. And due to the shutdown, most are furloughed or have been working without pay for weeks. Unlike veterans, active-duty service members have been getting paid during the shutdown, but even that lifeline will expire Saturday. And some context, many military families already struggle with a growing number forced to seek assistance from food pantries over the last few years amid high prices and mounting economic pressure. That's it for us today. Thank you for watching.",left
"Trump's sweeping tariffs met with skepticism by Supreme Court justices Washington — A divided Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared skeptical of President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on nearly every country under a federal emergency powers law, as the justices tested a centerpiece of his economic agenda and the limits of presidential powers. The dispute over Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs marks the first in which the Supreme Court weighed the legal merits of one of the president's signature policies implemented in his second term. Arguments spanned nearly three hours, with the justices asking probing questions of lawyers for the Trump administration and a group of small businesses challenging the legality of the president's tariffs. But several of the justices appeared uncomfortable with the breadth of power Mr. Trump is asserting without Congress clearly authorizing him to levy broad tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner. Several justices noted that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as IEEPA, which the president has relied on to impose the duties, does not mention the word ""tariff,"" and has never before been used by a president to justify the levies, until now. The Trump administration has argued that the phrase ""regulate ... importation"" in the law gives the president authority to set import taxes. But Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer to identity any other provision of the U.S. code where the phrase ""regulate ... importation"" has been used to confer an authority to impose tariffs, while Chief Justice John Roberts said that Mr. Trump is claiming ""major authority"" to levy duties on any product from any country at any rate for any length of time. ""The statute doesn't use the word tariffs,"" Roberts said, adding that while the duties deal with foreign powers, ""the vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been a core power of Congress."" Justice Neil Gorsuch, meanwhile, raised separation-of-powers concerns and questioned the administration's assertion that Congress, through IEEPA, granted the president broad emergency authority over a foreign-affairs matter. What would stop Congress from ""abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce"" or declare war and give that power to the president?"" he asked. Once Congress delegates its authority to the president, it's difficult to reclaim, Gorsuch said, warning that the administration's theory marked a ""one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people's representatives."" Justice Brett Kavanaugh appeared sympathetic to the Trump administration's argument. He argued that Congress enacted a statute that gave the president an array of tools for responding to an emergency, and questioned why the law would allow for the imposition of a trade embargo, which may be viewed as an extreme step, as opposed to tariffs, a more targeted punishment. ""You're forcing the president to respond to an emergency ... and you're taking away the president's suite of tools when the one is much more extreme that is authorized,"" he said. ""That just seems a bit unusual."" Kavanaugh pointed to Mr. Trump's tariffs on goods from India over its purchase of Russian oil, which the president is using to pressure Moscow to end the war in Ukraine. ""If that's gone, that's a tool that's designed — talk about foreign-facing, the most serious crisis in the world,"" he said. ""And that's out the window."" Trump's tariffs Three lower courts have concluded that most of the president's tariffs are illegal, and a ruling from the Supreme Court upholding those decisions would deal a blow to Mr. Trump's plans to use tariffs as leverage to push U.S. trading partners to negotiate better trade deals. The president has also claimed that tariffs help to boost domestic manufacturing. At issue in the case are two sets of duties that Mr. Trump rolled out through a series of executive orders earlier this year. The president has relied on IEEPA to impose the tariffs. The first tranche set a baseline rate of 10% on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as well as higher reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries in response to what he said are ""large and persistent"" trade deficits. The second targeted China, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of varying rates for what he asserted was their failure to stop the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. In his executive orders, the president declared trade imbalances and the trafficking of drugs across U.S. borders as national emergencies, which unlocked IEEPA's powers. The law authorizes the president to ""regulate … importation"" to deal with ""any unusual and extraordinary threat"" to national security, foreign policy or the U.S. economy. Mr. Trump has argued that trade deficits and the failure to curtail the flow of illicit drugs into the country qualify as such a threat. Since Mr. Trump announced the import taxes in February and April — on what he called ""Liberation Day"" — the administration has reached trade deals with at least 10 countries and the European Union, and said it is ""actively negotiating"" with other nations. But after the rollout of the new levies, two sets of small businesses and a group of 12 states filed lawsuits arguing that IEEPA doesn't authorize the president's sweeping action. The first case was brought in Washington, D.C., by a pair of Illinois-based educational toy companies. The others, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, came from a group of five small businesses and Democratic officials from 12 states. The U.S. district court in Washington and the Court of International Trade separately ruled against the administration, concluding that IEEPA doesn't give the president the authority to impose his global and trafficking-related tariffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the trade court's decision in cases from the five small businesses and states, ruled 7-4 that many of the president's levies are illegal. The appeals court found that while IEEPA may authorize some tariffs, the law didn't allow for those ""of the magnitude"" of Mr. Trump's. Still, it allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the sweeping tariffs while the legal battles play out. Mr. Trump has also continued to rely on IEEPA to impose new levies or tweak existing rates, including raising Canadian tariffs to 35% (though many of its goods are subject to exemptions), imposing an additional 40% duty on Brazil and threatening China with an additional 100% duty, though the president has since walked that back. Mr. Trump announced last week following a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would be reducing the tariffs on goods imported from China. The Supreme Court is hearing the dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs on an extremely fast timeline, having agreed in September to decide the cases, and could move quickly to issue a ruling. A key issue in the case may be how the justices view the tariffs: whether they're an exercise of the president's power over foreign affairs or a tax on American consumers. Neal Katyal, representing the businesses challenging the tariffs, opened his arguments by saying, ""Tariffs are taxes"" and noting that Constitution vested that power in Congress. Echoing Gorsuch, Katyal said that if Congress were to delegate tariffing power to the president, it would be ""a one-way ratchet."" ""We will never get this power back if the government wins this case,"" he said. But Sauer told the high court that they are a tool to regulate foreign commerce. Roberts acknowledged the tension between the powers at issue, saying ""tariffs are a tax, and that's a core power of Congress."" But the chief justice also described the levies as a ""foreign-facing tax,"" which involves foreign affairs, a core power of the executive. ""One thing is quite clear, is that the foreign-facing tariffs have in several situations, were quite effective in achieving a particular objective. So I don't think you can just separate it,"" he told Katyal. ""When you say, well, this is a tax, Congress's power, it implicates very directly the president's foreign affairs power."" If the Supreme Court finds the tariffs to be illegal, as lower courts have done, one question is how potential reimbursements would be handled. Barrett was the only justice to ask about that process, noting that some have said the refunds of tariffs collected from U.S. importers would be ""a mess."" Katyal said he was only representing five companies, not a class action, and the government would refund the tariffs they paid. He said there was a specialized body of case law to address refunds, though ""it's difficult."" He suggested the court could offer prospective relief, but there are ""a lot of possibilities."" Trump administration argues for presidential powers In urging the high court to uphold the duties, the Trump administration has argued that Congress has long given the president broad authority to impose tariffs to address emergencies. IEEPA, Sauer wrote in a filing, is a continuation of that tradition because it gives the president the power to ""regulate … importation."" Sauer also said that the tariffs are an exercise of Mr. Trump's power over national security and foreign affairs, and courts should give deference to his determination that the duties are best suited for addressing national emergencies arising from trade deficits and drug-trafficking. Invalidating those levies, Sauer wrote, would have ""catastrophic consequences"" for national security, foreign policy and the economy. ""To the President, these cases present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation,"" he said. Mr. Trump is highly invested in the case, calling it ""one of the most important in the history of the country."" The president floated attending the arguments in person, but he reversed course Sunday, writing on social media that he did ""not want to distract from the importance of this decision."" Underscoring the importance of the case to the Trump administration, three members of Mr. Trump's Cabinet were in attendance: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Asked about the arguments later Wednesday, Mr. Trump told Fox News' Bret Baier a loss would be ""devastating for our country,"" calling it ""one of the most important cases in the history of our country."" Businesses warn of economic impact On the other side, the small businesses warned in court papers that Mr. Trump's tariffs have significant economic consequences. An analysis from the Tax Foundation found the duties will impose $1.7 trillion in new taxes on Americans by 2035, reduce GDP growth by 0.7% per year, and reduce income by 1.1% in 2026. Katyal, who argued on behalf of the companies before the Supreme Court, said the Trump administration's interpretation of IEEPA is a ""breathtaking assertion"" of power that requires explicit authorization from Congress. IEEPA, he said, doesn't even mention the word tariff or duty, and no president has understood the law to authorize them. If the Supreme Court agrees with Mr. Trump that the power to tax is found in IEEPA through the phrase ""regulate … importation,"" then ""the president, empowered by a supercharged U.S. Code, could tax everything from autos to zoos,"" Katyal wrote in a filing. The plaintiffs also argued that trade deficits hardly constitute an ""unusual and extraordinary threat,"" as imbalances have lasted for five decades, and Mr. Trump himself has described them as ""persistent."" Additionally, the power to levy taxes and duties rests squarely with Congress, and any delegations of that power have been ""explicit and strictly limited,"" they said. And indeed, there are numerous other statutes in which Congress has delegated its tariffing power — some of which have been used by Mr. Trump — though they put constraints on the president. Testing the boundaries of presidential authority The dispute over Mr. Trump's efforts to use IEEPA to impose his sweeping tariffs comes as he has tested the boundaries of his presidential authority, including through his firings of independent agency officials, the withholding of $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress and his efforts to overhaul the executive branch. Those cases have already been before the Supreme Court, though at earlier stages than the challenges to Mr. Trump's tariffs. In most of those emergency appeals, the conservative justices have allowed the Trump administration to temporarily enforce its policies while proceedings in the lower courts continue. Like those other cases, the dispute over whether Mr. Trump has the authority to impose duties on nearly every country under IEEPA without Congress could have significant implications for presidential power. The Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad assertions of executive authority on issues of major political and economic significance when Congress has not spoken clearly, invoking what's called the major questions doctrine to invalidate former President Joe Biden's plan to wipe away more than $400 billion in student loan debt and block an eviction moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic. That legal principle is raised in the battle over his tariffs, though the Trump administration argues that it doesn't apply to matters of national security and foreign policy. ""Judges lack the institutional competence to determine when foreign affairs pose an unusual and extraordinary threat that requires an emergency response; that is a task for the political Branches,"" Sauer wrote. But lawyers for the small businesses counter that tariffs are a tax on the American people, and the Constitution has vested the taxing power in Congress. ""The Framers understood that taxation is a potent power that can destroy the taxed as it fills the sovereign's coffers. The Constitution vests that extraordinary power exclusively in the branch of government considered most responsive to the citizenry: Congress,"" lawyers for the Illinois companies wrote in a filing. ""This Court should not lightly assume that Congress abdicated its core taxing power to permit the President to tax Americans with virtually no limits.""",left
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the one policy Donald Trump consistently favored was the mailing of “stimulus checks” (technically, economic-impact payments) to individual taxpayers, bearing his signature, as though this federal-government largesse was a gift from the president himself. Indeed, he pitched a temper tantrum not long before his first term ended because the stimulus checks Congress authorized him to send out were $600, while he much preferred $2,000. Such direct payments to the whole country were later, of course, denounced by many conservatives as inflationary, mostly when they were continued by a Democratic president and Congress in 2021 (Joe Biden, by the way, didn’t sign those checks, though he later joked that maybe he should have). Trump’s desire for a $2,000 check he could take credit for survived his four years out of power. Early this year, he embraced an incredibly half-baked idea to give taxpayers a $5,000 “DOGE Dividend,” to reflect the vast savings that Elon Musk was then claiming he was going to generate from chainsawing federal agencies. Unfortunately, DOGE wasn’t saving much of anything at all, so people waiting for their $5,000 checks were disappointed. The 47th president didn’t give up, though; he keeps looking for a big, fat cookie jar full of money he can gift to the great unwashed, particularly now that they are so stubbornly finding life in the economic paradise of Trump 2.0 less than affordable. His latest big idea is a “tariff dividend,” as broadcast by a Truth Social post on November 9, shortly after affordability-obsessed voters gave his party a spanking: We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place. A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone Much like the DOGE Dividend idea, the tariff dividend lollipop has some math problems, as was pointed out by those spoilsports at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: Assuming these dividends are designed like the COVID-era Economic Impact Payments, which went to both adults and children, we estimate each round of payments would cost about $600 billion. In comparison, President Trump’s new tariffs currently in effect have raised approximately $100 billion thus far and — including those tariffs that have been ruled illegal pending a Supreme Court appeal — are projected to raise about $300 billion per year. That’s a good point about Trump counting — or in this case, vastly overcounting — his chickens before they hatch, given widespread expectations of an adverse judicial decision on the authority he cited for his tariffs. There are also reports that the administration plans to pursue major exemptions from the tariffs of food and other essentials in the very near term. On top of all that, the circular nature of this massive transfer of dollars is hard to ignore. If the dividends are supposed to offset the cost to consumers of tariffs (Trump doesn’t admit that exists, but anyone with basic economics credentials does), why not refrain from imposing those tariffs in the first place? It’s just a vast money-go-round. The odds are vanishingly low that the “tariff dividends” are happening, of course. They would require congressional approval, including 60 votes in the Senate, and Democrats aren’t going to help Trump out of his self-imposed affordability problems. There’s also a chance that the administration is just going to rebrand tax proposals it has already made, some of which have already been enacted, hints Treasury secretary Scott Bessent: “I haven’t spoken to the president about this yet, but the $2,000 dividend could come in lots of forms,” adding, “It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president’s agenda. You know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.” So the president’s dreams of cash-on-the-barrel vote buying may have to be watered down and pushed into the future a bit. It’s very clear he won’t give up on the best of all economic messages: Here’s more money for you, courtesy of Donald J. Trump. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

"Brazil’s former President Jair Bolsonaro must begin serving his 27-year prison sentence for plotting an attempted coup, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ruled Tuesday. The former president’s defense team had chosen not to file a final appeal after his conviction for plotting a coup in 2022 to overthrow his successor, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. As a result, Moraes requested that the conviction be deemed final, quashing any chance of further appeals and triggering Bolsonaro’s 27-year sentence. Bolsonaro has been jailed in Brazil’s Federal Police headquarters since Saturday, after police took him into custody for tampering with his court-ordered ankle monitor. On Tuesday, Moraes said Bolsonaro would serve out his sentence at the headquarters. Bolsonaro’s attorney Paulo Cunha Bueno said in a post on X that the former president would pursue an appeal to fight the conviction, despite the court ruling that their decision is final. On Saturday, Bolsonaro’s lawyers described the former president’s arrest as “unjustifiable” and claimed that his health is at risk while imprisoned. Later, the Supreme Court released a video, which it says shows Bolsonaro admitting to tampering with his ankle monitor with a soldering iron. He allegedly said that he did so not as an attempt to escape from house arrest, but rather because new medications had caused him to hallucinate. The case that landed Bolsonaro in prison began shortly after he lost his 2022 re-election bid to Lula da Silva. Federal authorities say that the former president and his co-conspirators almost immediately began mapping out an illegal path to retain the presidency, with one result being a dramatic January 8, 2023 attack on government buildings in Brasilia by Bolsonaro supporters. After US President Donald Trump – a Bolsonaro ally – was reelected in 2024, the United States soon began commenting on the case as a matter of foreign policy. In July, Trump even imposed steep tariffs on some Brazilian exports, urging Brazil to drop what he called a “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro. By the time Bolsonaro was taken into custody over the weekend, however, the White House had carved out tariff exceptions for Brazil’s biggest exports. Asked about Bolsonaro’s arrest on Saturday, Trump told reporters he hadn’t heard about it but that it was “too bad.” This is a developing story and will be updated.",left
"Black Friday once again proved that Americans are willing to shop when they spot bargains. Mastercard reported a steady 4.1% increase in US retail sales on Black Friday and Adobe Analytics said online shopping surged by 9.1%. Salesforce expects Cyber Monday sales to also climb by 4%. All of that is a pretty solid showing, given the gloom and doom in economic polls, crumbling consumer confidence and mounting frustrations over the cost of living. However, beneath the surface of those strong headline numbers lies a disturbing trend: Americans are spending more but getting less. Although overall US online shopping increased 3% on Black Friday, it was driven by a 7% jump in the average selling price, according to Salesforce. Order volume, which measures how much was bought in a certain time frame, also declined 1% versus Black Friday 2024, Salesforce said. And shopping carts were smaller on Black Friday, as units per transaction dropped by 2%. “Consumers are paying more per item than last year, but it’s not stopping them from coming out and spending,” Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights at Salesforce, told CNN in a phone interview. Overall, prices during Cyber Week have risen 7% on average, according to Salesforce, higher than the 5% jump last year. The tariff factor Salesforce blamed the price hikes at least in part on historic tariff hikes. The Trump administration has spiked tariffs on US imports to the highest level since 1935, according to The Budget Lab at Yale. While it’s difficult to definitively attribute how much of the price hikes are linked to tariffs, some of the categories experiencing the biggest price increases are exposed to tariffs. For instance, online average selling prices on home goods (furniture, appliances, dining, art & decor) spiked 24% on Black Friday, according to Salesforce. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on some types of furniture in October, as well as on countries where America imports furniture from, such as Vietnam, Indonesia and India. Salesforce said online prices also jumped by 6% on clothes and 7% on electronics — two categories of products that America heavily imports. Trump warned earlier this year that tariffs could mean Americans get less stuff. “All I’m saying is that a young lady, a 10-year-old girl, 9-year-old girl, 15-year-old girl, doesn’t need 37 dolls,” Trump said in May. Salesforce didn’t break down how much prices went up or down for toys, the majority of which the US imports from China. Another factor that could be driving up prices: Consumers are leaning into higher-priced categories such as luxury and home goods, according to Schwartz. Lower-income Americans cutting back? Of course, the Black Friday sales results don’t reveal a key piece of information: who is doing all that shopping. The rise of a K-shaped economy has meant that while many higher-income consumers are shopping aggressively, some less affluent Americans are cutting back as they grapple with the high cost of living and rising unemployment. Before the holiday shopping season got underway, lower-income Americans signaled plans they would do some significant belt-tightening. According to Gallup, Americans in households earning less than $50,000 planned to spend $651 on holiday gifts, down from $776 last year. Even middle-income Americans planned to cut back spending to $847, down from $902 last year. By contrast, high-income consumers planned to ramp up holiday spending to $1,479, up modestly from $1,403 last year. Cyber Monday deals Salesforce found evidence that consumers continue to be very price sensitive, prompting stores to discount more heavily over the weekend. “Consumers did pull back at first, but as discounting increased, demand started to kick back in over the weekend,” said Schwartz. Lured by those deeper discounts, US order volume turned positive over the weekend, rising by 2% on Saturday and Sunday, according to Salesforce. Overall sales growth increased by 5%. “Consumers waited — and they were smart to wait,” Schwartz said. Looking ahead, Salesforce is projecting $13.4 billion in US online shopping sales on Monday, up 4% from last year. The deepest discounts are expected to be for home (26%), health & beauty (35%) and clothes (37%). Only time will tell whether those deals will be deep enough to lure consumers grappling with a years-long case of sticker shock.",left

"Trump proposes $2,000 dividend funded by tariffs. Here's what experts say about the plan. President Donald Trump on Nov. 9 said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies. Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven ""record investment"" in U.S. manufacturing. ""A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,"" Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post last week. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later told Fox News that the rebates would likely be given to families making ""less than, say, $100,000."" That threshold is still in discussion, he added. Mr. Trump has previously floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office. The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties. Speaking from the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said his administration plans on issuing dividends from tariffs ""probably in the middle of next year."" He said ""thousands of dollars"" would go to ""moderate income, middle income"" Americans, adding that his administration has taken in ""tremendous amounts of money"" from tariffs. How could a rebate work? Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks. For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden. Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' ""big, beautiful"" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers. Bessent on Nov. 9 told Fox News that the dividend ""could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways."" He added, ""You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda — you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans."" Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend? Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, in a post on X. ""Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,"" she said. For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs. If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks. A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added. ""The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,"" she said. ""Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate."" Last week, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that ""money left over"" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt. Could tariff checks boost inflation? The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending new tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said. That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers. Tariff dividends ""would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,"" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points. ""It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,"" she added. A White House official said that ""the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating"" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",left
"White House cuts tariffs on more goods from Brazil President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order removing tariffs on Brazilian beef, coffee and other goods that were previously subject to a 40% levy which Mr. Trump announced in July. Mr. Trump cited ""various officials"" whom he said advised him that ""certain agricultural imports from Brazil should no longer be subject"" to the 40% tariff, in part because of progress the U.S. has made in its trade negotiations with Brazil. The order applies to Brazilian imports to the U.S. on or after Nov. 13, according to the order. Refunds could be owed to businesses that paid the duties, Mr. Trump noted. Mr. Trump last week cut tariffs on beef, coffee, bananas and other agricultural imports as Americans grapple with high prices at the grocery store. That tariff relief came a day after Mr. Trump announced reciprocal trade agreements with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador. At the time, senior administration officials said the agreement frameworks were largely focused on allowing those foreign markets to accept more U.S. goods. Food prices rose 3.1% in September compared to one year ago, while roasted coffee had risen nearly 19% over the same period, according to federal data.",left

"White House announces South American trade deals to try to lower some food prices They could bring down prices on products like coffee, bananas and beef. The White House on Thursday during a background call with reporters announced framework deals with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Ecuador that it hopes will bring down the costs of certain groceries. These deals come after President Donald Trump and some of his top allies promised an announcement on a deal to help alleviate the price increases of bananas, coffee and other agricultural goods, but a senior administration official on the call could not provide any specifics about how much relief this would bring to Americans' wallets. According to data from the September 2025 Consumer Price Index, coffee prices have spiked 18.9%, bananas are up 6.9% and beef prices are up 14.7% in the past year. Economists have attributed some of the price increases for coffee and bananas to Trump's tariffs -- these are products that the U.S. does not produce in large quantities and relies on imports from other countries. The announcement does not include relief on the 50% tariffs on Brazil, a major source of U.S. coffee and beef imports. The senior administration official announced that the reciprocal tariff rate for Guatemala, El Salvador, and Ecuador will remain the same 10% rate set on the so-called ""Liberation Day"" in April. Ecuador's reciprocal tariff remained unchanged at 15%. However, the official noted that these deals will provide ""relief on a number of items."" In press releases about the framework deals with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Ecuador, the important caveat is that the U.S. promises to ""remove its reciprocal tariffs on certain qualifying exports from"" those nations on products that ""cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States in sufficient quantities."" For Argentina, the deal promises to remove the reciprocal tariff rate on ""certain unavailable natural resources and non-patented articles for use in pharmaceutical applications."" When asked what effect this will have on prices and when Americans could feel it, the senior administration official sidestepped on specifics. But the they did add that the White House expects ""some positive effects for prices"" on products like coffee, cocoa and bananas. ""I don't have a precise number on how this might have the impact, right? I mean, I think Secretary Bessent is right in that to the extent that any of the tariff price was passed down to the consumer, I would hope that the retailers, you know, no longer need to do that,"" the senior administration official said. ""I don't know exactly where, you know, how the tariff was allocated along the supply chain there. I can't control a weather event, but our expectation is that there'll be some, you know, some positive effects for prices, for things like coffee, cocoa, bananas,"" the senior administration official added. The agreements on reciprocal trade for ""most of these countries"" will be signed and publicized within the next two weeks, the official said. Guatemala and El Salvador already give substantial duty-free treatment to the U.S., the official said, but there are non-tariff barriers that have existed for a long time in all four countries. The framework agreements announced Thursday come after the White House announced similar framework agreements throughout Trump's trip to Asia with countries like Vietnam and Thailand and published full agreements on reciprocal trade with Malaysia and Cambodia. ""With all of these deals, the ones in Asia, the ones we're announcing today, we maintain the tariff. We get some tariff relief on certain products or goods, but at the same time, we open up foreign markets in ways that they have not been opened before,"" the senior administration official said. U.S. in trade talks with Switzerland During the call, the official also confirmed Switzerland is in trade talks with the Trump administration. That comes after Switzerland was slapped with a 39% tariff rate in August. The official said Swiss representatives were at the White House Thursday for meetings, speaking with the administration about deals with the U.S. that could lower its tariff rates. The conversations were ""very positive,"" the official said. ""They are very aware of their trade deficit with the United States and the need to reduce it and eliminate it, and they have presented plans to do so. And like with many of our trade deals, it's a combination of things, where, if this deal is accepted by the President and the Swiss people, we would see a reduction in tariffs into Switzerland,"" the senior administration official said.",left
"As President Donald Trump touts new deals to cut the cost of blockbuster drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound, he’s barely mentioned Medicare’s drug price negotiation program — even though the government is expected to announce lower prices before the end of the month. The program, created under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, gave Medicare the authority to negotiate directly with drugmakers on some of the costliest medications. A Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) spokesperson said the agency is preparing to release the second round of negotiated prices by Nov. 30 — covering 15 drugs, up from 10 last year, and adding Ozempic and Wegovy to the list. The newly negotiated prices won’t take effect until 2027. The lack of attention has puzzled health policy experts, who say the program could play an important role in lowering prescription drug costs for millions of older adults in the U.S. About 1-in-5 adults say they’ve not filled a prescription because of cost, according to a poll from the nonpartisan health policy research group KFF. “Certainly, the flurry of announcements and lack of details [on negotiations] make things confusing,” said Dr. Benjamin Rome, a primary care physician and health policy researcher at Harvard Medical School. Trump’s approach to lowering drug prices has leaned heavily on executive orders and voluntary deals with drugmakers, rather than legislation. Last week, he announced agreements with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly — the makers of Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively — to lower prices for some doses in exchange for tariff relief and accelerated Food and Drug Administration review of new drugs. Several experts described the details as murky and questioned whether the agreements would translate into real savings for Americans. Trump has struck similar deals with Pfizer and Astrazenca. Rome said the Medicare negotiation program is seen as the steadier, more reliable path to lowering costs for Americans. Drugmakers can decline to participate — but doing so would likely require pulling their drugs from Medicare entirely, cutting them off from one of the nation’s largest markets. Several companies have challenged the negotiation program in court, but those lawsuits have so far been unsuccessful. “Although it’s great that the Trump administration wants to aggressively negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies, these ad hoc negotiations seem to be more about announcing short-term political victories,” Rome said. “I would be very skeptical of relying solely on voluntary deals with drug manufacturers as a main policy for making medications more affordable to Americans,” Rome added. “By contrast, the IRA absolutely will save money for taxpayers through the negotiation process.” Despite the looming announcement, the White House has said little publicly about the negotiation program or how it fits into Trump’s broader push to lower drug prices. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said: “Democrats endlessly touted the Inflation Reduction Act, which ironically under Biden’s watch did little but increase Medicare premiums. The Trump administration is focused on results, and our historic drug pricing deals with global pharmaceutical giants are proof that we will continue to deliver meaningful change for the American people.” Last year, the Biden administration announced agreements to lower prices on 10 prescription drugs under Medicare, with those cuts set to take effect in 2026. The drugs included the blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis, along with several cancer and diabetes treatments. At the time, administration officials projected the negotiations would save Medicare enrollees $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs in the first year. Experts say the second round may have an even larger impact than last year’s since some of the drugs on the list — particularly Ozempic and Wegovy — are becoming the most widely used and most expensive in Medicare. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan government group that provides budget and economic information to Congress, projects that, because of negotiations, the net price of Ozempic and Wegovy will “fall substantially” beginning in 2027 — cutting Medicare’s spending on each patient who uses the drugs by one third. The CBO also expects that those lower prices are likely to put pressure on other GLP-1 drugs, including Mounjaro and Zepbound. Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said it’s possible the negotiations may have factored into Trump’s deal on Wegovy and Zepbound last week. When asked on a call with reporters whether Trump’s deal was related to the negotiations, senior administration officials insisted it was not. “We’re all eagerly awaiting the announcement of what prices have been negotiated,” Dusetzina said. “It could very well be that this is where the negotiations landed.” Other experts raised questions about how Trump’s deal fits with the negotiations — or whether the two efforts are even aligned at all. Tricia Neuman, executive director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF, said it’s “not clear how the recent White House announcement dovetails with the Inflation Reduction Act when it comes to negotiated prices for GLP-1s.” Rome said Trump’s deals are unlikely to interfere or undermine the negotiation process. “That process is very clearly spelled out by CMS and has been ongoing throughout the year and will repeat for another 20 drugs early next year,” he said. “I don’t think these side deals with Lilly and Novo will change that.” Neuman added that while the voluntary deals may be drawing more attention from the White House, they don’t replace the long term impacts of Medicare negotiations. “The IRA’s Medicare negotiations program is baked into the law, and is up and running, and could ultimately lead to lower prices for far more drugs over time,” she said.",left
"OnePlus wants to sell you its new flagship phone; it just doesn’t know when it will be able to. Like so many other things these days, the OnePlus 15 is in limbo thanks to fallout from the government shutdown. The OnePlus 15 will go on sale in the US… sometime Your connecting flight isn’t the only thing that got held up by the government shutdown. Your connecting flight isn’t the only thing that got held up by the government shutdown. The 15 launched earlier this year in China, and OnePlus has announced pricing for the US: $899 for a version with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. That’s the same as the OnePlus 13, which is pretty neat when you consider the whole tariff situation. But because of the federal shutdown, OnePlus hasn’t been able to get the final FCC certification it needs to sell the phone in the US. And even with the shutdown at an end, it’s hard to say how long it will take the FCC to catch up on a month’s worth of work. According to a statement from the company’s head of marketing, Spenser Blank, OnePlus has submitted the required testing and is more or less just waiting on the final stamp of approval: As is the case with every smartphone manufacturer, the United States’ Federal Communications Commission certifies OnePlus devices before they are sold in the U.S. As a result of the government shutdown, device certifications have been delayed. Subsequently, U.S. sales for the OnePlus 15 will be postponed until they have been secured. The OnePlus 15 has already finished all the required tests from the FCC’s recognized labs and the certification application has been formally submitted. We are hopeful that approvals can be generated quickly and as a result, we can bring the OnePlus 15 to our customers in the U.S. expeditiously. Anyone interested in the OnePlus 15 can sign up for an email alert when it goes on sale by heading to Oneplus.com/us. And there’s one major reason to consider doing so if you’re shopping for a new phone: the 15 offers some of the best battery life you can find in the US, thanks to its use of silicon-carbon technology. Chinese manufacturers like OnePlus’ parent company Oppo have embraced the new tech, which allows for thinner, higher-capacity batteries than traditional lithium-ion. The OnePlus 13 used the same kind of battery, but the 15 comes with a huge 7,300mAh capacity compared to the 6,000mAh of its predecessor. If you live in the US and you’ve been waiting for a phone with genuine two-day battery life, then the wait is almost over. You’re just going to have to hold on a little bit longer.",left
"US supreme court justices on Wednesday appeared sceptical of Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose a series of tariffs in a closely watched hearing in Washington. The court, which is split 6-3 between conservative and liberal justices, challenged the government’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose global levies – raising questions over whether a key pillar of Mr Trump’s second presidency will be struck down by the country’s top court. The case was brought by groups of US businesses, who were joined by 12 US states, that argued they had been harmed by Mr Trump’s tariffs. Losing it would complicate his aggressive trade policy, threatening the “reciprocal” tariffs that are the centrepiece of his second-term trade war, as well as levies placed on China, Canada and Mexico to retaliate for their alleged involvement in trading the deadly opioid fentanyl. READ MORE A loss would also call into question more than $50 billion in extra tariff revenue that the government has collected in 2025, a windfall that has soothed investors nervous about US borrowing levels. Mr Trump has framed the case as existential. It is “literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country”, he wrote in a social media post on Tuesday. “With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security. Without it, we are virtually defenceless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us.” John Sauer, the US solicitor-general, told the court the president had determined that “our exploding trade deficits have brought us to the brink of an economic and national security catastrophe”. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who attended the court in person, said he was optimistic about the hearing. “It went very well. I think the solicitor-general has made a very powerful case,” he told reporters. Asked whether tariff revenue would be refunded if the government loses the case, Mr Bessent told Fox Business: “We will cross that bridge if we come to it, but I’m confident we won’t have to.” The US was in an “economic emergency”, he said, adding that “real goal here is to rebalance our trading relationships and bring home manufacturing”. Some members of the court’s conservative wing, including justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, appeared open to the government’s arguments. But other conservative members challenged Mr Trump’s use of IEEPA, which no other president has invoked to impose tariffs. The policy’s “vehicle is imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress”, said chief justice John Roberts. Justice Neil Gorsuch cautioned against “a one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people’s elected representatives”. He also warned that once Congress delegated its powers to presidents, “in the real world, it can never get that power back ... What president is ever going to give that power back?” Amy Coney Barrett, the conservative justice who has been attacked by Trump supporters for sometimes siding against the government in her decisions, also questioned the basis of the tariffs. “Is it your contention that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the defence and industrial base? I mean, Spain? France? I could see it with some countries, but explain to me why as many countries needed to be subject to the reciprocal tariff policy as are,” she asked Mr Sauer. The top court has already weighed in on several Trump policies – including allowing deportations to third countries. But this is the first time it will squarely examine the legal basis of a critical part of the president’s sprawling second-term agenda. The court’s liberal wing also raised doubts around the tariffs’ legality. Justice Elena Kagan questioned Mr Trump’s claims that the US is facing a national emergency, which have underpinned many of his policies and which the government argues cannot be reviewed. “It turns out we’re in emergencies, everything all the time about, like, half the world,” she said. Neal Katyal, the lawyer representing the businesses that sued the government, told the court it was “simply implausible that, in enacting IEEPA, Congress handed the president the power to overhaul the entire tariff system and the US economy in the process, allowing him to set and reset tariffs on any and every product, from any and every country, at any and all times”. While the administration has other tools to impose tariffs, none can be deployed as quickly and simply as IEEPA, raising the possibility of a short delay to the collection of levies should the justices strike down its case. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025",left
"President Donald Trump inserted fresh tension into the high-stakes Ukraine-Russia peace talks Sunday, publicly accusing Kyiv’s leaders of showing “zero gratitude” for U.S. support just as U.S. officials in Geneva were working to show a united front. Trump’s Truth Social comments landed at a delicate moment: His administration is pressing Ukraine to accept a 28-point peace proposal by Thanksgiving, even as confusion over the plan’s authorship and concerns from European allies and U.S. lawmakers have raised questions about whose interests it serves. Senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff, met with Ukrainian officials in Geneva this weekend to move peace talks forward with a goal of ending the war. After a full day of talks, Rubio told reporters Sunday that “a tremendous amount of progress” had been made. “So it is in my personal view that we’ve had probably the most productive and meaningful meeting so far in this entire process since we’ve been involved in from the beginning,” he said. Another U.S. official told NBC News that Rubio, Witkoff and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll met with a Ukrainian delegation at the U.S. Mission in Geneva. The U.S. officials said the discussions were “positive and constructive.” How a teen street musician became the face of the Kremlin’s crackdown Known by her stage name, Naoko, 18-year-old Diana Loginova gained popularity performing songs by musicians who have spoken out against Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Inevitably, in a country where nearly all forms of dissent have been crushed, Russian authorities quickly took notice. Naoko was first detained last month for organizing a “mass simultaneous gathering of citizens” during a performance, which authorities said disrupted public order, and was sentenced to 13 days behind bars. She has since been rearrested twice. “It looks like Russian authorities want to use the persecution of Naoko, as with many other public cases, to intimidate others,” Dmitrii Anisimov, a human rights activist and spokesperson for the OVD-Info protest monitoring group, told NBC News. Meet the Press New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said that he still believes Trump is a “fascist” and a “despot” but that he viewed their first face-to-face meeting at the White House as an “opportunity” to work together on lowering the cost of living for New Yorkers. “Everything that I’ve said in the past I continue to believe,” he told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker about his negative comments. He also spoke about his attitude going into the meeting and why it ended up so friendly. “I thought again and again about what it would mean for New Yorkers if we could establish a productive relationship that would focus on the issues that those New Yorkers stay up late at night thinking about,” rather than keep trading barbs, Mamdani said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was also on the show, and he said “no” when he was asked whether the United States was at risk of entering a recession in 2026 — and that he’s confident Americans will feel economic relief next year stemming from Trump’s tariff agenda and trade deals. “I am very, very optimistic on 2026. We have set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy,” Bessent told Welker. He acknowledged that there is some pressure on the economy in certain sectors like housing, responding to comments from National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett this month that “we’re starting to see pockets of the economy that look like they might be in a recession.” “Clearly, housing has been struggling, and interest rate-sensitive sectors have been in a recession,” Bessent said. He added that the recent government shutdown, which was the longest in history, also squeezed the economy.

"Surging import costs. Mounting payroll and healthcare expenses. A shortage of affordable loans. And a stressed-out workforce. Small businesses are facing mounting pressure from America’s affordability crisis. Doug Scheffel, owner of a family-run ETM Manufacturing in Massachusetts, laid off about a quarter of his employees in April as the Trump administration’s haphazard tariff rollout dented demand for the machine parts and sheet metal his company sells. “Everyone is hunkering down and building up cash. It’s never been this bad,” Scheffel told CNN in a phone interview. “It’s very uncertain and impossible to plan in this environment.” Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy, accounting for the vast majority of total businesses in the nation, nearly half of all employees and the bulk of the job growth. Like other small businesses, ETM Manufacturing can’t take advantage of growth opportunities because financing is so expensive. The average rate on a new urban small business term loan was over 7% at the end of last year, according to the Kansas City Fed, but many small businesses face rates well north of 10%. “It’s infuriating,” Scheffel said. High prices at the grocery store and elsewhere have left some of ETM’s employees preoccupied with their own finances. “Most of our employees are distracted. They’re worried about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their kid,” Scheffel said. “Bad stuff happens when they’re not totally focused.” Scheffel’s employees are hardly alone. About one in four US households are living paycheck to paycheck, meaning they are spending over 95% of their income on necessities like housing and groceries, according to estimates from Bank of America. The mood among mom-and-pop shops on Main Street is mixed. While small business owners tell CNN they are hopeful about the future and excited about how artificial intelligence can help them, some are concerned about the headaches incurred by the ever-changing trade war and high costs. Bryan Pate, CEO of San Diego-based PT Motion Works, an exercise equipment company that sells elliptical bikes, GIBBON SlackBoards and Indo Board balance boards, told CNN that his business is struggling to keep up with rapidly rising healthcare costs. Over the past two decades, the average cost of single coverage health insurance has surged by 120% for companies with fewer than 50 employees, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), a nonprofit that advocates for small businesses. “It’s unbelievable how much healthcare has gone up,” Pate said, noting this is a big disadvantage small businesses have against large corporations. “It’s an unfair barrier to hiring.” ‘So much anxiety’ Those healthcare and payroll expenses add to the pressure from the historic tariff hikes under President Donald Trump. “We just don’t know what the guy is gonna do. It creates so much anxiety and time-wasting,” Pate said of Trump’s evolving tariff policies. Trump has raised tariffs on US imports to an average rate of 16.8%, the highest since 1935, according to estimates released by The Budget Lab at Yale on Monday. Pate said his businesses have been hammered by tariffs — including the 20% levy on Taiwan, where its bikes are manufactured. Ironically, the tariffs are wiping out some US manufacturing jobs. Pate said his company recently ended contracts with seven assembly workers based in San Diego and now employs workers in Mexico instead. And Pate plans to raise prices on bikes to offset the cost of tariffs but worries that will erode demand. “It’s been economically painful, and long-term, if tariffs stay where they are, it’s just not going to work,” he said. Troy Rackley, CEO at The Next Level of Performance, a Sarasota, Florida-based water treatment technology company, told CNN on the sidelines of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington he has had to raise prices on some of his products due to US tariffs on imports from Australia and China. Rackley dismissed the argument that exporting countries are paying US tariffs and hopes the Supreme Court rules against the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to justify its global tariffs. “China, Mexico and Canada don’t pay. I’m the one that’s paying for it,” Rackley said. “I pay taxes on my income, and now I have to pay additional taxes on what I bring in.” High borrowing costs Khari Parker, a graduate of the Goldman Sachs small business program and co-founder of Connie’s Chicken and Waffles in Baltimore, isn’t facing any tariff trouble, but he’s struggling to find affordable capital. “We’ve being hit with very, very high rates of 20% to 30%,” Parker said. The Trump administration has worked to support small businesses by providing capital through the Small Business Administration (SBA). Since Trump took office, the SBA estimates it has approved more than 58,000 small business loans worth over $32 billion. For fiscal 2025, which closed at the end of September, the SBA said it guaranteed a record-setting $44.8 billion of small business loans. Small business optimism increased sharply after Trump took office before retreating after Trump’s tariff plans spooked financial markets, according to the NFIB. Optimism later recovered and is currently slightly above its 52-year average. Immigration crackdown shrinks labor pool One recurring struggle for small businesses like Parker’s: attracting talent. “It’s very hard to find workers. We can’t always offer the same competitive benefits or pay that larger businesses can,” Parker said. For some companies in construction, those challenges have been amplified by the immigration crackdown. “A lot of the workforce is nervous from all the stuff going on with immigration,” said Antonio McMillion, president of Maryland-based developer MFP Management & Construction. McMillion said his company has been forced to hire more expensive workers, raising their labor costs on some projects by up to 40%. “Hopefully we can pass on the price to the client, but that could also mean you don’t get the job,” he said. Pate, the CEO of PT Motion Works, is very frustrated by tariffs but remains optimistic about the future because of his employees’ resilience in the face of uncertainty. “It could be very depressing and demoralizing,” he said, “but no one is throwing in the towel.”",left
"It is rare to find a senior Trump appointee who has studied at Sciences Po and spent time working in one of the European Union’s institutions. Jamieson Greer, a hawk on trade who shares Donald Trump’s belief that tariffs can force a rebalancing of the global economic order and return manufacturing jobs to the US, has a curious backstory that spans stints working, proselytising and studying across Brussels, Luxembourg and Paris. That backstory explains the US trade envoy’s presence at the most unlikely of events in Brussels last Saturday: a ceremony symbolically breaking ground on a new Mormon temple in the Belgian capital. Greer grew up in a mobile home in Paradise, northern California. “My parents regularly worked several jobs to help make ends meet,” he told his senate confirmation hearing. READ MORE A practising Mormon, he studied at Brigham Young University in Utah, which is affiliated to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That church connection took him to Europe as a young man. Greer served as a missionary in Belgium, a role Mormon officials told me involves sharing the restored gospel of Jesus Christ “with anyone who becomes interested”. Though US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has a greater influence over trade policy and a more direct line to Trump, Greer is still an important figure in the president’s wider orbit, particularly when it comes to tariffs. Both Lutnick and Greer were in Brussels this week to talk tariffs with EU trade ministers. Over an hour-and-40-minute lunch, the two sides took stock of the deal this summer that saw the EU settle for 15 per cent tariffs on future trade, in return for Trump dropping threats of even higher import taxes. Greer flew in a few days early to attend a ceremony marking the start of development on a new 25,500sq ft Mormon temple in the heart of Brussels. Tomás Rau, a 10-year-old church member, opened the event with a prayer in French. Greer, who is fluent, would have had no problem following what was said. Belgium was not the only European country Greer has spent time in. The America First advocate spent a year in 2006 studying international business law at Science Po, a prestigious university in Paris that counts Emmanuel Macron and many other former French presidents among its alumni. He moved to the French capital with his wife, Marlo, and their first child, Noëlle, was born during their time in Paris. Giving a speech after receiving a Science Po alumni award in 2022, Greer recalled how the couple nearly missed their window to secure a student visa at the French embassy. “The one day we could come was July 13th, which is the day before July 14th which is Bastille Day ... You would not be surprised to know that the French embassy consular services division was planning to close early,” he said. “Through sheer luck or something more deliberate, we were the last people to make it through the door of the embassy,” he said. Afterwards Greer worked in the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice for a few months in 2007, assisting a Czech judge. Whatever about a senior Trump official having spent time studying or working in Europe in their youth, you surely won’t find many others who have completed traineeships, and thus known as a stagiaire, in an EU institution. A career in international trade law that followed saw Greer end up as the top aide to Robert Lighthizer, an influential figure who steered Trump’s aggressive trade policy during his first term. Lighthizer did not land a job in Trump’s new administration. Greer, a protege, was appointed to his old boss’s position, US trade envoy, a role that has seen him go out and sell Trump’s sweeping tariff agenda. Greer has described tariffs as a “formidable stick” that can be waved above the heads of America’s economic partners, to pressure them into concessions. In his confirmation hearing he talked about using trade leverage to shore up US military, economic and technological “dominance” for years to come. Speaking to reporters in Brussels, he reiterated the desire in Washington to “rebalance” the EU-US trading relationship. “We have a common history, we have fought wars together, we should be aligned on economic matters as well,” he said. In a clear sign the EU’s regulations on Big Tech remain in their crosshairs, Greer called for the union’s regime of digital rules to be “modified” to accommodate the concerns of tech multinationals and the US Government, who have loudly complained they go too far. Greer’s supposed fond memories of his time in Brussels won’t stop him advising Trump to reach for the stick to get his way, something Europe should be wary about.",left

"US president Donald Trump on Friday rolled back tariffs on more than 200 food products, including such staples as coffee, beef, bananas and orange juice, in the face of growing angst among American consumers about the high cost of groceries. The new exemptions – which took effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday – mark a sharp reversal for Mr Trump, who has long insisted that the sweeping import duties he imposed earlier this year are not fuelling inflation. “They may in some cases,” raise prices, Mr Trump said of his tariffs when asked about the move aboard Air Force One on Friday evening. But he insisted that overall, the US has “virtually no inflation.” Democrats have won a string of victories in state and local elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City, where growing voter concerns about affordability, including high food prices, were a key topic. READ MORE Mr Trump also told reporters aboard Air Force One that he would move forward with a $2,000 payment to lower- and middle-income Americans that would be funded by tariff revenues at some point next year. “The tariffs allow us to give a dividend if we want to do that. Now we’re going to do a dividend and we’re also reducing debt,” he said. The Trump administration announced framework trade deals on Thursday that, once finalised, will eliminate tariffs on certain foods and other imports from Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala and El Salvador, with US officials eyeing additional agreements before year’s end. Friday’s list includes products US consumers routinely purchase to feed their families at home, many of which have seen double-digit year-over-year price increases. It includes more than 200 items ranging from oranges, acai berries and paprika to cocoa, chemicals used in food production, fertilisers and even communion wafers. The White House, in a fact sheet on the order, said it came on the heels of “significant progress the President has made in securing more reciprocal terms for our bilateral trade relationships”. It said Mr Trump decided certain food items could be exempted since they were not grown or processed in the United States, and given the conclusion of nine framework deals, two final agreements on reciprocal trade, and two investment deals. Ground beef, as of the latest available data for September, was nearly 13 per cent more expensive, according to Consumer Price Index data, and steaks cost almost 17 per cent more than a year ago. Increases for both were the largest in more than three years, dating back to when inflation was nearing its peak under Mr Trump’s predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden. Although the US is a big beef producer, a persistent shortage of cattle in recent years has kept beef prices high. Banana prices were about 7 per cent higher, while tomatoes were 1 per cent higher. Overall costs for food consumed at home were up 2.7 per cent in September. The tariff exemptions won praise from many industry groups, while some expressed disappointment that their products were excluded from the exemptions. “Today’s action should help consumers, whose morning cup of coffee will hopefully become more affordable, as well as US manufacturers, which utilise many of these products in their supply chains and production lines,” FMI-Food Industry Association president Leslie Sarasin said in a statement. Distilled Spirits Council president Chris Swonger said excluding spirits from the European Union and Britain “is yet another blow to the US hospitality industry just as the critical holiday season kicks into high gear”. [ Epstein files: Trump taunted from beyond the graveOpens in new window ] “Scotch, cognac and Irish whiskey are value-added agricultural products that cannot be produced in the United States,” Mr Swonger said. Asked if further changes were planned, Mr Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, “I don’t think it’ll be necessary. “We just did a little bit of a rollback. The prices of coffee were a little bit high, now they’ll be on the low side in a very short period.” Mr Trump has upended the global trading system by imposing a 10 per cent base tariff on imports from every country, plus additional specific duties that vary from state to state. He has focused squarely on the issue of affordability in recent weeks, while insisting that any higher costs were triggered by policies enacted by Mr Biden, and not his own tariff policies. Consumers have remained frustrated over high grocery prices, which economists say have been fuelled in part by import tariffs and could rise further next year as companies start passing on the full brunt of the import duties. The top Democrat on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal, said the Trump administration was “putting out a fire that they started and claiming it as progress”. “The Trump administration is finally admitting publicly what we’ve all known from the start: Trump’s Trade War is hiking costs on people,” Mr Neal said in a statement. “Since implementing these tariffs, inflation has increased and manufacturing has contracted month after month.” – Reuters",left
"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Tuesday announced lower prices on 15 costly prescription drugs under Medicare, including Ozempic and Wegovy. The price cuts come through the Medicare drug price negotiation program created under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022. It’s different from President Donald Trump’s “most favored nation” drug pricing approach, which relies on executive orders and voluntary deals with drugmakers — not legislation. Trump recently announced such a deal with Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, to lower the price of the drugs in exchange for tariff relief. The Trump administration has been largely quiet about the Medicare price negotiation program. This is the second round of negotiations. Last year, the Biden administration reached deals on 10 prescription drugs, including several for heart disease and diabetes. Those price cuts are set to take effect in 2026. This latest round of price negotiations will go into effect in 2027. “President Trump directed us to stop at nothing to lower health care costs for the American people,” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a news release. “As we work to Make America Healthy Again, we will use every tool at our disposal to deliver affordable health care to seniors.” Drugmakers can choose not to strike deals under the negotiation program, but doing so would most likely mean withdrawing their drugs from Medicare — cutting them off from one of the nation’s largest markets. Drugmakers have challenged the program in court but so far have been unsuccessful. The negotiated prices are what Medicare will pay drugmakers for the medicines, not what patients will pay out of pocket. Those discounts will save taxpayers $12 billion, according to CMS. It’s expected to save Medicare enrollees $685 million in out-of-pocket costs in 2027. Here are the negotiated prices for the drugs, based on a 30-day supply, compared to the 2024 list price: - Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy, for Type 2 diabetes and weight loss: $274 negotiated price, down from the $959 list price. (Negotiated prices for higher doses of Wegovy are $385.) - Trelegy Ellipta, an asthma treatment: $175, down from $654. - Xtandi, for prostate cancer: $7,004, down from $13,480. - Pomalyst, a chemotherapy drug: $8,650, down from $21,744. - Ofev, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: $6,350, down from $12,622. - Ibrance, a breast cancer drug: $7,871, down from $15,741. - Linzess, a chronic constipation drug: $136, down from $539. - Calquence, a cancer drug: $8,600, down from $14,228. - Austedo and Austedo XR, for Huntington’s disease: $4,093, down from $6,623. - Breo Ellipta, a COPD drug: $67, down from $397. - Xifaxan, for diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome: $1,000, down from $2,696. - Vraylar, an antipsychotic drug: $770, down from $1,376. - Tradjenta, a diabetes drug: $78, down from $488. - Janumet and Janumet XR, diabetes drugs: $80, down from $526. - Otezla, a psoriatic arthritis drug: $1,650, down from $4,722. The 15 drugs accounted for $42.5 billion, or 15%, of total Medicare Part D spending in 2024. Medicare Part D covers medications that people take at home, as opposed to those administered in a facility, such as IV chemotherapy. “The price negotiations look very reasonable to me,” said Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. “It should hopefully provide some relief for taxpayers and beneficiaries in the long run.” Dusetzina said the $274 negotiated price for Ozempic and Wegovy is higher than the $250 price in Trump’s deal. “They should’ve gotten that deal for the taxpayers and the Medicare beneficiaries,” she said. The price cuts come as many Americans say the cost of prescription drugs is unaffordable. About 1 in 5 adults say they’ve skipped filling a prescription because it was too expensive, according to a survey published in July by health policy research group KFF. About 1 in 7 say they have cut pills in half or skipped doses of medicine in the last year because of the cost.",left
"Brazilian police crack down on $4.8B tax evasion and money laundering scheme Brazilian police have launched a major operation to dismantle a tax evasion and money-laundering scheme in the fuel sector SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian police launched Thursday a police operation to dismantle a major tax evasion and money-laundering scheme in the fuel sector. The group under investigation is the country’s largest tax debtor, owing more than 26 billion reais ($4.8 billion), authorities said. Local and state authorities are carrying out 126 search and seizure warrants targeting individuals and companies in five states. According to Brazil’s Federal Revenue, the organization used its own companies, investment funds and offshore entities to hide and shield profits. Officials did not name any individuals or companies targeted, but local media reported the operations under investigation involve Grupo Fit, a fuel refinery. Grupo Fit did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said Thursday’s actions stem from a recent crackdown on criminal links to Brazil’s fuel supply chain. In August, authorities flagged 40 fuel-sector investment funds allegedly used to hide assets for members of the First Capital Command crime syndicate, or PCC. PCC is Brazil’s biggest and most powerful organized crime group. It was founded in 1993 by hardened criminals inside Sao Paulo’s Taubate Penitentiary to pressure authorities to improve prison conditions. It quickly started using its power to direct drug dealing and extortion operations on the outside. Over the past few years, the gang has diversified their investment portfolios into various illicit markets. Haddad said that investigations have since identified a pattern of capital flight that included opening investment funds in the United States. Federal authorities said they identified more than 15 U.S.-based offshores sending roughly 1 billion reais ($186 million) back to Brazil to buy equity stakes and real estate. Suspects set up money-laundering operations in Delaware, which the finance minister called “a tax haven in the United States” used for “a serious international triangulation scheme.” One of the group’s latest operations involved 1.2 billion reais ($223 million) sent to funds in the U.S. state, he added. “The scheme works like this: Loans are issued to these funds — loans suspected of never being repaid — and the money then returns to Brazil as supposedly legal investments in economic activities,” Haddad said. “But the money sent abroad is not legitimate.” Haddad said he pledged to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to seek deeper international cooperation with the United States against organized crime and money laundering, amid tariff negotiations with U.S. President Donald Trump. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",left
"Your pasta could get a lot pricier under new tariffs targeting Italian imports — if you can find them at all. Starting as early as January, U.S. tariff rates on imported pasta from 13 major Italian companies could soar to as high as 107% under a preliminary U.S. Commerce Department decision. For consumers in the United States, this means the cost of Italian pasta could more than double if the brands decide to pass tariff costs on to retail buyers. Exporters say the tariffs could effectively bar the targeted Italian companies from selling pasta to U.S. markets. The tariffs mean that exports of pasta to the U.S. “would be virtually wiped out, erasing years of growth and investment along the entire supply chain,” according to a statement from Coldiretti, one of Italy’s largest agricultural organizations. The 13 companies include familiar supermarket labels such as Barilla, La Molisana, Garofalo and Rummo. The preliminary decision issued in September slapped the 13 Italian pasta exporters with a tariff rate of 92%. This would stack on top of the Trump administration’s 15% blanket tariff on exports from the European Union. The Commerce Department alleges that the pasta companies are “dumping” products in the U.S. at “less than normal value.” The additional tariffs, it says, are necessary to level the playing field with American manufacturers. The department, in an email to NBC News after this story's publication, stressed that it was ""not a final determination"" and that ""there has been no increase in rates or cash deposits, and parties still have the opportunity to further participate in the review."" The review of Italian pasta makers that resulted in the decision was launched in August 2024 under the Biden administration. Investigating Italian pasta companies for potential violations of anti-dumping rules is nothing new: The agency has been broadly monitoring the sector since 1996. But the repercussions of this review caught the industry by surprise. As part of its current assessment, the Commerce Department chose two companies for individual review, La Molisana and Garofalo. It further found the two companies “did not provide information” in response to questions about potential dumping. As a result, the department applied what it said were the ""facts available"" and arrived at the additional figure of 92%. That number, the agency said, is ""reasonably reflective"" of the whole group and therefore will be applied to them all. “We are being penalized because of 2 other pasta companies’ failure to supply timely and accurate info,” Rummo USA Chief Commercial Officer Jim Donnelly told NBC News, adding that the company denies allegations of undercutting on pricing. Donnelly said the company would not pull its pasta products, all made in Italy, from U.S. supermarket shelves. But, he said, the company’s pastas, which retail at an average of $3.99, would rise to $6.49 to $7.99 under the higher tariffs. “We will absorb this until this bad ‘cookie cutter judgment’ is fixed. We are confident the government will see this as a big mistake,” Donnelly said. Still, the specter of a 107% tariff already has some pasta lovers thinking about alternative plans. In New York City, chef Salvo Lo Castro said he sells about 200 pounds of pasta a week at his restaurant Casasalvo. From penne to spaghetti to fettuccine, Casasalvo’s menu is nearly all pastas — all at risk of getting two times as expensive for him, and potentially two times as expensive for his customers. After the tariffs were announced, he stopped buying pasta from Italy, and made the move to make his pasta in house. “I don’t want to change the price for my guests, it’s very important,” he said, adding that he doesn’t mind the added time of having his staff make it by hand. For regular consumers, selection at the store could be more expensive if brands raise prices or choose to pull out from the U.S. entirely. But there will still be options, since some Italian brands produce pasta outside of Italy. Barilla, for example, is one of the 13 companies listed. But it also sells pastas in the U.S. that are made in Avon, New York. In a statement, Barilla told NBC News that it “is affected” by the preliminary decision by Commerce, and is “evaluating possible initiatives ahead of the final determination next year.”",left
"The Trump administration said Monday that it will provide only half of the normal food stamp benefits for November by tapping into the program’s contingency fund amid the government shutdown. But recipients are not likely to see the payments immediately. Some $4.65 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s contingency fund will “be obligated to cover 50% of eligible households’ current allotments” for November, according to a sworn statement from a US Department of Agriculture official submitted in federal court. The remaining $600 million in the fund will be used for state administrative expenses and nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico and American Samoa. The decision came after a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the USDA last week to either start providing full November benefits to recipients or partial benefits if the agency opts to only draw on SNAP’s contingency fund. In court papers filed Monday, the administration said it decided against pulling $4 billion from other sources of money to provide full benefits for November. Nearly 42 million Americans receive food stamps, providing households just over $350 a month, on average, as of May, according to the most recent USDA data. The agency’s unprecedented decision to halt benefits has panicked many recipients, driving them to overwhelmed food pantries to help feed themselves and their families. Millions of SNAP recipients started missing their benefits on Saturday, and millions more could find themselves in the same situation over the course of the month, depending on when payments are made. Delayed payments Though the USDA will provide guidance on the partial payments to states on Monday, the agency noted that recipients in some states may not see their November benefits for weeks – or even months, Patrick Penn, the USDA official, told the court. The partial payments will require states to reprogram their systems to adjust for the reduced allotments, which could prove complicated. “Given the variation among State systems, some of which are decades old, it is unclear how many States will complete the changes in an automated manner with minimal disruption versus manual overrides or computations that could lead to payment errors and significant delays,” Penn said. States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. The agency said that it does not have the funds to pay November’s assistance amid the federal government shutdown, which began October 1 States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before SNAP can restart. Providing full benefits for November would be easier and faster, but Penn said the USDA decided against dipping into a pot of money meant to fund child nutrition programs to help cover that cost because it “would leave an unprecedented gap” in that funding source, which ordinarily provides free or low-cost meals for school children, among other things. “USDA has determined that creating a shortfall in Child Nutrition Program funds to fund one month of SNAP benefits is an unacceptable risk … because shifting $4 billion dollars to America’s SNAP population merely shifts the problem to millions of America’s low income children that receive their meals at school,” he wrote. That funding source, which consists of leftover tariff revenue, currently contains nearly $17 billion. Court rulings In his ruling last week, Judge John McConnell, of the federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, gave the administration until 12 p.m. ET on Monday to say what it plans to do. A second federal judge, in Boston, issued a similar order last week, saying the agency was required to use SNAP’s contingency fund to pay at least partial benefits. Both judges said it was up to the agency’s discretion whether to access other money to enable it to provide full payments. The USDA had maintained that it could not tap into its contingency fund, stating in a memo that “contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.” Also, it noted that the contingency funds are meant to pay food benefits in the case of natural disasters. President Donald Trump indicated Friday evening that he wants benefits to resume, posting on Truth Social that he instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible because the attorneys “do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available.” “Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump wrote. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.” The administration has opted to draw on the leftover tariff funds to fund other priorities. The USDA last month transferred $300 million from that pot in order to temporarily continue providing WIC food assistance for pregnant women, new moms and young children. The decision to halt benefits prompted a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, to file a lawsuit in Boston on Tuesday and a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses to bring the case in Rhode Island on Thursday. Democracy Forward, which represents the plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case, said on Monday that it wasn’t satisfied with the administration’s decision to make only partial SNAP payments and that it is “considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.” “It shouldn’t take a court order to force our President to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,” said Skye Perryman, the group’s president and CEO, in a statement. “Rest assured, we will continue to fight so that people have the full benefits they are entitled to under SNAP.”",left
"China's factory activity contracts for 8th month in November despite trade war truce China’s factory activity contracted for the eighth straight month in November, according to an official survey on Sunday, underscoring challenges for the country’s economy despite the U.S.-China trade truce HONG KONG -- China’s factory activity contracted for the eighth straight month in November, according to an official survey on Sunday, underscoring challenges for the country’s economy despite the U.S.-China trade truce. The official manufacturing purchasing managers index rose slightly to 49.2 in November from 49 in October, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said. The PMI is measured on a scale between 0 and 100, with a reading below 50 indicating contraction. The contraction was in line with analyst expectations. A U.S. tariff cut earlier this month likely would mean that Chinese exports could gain competitiveness in the U.S. market, but it may be too early to say whether exports have regained momentum following the trade truce. U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. would cut its tariffs on Chinese goods after meeting Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea on Oct. 30, raising some optimism over Chinese exports and manufacturing. A prolonged slump in China’s property market and falling home prices are still hurting consumer confidence, and real estate investments have been down. Intense price competition domestically in many sectors including the auto industry have also put pressure on many businesses. More government policy support is required to help boost the economy, economists said. But “policymakers appear to be delaying further policy support,” Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING bank, wrote in a note earlier this month. While Chinese authorities previously rolled out measures such as trade-in subsidies for home appliances and electric vehicles, some of these subsidies are set to be phased out, and sales and demand are likely to drop, analysts said. The fading boost from the consumer goods trade-in policies may be weighing on domestic demand for manufactured goods and “signals on domestic demand have been mixed,” said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, last week. Chinese officials have set a target of around 5% economic growth for the whole of 2025. The economy expanded 4.8% in the July-September quarter. “This year’s growth target is likely to require minimal additional support to be reached,” Song wrote.",left
"Despite the never-ending drama over whether to ban the app, President Donald Trump’s volatile tariff regime, and executive shake-ups, TikTok’s ecommerce division is still seeing massive growth. TikTok doesn’t disclose aggregate sales figures, but the price and sales volume of individual products are visible on the app. Based on that data, the analytics firm EchoTik estimates TikTok Shop sold $19 billion worth of products globally from July through September of this year. The United States, its largest market, accounted for $4 billion to $4.5 billion in sales, an increase of about 125 percent compared to the second quarter of 2025. To put those numbers into perspective, consider that TikTok Shop is now on the same scale as eBay, which saw $20.1 billion in total sales in the last quarter. TikTok Shop only launched in the US in September 2023, while eBay has been around for over 30 years. That speed of growth is remarkable. “We have mostly focused on TikTok from this point of view of the TikTok ban, and we have almost forgotten that TikTok Shop’s share in US ecommerce just continues to grow slowly,” says Juozas Kaziukėnas, an independent ecommerce analyst. What You See Is What You Get TikTok Shop broke into the extremely saturated ecommerce landscape in the US by excelling at an age-old platitude: show, don’t tell. Creators post short videos on TikTok trying on clothes or using home gadgets and include links to buy the products on the same platform. It creates a much more straightforward experience for consumers, who can see real people testing products instead of needing to wade through written reviews on traditional ecommerce sites. Ivy Yang, the founder of Wavelet Strategy, a strategic public relations consultancy, says she recently bought a dust-mite-removing vacuum on Amazon shortly before she scrolled past a TikTok Shop video featuring a similar product. She quickly realized the TikTok Shop version had more features, so she ordered it, tried it out, and returned the one from Amazon. To her, that’s the appeal of shopping on TikTok. “I need to see how it works in action,” Yang explains. In theory, that’s what makes livestream shopping even more popular, at least in China, because now influencers can tout products on camera in real time, and there’s little editing involved that might mask any potential product defects. In recent years, livestream shopping has completely reshaped how people buy things in China and has become one of ByteDance’s main revenue pillars. But despite how hard TikTok has tried, it simply hasn’t been able to replicate that success in the US. Kaziukėnas says that TikTok Shop’s performance likely still falls short of ByteDance’s expectations, especially when it comes to livestream shopping. Compared with China, TikTok Shop’s livestream sales in the US remain minuscule. Dandan He, the CEO of CHC Fashion Group, a company in New York that hosts TikTok livestreams for US sellers, broke it down this way: In the US, roughly 80 percent of TikTok users are on the app to consume entertainment, while the other 20 percent are watching shopping-related content. Among that 20 percent, only about one out of 10 are watching livestreams. That means in total, just 2 percent of TikTok traffic in the US goes to livestream shopping content. But in China, “livestream ecommerce accounts for nearly 50 percent of all Douyin traffic,” says He, referring to the Chinese version of TikTok. TikTok declined to share precise sales figures for TikTok Shop. In an email, company spokesperson Kathryn Hull said that TikTok Shop live shopping sessions were up 72 percent year over year in September, and sales were up 120 percent year over year in June. Will Americans Ever Adopt Livestream Shopping? I’ve been reporting on Chinese platforms’ attempts to bring livestream shopping to the US since 2020, and I have to say, I’m getting more and more skeptical of their ability to succeed. Part of the problem is that livestream ecommerce content on TikTok today is magnitudes more boring than what Chinese consumers are watching on Douyin, says Yang. Many in the West still treat TikTok live as QVC in vertical format, but young people aren’t interested in watching QVC remade for phone screens. In China, many top shopping livestreams function like variety shows, featuring comedy, sensational stunts, and celebrities. In China, “there's this sense of novelty: ‘Oh my god, it's literally a public intellectual selling me facemasks.’ That is innovation. Can you imagine Taylor Swift or Travis Kelce going on livestream and selling things to you here? That would not happen,” Yang says. Another issue is that livestreaming on TikTok Shop is still a strategy primarily used by Chinese brands selling to overseas markets, and they often struggle to overcome cultural and language barriers to create content that American consumers actually want to watch. Felicity Zhang, a Houston-based TikTok Shop seller originally from China, has seen this firsthand. She previously worked at TikTok recruiting and training livestreamers but now runs her own brand on the platform. She says TikTok Shop has so many China-based sellers that “when you scroll the livestreams, it feels like you are in Yiwu,” a Chinese manufacturing hub known for producing plastic knickknacks. TikTok has been tightening its merchant registration rules to limit the influx of overseas sellers, Zhang says, but that has also ironically made it harder for genuine small American businesses to get onboard, further slowing domestic adoption. Hull, the TikTok’ spokesperson said the platform carefully vets merchants on TikTok Shop and declined 1.4 million new seller applications in the first half of 2025, but she did not address whether the rules were designed to screen out non-US sellers. Breakthrough in Southeast Asia Overall, TikTok Shop is doing much better in Southeast Asia than in the US. TikTok Shop’s top-performing markets in the third quarter (aside from the US) were Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines. None of these countries is outselling the US individually, but combined, they represent a bigger success story for TikTok, particularly because livestream ecommerce is resonating more there with consumers. In October, one Thai influencer sold over $17 million worth of products, mostly cosmetics and supplements, during a six-day TikTok broadcast marathon during which she invited many Thai celebrities to appear on camera. “It’s now mainstream across Thailand and Southeast Asia,” says Warin Tinprapa, the chief growth officer at MI Group, a Thai social media marketing agency. The livestream shopping model “fits perfectly with the region’s shopping-as-entertainment culture and mobile-first habits,” she says. There are plenty of reasons why Southeast Asia has proved to be a better fit for TikTok Shop. First, consumer behavior in the region more closely mirrors that of China. Competition from local companies and tech giants like Amazon is also less intense, and TikTok’s low-price strategy fits with local consumption habits. The Last Hope The one major takeaway from all my conversations is that TikTok Shop in the US is fundamentally different from what Douyin is in China. But TikTok has found new strategies that have allowed it to steadily embed itself into the American shopping market. None of the other platforms are investing as many resources into cultivating social commerce, to the point that TikTok users often complain about being fed too much shopping content on their For You Page. For sellers, this means they should keep utilizing TikTok’s original content format—short videos—to drive traffic to their products. He, who runs the New York–based TikTok ecommerce agency, says that while her company started out focusing mostly on livestreaming, it now puts half its efforts into producing short videos. But she’s not willing to give up on livestreaming yet. Her hope is that as TikTok continues to grow as a social media platform, that 2 percent of traffic directed to livestream ecommerce will eventually become a significant revenue source, and her company will be ready before everyone else. “The reason we have persisted till now is to see when the livestream ecommerce traffic in the US can catch up with that in China. We are betting on the future,” she says. This is an edition of Zeyi Yang and Louise Matsakis’ Made in China newsletter. Read previous newsletters here.",left
"Why Black Friday discounts could be stingier this year Businesses face a tough decision this holiday season: Run a Black Friday promotion and see their profits drop, or charge full price and risk turning off buyers. Some business owners said sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports are raising their costs, giving them less room to roll out aggressive holiday sales. Lisa Cheng Smith, founder of Yun Hai Taiwanese Pantry, a New York City-based retailer that imports products from businesses and farms in Taiwan, said her costs have jumped 20% to 50% this year from 2024 because of U.S. tariffs on imports from Taiwan and other Asian countries. In past years, Yun Hai has offered a 15% Black Friday discount as a way to drive holiday purchases, with Cheng Smith telling CBS News that the annual promotion ""is a really important thing for us."" This year, however, she's unsure how much of a discount she can afford to offer, given her higher operational costs resulting from tariffs. ""It's complicated because of tariffs and how the retail math works,"" Cheng Smith said. ""Do we offer less of a discount and try to preserve margins, or do we use the same promotion language and structures that customers have come to expect?"" For small business owners, such calculations can make all the difference, she added. ""What we do from October through December is equal to the whole rest of the year in terms of sales, so every day is more high stakes,"" she noted. Retail experts said higher tariff costs for retailers and other businesses could mean fewer, and paltrier, Black Friday discounts this year. ""There will be discounts and deals — that's what Black Friday is about. Very few retailers will want to shun that completely, but I think they will be more surgical and selective in the discounting,"" Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. ""They will perhaps discount fewer items, and some discounts will be less generous in terms of the amount of money off."" Dan Peskorse, whose company, Upstream Brands, sells a range of merchandise under different labels on Amazon and other e-commerce sites, also said higher tariff costs are forcing him to rethink his Black Friday strategy this year. For previous Black Fridays, Peskorse said Upstream Brands typically offered discounts of up to 30% on products sold under the company's flagship brands, including ThinkFit, which makes meal-prep bags and containers, and Ash Harbor, a maker of small home goods. Not this year. ""This is the first year that we are not offering across-the-board discounts on products,"" he said, noting that the decision was ""100%"" related to tariffs. Peskorse has taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including raising prices and absorbing the extra costs that come with importing goods from China and India. The only tool he has left to control costs and preserve his business's profits is to scrap discounts, he said. The average U.S. tariff rate has increased sevenfold this year, to 16.6%, according to EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. Those higher duties are pushing up the prices of imported goods as retailers pass on a portion of the costs to shoppers, he noted. ""It's going to be a strange season"" Squeezed by tariff costs, many businesses are also grappling with a slowdown in holiday spending by lower-income consumers still feeling the impact of persistent inflation. ""I think the rubber is going to hit the road when we get into Black Friday,"" said Sonia Lapinsky, a retail analyst at management consulting firm AlixPartners. ""Consumers are telling us they are pulling back on holiday spending this year, holding on to their dollars and putting their money in critical places, not in discretionary buckets."" Discounts are a powerful tool for incentivizing consumers to spend money, she added. ""It's the only way retailers will get them in the door, because they can't stomach this,"" Lapinsky said. ""So it's going to be a strange season. If retailers get it wrong, they're risking the biggest selling season they have.""",left
"John Singer Sargent’s parents, Mary Newbold Singer and Fitzwilliam Sargent, left Philadelphia in 1853 to recover from the tragic death of their first child. They wandered around Europe, living frugally on savings and inherited money. The future painter was born in Florence in 1856, followed later by his sisters, Emily and Violet. The children followed their mother on drawing expeditions, and much of their informal education took place in museums. John showed such talent that his parents accompanied him to Paris in 1874 to help him find a suitable teacher. The young man’s refined manners and fluent French enabled him to penetrate French society in a way few Americans did. The story of his formative decade in Paris, from 1874 until 1884, is told in the sumptuous exhibition Sargent: Dazzling Paris, at the Musée d’Orsay in the city. (It debuted at the Metropolitan Museum, in New York, in April.) READ MORE The Salon was the biggest exhibition of contemporary art in Europe, held annually at the Palais de l’Industrie on the Champs-Élysées. At the Salon, the Sargents chose Carolus-Duran, portrait painter to the grande bourgeoisie, because he was considered innovative without being controversial. Sargent’s impressive portfolio, much of which is shown in the exhibition, won him entry to the Académie des Beaux Arts as well as to Carolus-Duran’s studio. When his portrait of Carolus-Duran was shown at the Salon in 1879, critics said the student had surpassed the master. L’Écho de Bruxelles declared Sargent “American by birth, French by his paintbrush”. Sargent and his family resembled the American expatriates who people the novels of his friend Henry James, so steeped in European culture that they could no longer live in the United States. Oscar Wilde’s aphorism that “when good Americans die they go to Paris” captured the yearning for civilisation that sent affluent late-19th-century Americans flocking across the Atlantic. Sargent’s sitters included writers, painters, composers and American heiresses who married European noblemen for their titles. His canvases convey dramatic tension and a sense of mystery. They have a literary and theatrical aura, prompting the viewer to wonder what has happened and what is going to happen. Sargent’s portraits of children are particularly effective. In 1880-81 he painted Édouard and Marie-Louise Pailleron, aged 15 and 10. Their sour expressions, Marie-Louise explained in her memoir, were the result of posing through 83 sessions with Sargent. The painting is often used as a cover for The Turn of the Screw, James’s Gothic horror novella about children who commune with malevolent ghosts. The following year Sargent painted the daughters of Edward Darley Boit, a Boston lawyer who brought his family to Paris in the hope of becoming an artist. The daughters pose in the darkened entry of their expatriate parents’ apartment. Three girls stare at the viewer. The fourth leans against a large Japanese urn that dwarfs her. The painting is a visual allusion to Velázquez’s Las Meninas and bears a striking resemblance to The Artist’s Studio, by Sargent’s friend John Lavery, the Irish painter. “Both painters were born in 1856. They corresponded, knew each other and each other’s work, and had a lot in common stylistically,” Caroline Campbell, director of the National Gallery of Ireland, says. In the US and Britain, Sargent came to be considered the greatest portrait painter of his generation. But in Paris, where he first achieved fame, he was largely forgotten. The Musée d’Orsay’s exhibition is the first monographic show of his work in France. In Paris, Sargent was not yet the painter of rich Americans and British aristocrats. Early works portrayed unfortunate souls, one a beggar girl, another a gypsy, with compassion. Unlike French contemporaries, he made no effort to record the modern city. In his only Parisian scene, a fashionable couple walk through the Luxembourg Gardens under a full moon at twilight. Sargent continued to travel, using Paris as his base. He painted Breton women in wooden clogs and barefoot children on the beach in Setting Out to Fish. That painting, like the sun-dappled table beneath an outdoor canopy in The Wineglasses, could have been painted by his Spanish painter friend Joaquin Sorolla, whose work was exhibited alongside Sargent’s at the Petit Palais in 2007. Sargent’s bucolic painting of Rosina Ferrara, a local beauty, in Among the Olive Trees in Capri is a tribute to Corot. Smoke of Ambergris, painted in various shades of white, shows a young Moroccan woman permeating her clothes with incense. Sargent approached Virginie Gautreau, a famed Paris beauty, through a mutual acquaintance. “I have a great desire to paint her portrait and have reason to think she would allow it and is waiting for someone to propose this homage to her beauty,” he wrote. “You might tell her that I am a man of prodigious talent.” Gautreau accepted and the two became friends. Unusually for him, Sargent completed numerous studies, and worked on the painting for weeks at Gautreau’s country house in Brittany. It shows her clad in a low-cut, sheath-like black gown, standing haughtily with one hand on the edge of a table, her face turned in profile. When the portrait was completed, Gautreau wrote to a friend calling it a masterpiece. Stephanie Herdrich, who co-curated the exhibition for the Metropolitan, says Gautreau was “a modern-day celebrity” whose activities were covered by French newspapers. “She was known for her elaborate gowns, for painting her skin with lavender powder to make it look paler, for dying her hair with henna and painting on her eyebrows. Sargent saw her as a self-created work of art.” Sargent knew the portrait was provocative, but he was stunned by the uproar it caused when the Salon opened in 1884. “People gathered around the portrait in shock, criticising the portrait but mostly criticising the sitter and her appearance,” Herdrich says. The critic Joséphin Péladan wrote that the portrait was “Interesting for her ugliness ... Her décolletage adorned with silver chains ... is indecent and gives the impression of a dress about to slip ... The pearly whiteness gives her skin a bluish hue – cadaverous and clownish at once.” Gautreau and her mother begged Sargent to withdraw the portrait from the exhibition. He declined, but when he took it back to his studio he repainted the chain strap falling off Gautreau’s shoulder in the upright position. “It was an obvious acknowledgment of the scandal, a capitulation,” Herdrich says. France has always been considered a country of sexual permissiveness, and it seems odd that a portrait of a woman in evening dress could cause such a furore, especially 21 years after Manet’s Olympia showed a naked prostitute receiving a bouquet from an admirer. “It was a period of tension between conservative forces and the avant-garde, so there were a lot of artistic scandals,” says Pascal Perrin of the Musée d’Orsay, chief curator of the exhibition. “Eroticism was possible in painting but not in a portrait. Gautreau was a strong, self-confident woman, and portraits of women were supposed to show the husband’s success, not the woman’s personality.” Both curators detect an undercurrent of anti-Americanism. Gautreau’s French parents had emigrated to Louisiana, where they owned a plantation. Her father died fighting on the Confederate side in the War of Secession, and her mother brought her to Paris at the age of eight. She attended French schools and married a French businessman twice her age. “A French woman might have got away with it, but since French society considered Gautreau American, the portrait was seen as vulgar,” Perrin says. “The collaboration between these two young Americans seeking celebrity in Paris ruffled feathers,” Herdrich says. Sargent was 28, Gautreau 25. “It was a period of a huge infiltration of foreigners into France, of tariff battles and anti-American sentiment, of robber barons and the acquisition of immense wealth in the US. There are parallels with today.” It was not customary to identify sitters, so the portrait was originally entitled Madame ***, though everyone recognised Gautreau. Sargent was bruised by the outcry and kept the painting behind a curtain in his studio, where people queued to see it. Gautreau died in 1915. The following year he sold the portrait to the Metropolitan Museum, saying it was “the best thing I have done”. Sargent had earlier painted Dr Samuel Pozzi, a well-known Parisian gynaecologist, in the unconventional setting of Pozzi’s home, in his dressing gown. The painting is a study in reds, echoing Velázquez’s portrait of Pope Innocent X. Pozzi was a pillar of French society who revolutionised hospital hygiene and wrote a gynaecology text that remained a reference for half a century. Sargent’s portrait of Pozzi inspired the British novelist Julian Barnes to write The Man in the Red Coat, his 2019 book. Pozzi was tall and slim from practising fencing, his favourite sport. He had numerous affairs, including a decade-long tryst with the actor Sarah Bernhardt, who addressed him as Dr God. Sargent sent the portrait for exhibition at the Royal Academy in London, and showed it in Brussels, but never in Paris, perhaps to avoid scandal. Men increasingly adopted more feminine clothes and manners in the late 19th century. Pozzi wears a ruffled white shirt beneath the dressing gown. His long, elegant fingers toy with the belt. The mischievousness of the portrait derives from its ambiguity. Sargent was discreet about his own sexuality, but he is assumed to have been gay or bisexual. The sensuous male nudes of his early years can be seen in the exhibition. After Sargent’s death, the painter Jacques-Émile Blanche wrote that Sargent’s sex life “was notorious in Paris, and in Venice, positively scandalous.” “When I look at Sargent’s work I see the work of a queer artist,” the design journalist and photographer Mark O’Flaherty said in the documentary John Singer Sargent: Fashion & Swagger, made to coincide with recent Sargent shows in Boston and London. “His obsession with fashion, the mannerisms and his interest in shaping fabric mark him out as a gay man immediately, and the way he manipulates the clothes and the way he makes his subjects stand, using these overtly effeminate and camp gestures.” Many of Sargent’s friends were gay. The exhibition includes a hastily executed, vibrant portrait of his long-time friend Violet Paget, a French-born British feminist and lesbian writer who worked under the name Vernon Lee. Sargent commuted between Paris and London for two years after the Madame X scandal. Encouraged by Henry James, he settled permanently in London from 1886. The British initially thought him too “Frenchified”, but his 1887 painting of two English girls lighting lanterns in a garden, Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose triumphed at the Royal Academy and was purchased by the Tate Gallery. Sargent nonetheless stayed in touch with France, particularly with his friend Claude Monet, whom he painted in impressionist style. “I deeply regret that I shall have nothing for the Salon,” he wrote to Monet in 1887. “I really do not want to be forgotten in Paris. It would upset me if I were considered a poor idiot, who has ceased to exhibit there to make a statement. I beg you, if you hear from our friends that I am a deserter or an ingrate, or that I am sulking, to contradict such nonsense.” In 1889, Monet and Sargent worked together to purchase Manet’s Olympia for the French state. That year Sargent exhibited with the US section at the Paris World’s Fair. France awarded him the Legion of Honour. His 1892 painting of the Spanish dancer Carmencita was bought by the Musée du Luxembourg, in Paris, the state-owned “museum of living artists”. Sargent continued to exhibit in the Salon until 1905 and to visit France until 1918. He always considered himself American, declined a knighthood and died in London in 1925, a book by Voltaire in his hand. He was buried in Surrey. Sargent’s painting had gone out of fashion. Only one French newspaper, Le Gaulois, put his death on its front page: “This American born in Florence, who loved France and lived in London, had in his youth declared himself to be one of ours.” John Singer Sargent: Dazzling Paris is at the Musée d’Orsay, in Paris, until January 11th, 2026",left
"Senators struck an agreement Sunday night, projecting confidence that it will be sufficient to end the lengthy U.S. government shutdown, three sources with direct knowledge of the details told NBC News. The agreement, reached by a group of Democrats who teamed up with Republicans, cleared the first hurdle on a vote of 60-40 to advance in a late-night Senate vote. If it’s approved, it would then need to pass the House and gain President Donald Trump’s signature to become law and reopen the government. Even if it has enough support to clear those hurdles, the process is expected to take days. The deal funds the government through Jan. 30, would fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and reverses attempted layoffs of federal workers. But in a major concession from Democrats, it does not include an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies.

Ghislaine Maxwell's prison emails show she is 'happier' at minimum-security Texas facility Within days of her arrival at a Texas prison camp in early August, Ghislaine Maxwell gushed in emails to her friends and family over the cleanliness and safety of her new surroundings. “The institution is run in an orderly fashion which makes for a safer more comfortable environment for all people concerned, inmates and guards alike,” Maxwell wrote. NBC News has reviewed emails, obtained by the House Judiciary Committee, that were sent by the Jeffrey Epstein accomplice during her first few months at Federal Prison Camp Bryan, where she was moved days after meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche this summer. One photo, a deluge of threats: Inside the Arizona high school turned upside down by right-wing activists A group of Arizona high school teachers — some of whom were fans of Charlie Kirk — had their lives turned upside down this week over false accusations about a Halloween photo. In the photo, Cienega High School math teachers wore matching white T-shirts on Halloween stained with red blotches and reading “Problem Solved.” Right-wing influencers were claiming that the educators were mocking conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Though the district quickly announced the shirts were a math joke and unrelated to Kirk, conservatives and some Republican officials from around the country amplified the image and portrayed it as a glorification of political violence. In the following days, the high school and its staff received more than 3,000 hateful messages, including dozens of death threats, and so many obscene calls that they disconnected the phones. Teachers stayed home. Sheriff’s deputies stepped up patrols on campus. Confused students asked if they were safe at school. The disruption reminded Vail School District Superintendent John Carruth of a cyberattack, which the district has dealt with before. “Except instead of bots, it’s people,” he said. 'Wicked: For Good' director Jon M. Chu discusses the importance of identity in his films “Wicked: For Good” director Jon M. Chu has built his career on turning stories about outsiders into celebrations of belonging. But in an interview with “Meet the Press,” the filmmaker opened up about following his own yellow brick road: one marked by rejection and resilience. “My whole life, I’ve been trying to prove myself, that I can be here, that I can be in this business,” Chu told moderator Kristen Welker. “And I think I was always searching for that kind of validation. But through the process of making movies and doing it over — and I had a whole long career before ever doing ‘Wicked’ — I think I got killed many times.” “Wicked: For Good,” the second chapter in his adaptation of the hit Broadway musical, will hit theaters on Nov. 21. It is loosely based on Gregory Maguire’s 1995 novel — a creative reimagining of “The Wizard of Oz.” Feds accuse 2 Cleveland Guardians players of rigging pitches in betting scheme Federal prosecutors charged two Cleveland Guardians pitchers with allegedly rigging their pitches in a sports betting scheme that “betrayed America’s pastime,” U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. said. Emmanuel Clase de la Cruz, 27, and Luis Leandro Ortiz Ribera, 26, allegedly worked with co-conspirators to place bets on their performance to rake in roughly $450,000 over two years, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. The prosecutor’s office released a previously sealed complaint against the two men accusing them of defrauding sports betting platforms. Both men are charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy. According to the unsealed complaint, the alleged scheme began with Clase and two unidentified “bettors” in May 2023.

"Democrats sweep key races in 2025 elections in early referendum on Trump What to know about Election Day 2025 - Democrats scored victories in the four major races of the night: the New York City mayoral race, the governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia and Prop 50, California's redistricting ballot measure. Exit polling showed voters went to the polls with worries about the economy on their minds, coupled with broader discontent with the state of the country right now. - The night saw two kinds of Democrats win, hailing from opposite sides of the party. Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, both moderates, won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia, while on the far left, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani prevailed in his race for New York mayor over the state's moderate ex-governor, Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent after Mamdani beat him in the primary. - The first person Mamdani quoted in his victory speech was socialist Eugene Debs, and he offered withering criticism of Cuomo, declaring, ""Let tonight be the final time I utter his name, as we turn the page on a politics that abandons the many and answers only to the few."" - California voters said ""yes"" to Proposition 50, which will allow state legislators to redistrict before the midterm elections, an effort to counter GOP-led gerrymandering in other states. CBS News' polling found those who support Prop 50 overwhelmingly cite opposition to the Trump administration as a reason. - Watch CBS News 24/7 streaming coverage for the latest developments. And you can go deeper with analysis and opinion from The Free Press, a Paramount publication. Trump's takeaway from election results is Republicans ""have to talk about"" successes A day after Republicans faced losses in several states, President Trump said Wednesday he believes his party needs to talk more about affordability — including the successes he believes he's had with containing energy prices and inflation. ""It's no good if we do a great job and you don't talk about it, and I don't think they talk about it enough,"" he told Fox News' Bret Baier. The president seemed more surprised by Republican Jack Ciattarelli's loss in the New Jersey governor's race than GOP gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears' loss in Virginia. ""I thought New Jersey would do a little bit better than that,"" Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump endorsed Ciattarelli but not Earle-Sears, which he pointed out in the interview Wednesday, saying the Virginian ""didn't really have my support, my big support."" ""My endorsement means a lot to me,"" he said. Trump warns Mamdani: ""I think he should be very nice to me"" President Trump called Mamdani's victory speech in the New York City mayoral race — which included several jabs at the president — ""very angry."" ""I think he should be very nice to me,"" the president told Fox News' Bret Baier. ""You know, I'm the one that sort of has to approve a lot of things coming to him, so he's off to a bad start."" Mr. Trump continued: ""He has to be a little bit respectful of Washington because if he's not, he doesn't have a chance of succeeding."" Before Tuesday's election, the president had suggested he may withhold federal funding to New York City if Mamdani won. ""It's going to be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York. Because if you have a communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there,"" he said in an interview with ""60 Minutes."" Mamdani has described himself as a democratic socialist, not a communist. Trump sends message for 2026 midterm elections: A ""choice between communism and common sense"" In remarks to the America Business Forum in Miami, Mr. Trump suggested the outcome of Tuesday's elections would mean Americans would face a stark choice. He sought to portray Mamdani's victory as one that defines Democrats, although he did not mention the New York City mayor-elect by name. ""After last night's results, the decision facing all Americans could not be more clear. We have a choice between communism and common sense,"" he said. ""… Our opponents are offering an economic nightmare, we're delivering an economic miracle."" ""They want higher spending for government and illegal aliens, we want bigger paychecks for American workers and American families, and that's what we're delivering, you see that. They stand for crime and chaos and corruption, we stand for law and order and justice. Also, strong borders."" Mr. Trump said New Yorkers voting for mayor had a choice between a ""communist"" and ""thug."" Mr. Trump has frequently referred to Mamdani, a democratic socialist, as a communist. ""I said they were voting last night, you could have a communist or a thug. A communist — and they took the communist,"" he said. Trump says ""we lost a little bit of sovereignty last night in New York, but we'll take care of it"" Mr. Trump opened his remarks to the America Business Forum in Miami by reminiscing about his 2024 election win and campaign and making a brief reference to New York City's election results. ""On Nov. 5, 2024, the American people reclaimed our government. We restored our sovereignty — we lost a little bit of sovereignty last night in New York, but we'll take care of it, don't worry about it,"" he said. ""We rescued our economy, regained our liberty, and together, we saved our country."" Before the election, Mr. Trump had encouraged Republicans in New York to vote for former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whom he found to be a more palatable option than Mamdani. Cuomo was running as an independent after Mamdani defeated him in the Democratic primary. After Tuesday's losses, White House social media focuses on Trump's 2024 win After Republican losses on Tuesday, which Mr. Trump himself said were not good for Republicans, the official White House X account on Wednesday was focused on Mr. Trump's 2024 election victory, one year ago to date. ""ONE YEAR AGO, HISTORY WAS MADE,"" one of the multiple posts about 2024 said. ""45 BECAME 47. THE MOVEMENT ROARED BACK."" ONE YEAR SINCE THE GREATEST COMEBACK IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY,"" another White House post on X said. ""THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA IS HERE TO STAY."" ""Happy Anniversary! On this day, Nov 5th, one year ago, we had one of the Greatest Presidential Victories in History — Such an Honor to represent our Country,"" another X post said. ""Our Economy is BOOMING, & Costs are coming way down. Affordability is our goal. Love to the American People!"" Other White House posts on X focused on the promises Mr. Trump made that the White House said he's kept. California GOP to challenge redrawn congressional districts approved by voters in Prop 50 redistricting measure The California Republican Party said Wednesday it will sue to challenge the new congressional map approved by voters under Proposition 50. The Dhillon Law Group, Assemblyman David Tangipa (R-Fresno), and other California GOP leaders announced the lawsuit the morning after Election Day. Jeffries says affordability was ""the decisive issue,"" voters showed ""extraordinary rejection"" of Trump's ""extremism"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat who endorsed Zohran Mamdani shortly before the election, said affordability was ""definitely the decisive issue"" in Tuesday's elections and that Democratic candidates ""leaned in aggressively on driving down the high cost of living and addressing the affordability crisis,"" which helped cement their wins. ""Donald Trump promised lower costs on Day One, but costs haven't gone down,"" Jeffries said during a news conference Wednesday afternoon. ""Costs are going up."" Jeffries criticized President Trump's tariffs for driving up costs for Americans, who are already struggling with the high costs of housing, food and electricity. Jeffries said Republicans' refusal to negotiate on Affordable Care Act subsidies, which expire at the end of the year, further harms Americans. The Democratic leader said the elections show ""an extraordinary rejection"" of Mr. Trump's ""extremism."" ""Republicans woke up this morning and realized that they are no longer in a 2024 electoral environment. That's over, and they're done. They've lost any temporary progress that they've made with working class Americans — gone. Any progress that they've made with the Hispanic community —gone. Any progress that they've made with younger Americans — gone,"" he said. Jacob Frey wins Minneapolis mayor's race Incumbent Jacob Frey is projected to win the Minneapolis mayoral election, where he'll serve his third term as the leader of the state's largest city. Minneapolis election officials say Frey won with 50% of the vote, with his closest challenger, state Sen. Omar Fateh, earning 44%. The results are unofficial, and must still be verified. Despite challenges from a bloc of candidates that included Fateh, Rev. DeWayne Davis and Jazz Hampton, Frey was able to withstand the challenges of ranked-choice voting. He won after two rounds of tabulation, but the Democrat has never won on the first ballot. When he was first elected in 2017, it took six rounds to declare Frey the winner. In 2021, he won after the second round. Frey, 44, has guided the city through the unrest that followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. — Aki Nance Schumer says he spoke with Mamdani this morning and congratulated him on a ""very, very good campaign"" Schumer, who did not endorse Mamdani, was asked about a criticism from progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that the Democratic Party cannot succeed in the future without embracing young progressive candidates. ""Listen, I'm moving forward,"" Schumer responded. ""This morning, I talked with Mayor-elect Mamdani. We had a very, very good conversation. We said that we cared about New York City. And that we look forward to working together to help the city and improve the city. I congratulated him on running a very, very good campaign. And the issue that he has stressed is being stressed by Democrats across the country from one end of the country to the other — the high costs that the Trump administration is imposing on us and their failure to do anything about it."" Schumer says ""last night was a shellacking for the Republicans and for Donald Trump"" Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Schumer called Tuesday night's elections a ""shellacking"" for Mr. Trump and the GOP and said the election results should be a ""five-alarm fire"" for Republicans. ""Last night was a shellacking for the Republicans and for Donald Trump,"" Schumer said. ""Last night was clear, unmistakeable, as a repudiation of Trump and a vindication of what Democrats have been fighting for over the last several months and all year. Americans have been feeling the real-world repercussions of Trump's policies for months. They're having trouble paying their bills. And now, this month, as they're getting their health care insurance premium vouchers, they're just scared to death of how they're going to pay it."" ""And they know that Democrats are fighting for them and Republicans are doing nothing, nothing to address the health care crisis,"" Schumer added. ""And last night, Republicans felt the political repercussions. It should serve nothing short of a five-alarm fire to the Republicans."" ""I don't think the loss last night was any reflection about Republicans at all,"" Johnson says House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday morning downplayed the Democratic sweep the night before, saying ""what happened last night was blue states and blue cities voted blue."" ""We all saw that coming, and no one should read too much into last night's election results,"" Johnson said. ""Off-year elections are not indicative of what's to come."" When asked about Mr. Trump's social media post Tuesday night in which he said the shutdown played a factor into Republican losses, Johnson said, ""I don't think the loss last night was any reflection about Republicans at all."" —Jaala Brown Mamdani says he would be ""interested"" in having conversation with Trump about ""ways we could work together to serve New Yorkers"" Mamdani said Wednesday that the White House hasn't reached out to congratulate him, but he said he would be ""interested"" in speaking with President Trump. ""I continue to be interested in having a conversation with President Trump on the ways we can work together to serve New Yorkers, whether that be delivering on his campaign promises around cost of living or the many issues that New Yorkers have been sharing with me about the drastic impacts that the legislation that President Trump has ushered through Washington will mean for them and their lives,"" Mamdani said. Mamdani specifically noted that he would like to talk to Mr. Trump about SNAP benefits. ""I look forward to having these conversations and to making clear that if there is ever anything to be spoken about that could benefit the people of the city, I am ready and willing to speak to anyone about it,"" Mamdani said. ""But if it is a conversation to come at the expense of those people, then I will fight that idea tooth and nail because my job is to serve this city."" Mamdani says ""the beautiful prose of campaigning has begun"" New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is giving his first press conference since Tuesday's election, saying he will ""work to make sure the handover"" from current Mayor Eric Adams is a ""seamless one."" ""The poetry of campaigning may have come to a close last night at 9 p.m., but the beautiful prose of governing has only just begun. The hard work of improving New Yorkers lives starts now,"" Mamdani said. Mamdani said he will be forming his administration, including deputy mayors and commissioners in the near future. Mamdani announced Elana Leopold will lead his transition team, joined by former FTC Commissioner Lena Khan, former First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer, United Way CEO Grace Bonilla, and former Deputy Mayor Melanie Hartzog. ""I am looking forward to every member of our coalition being a part of the transition,"" Mamdani said. Mamdani says he's ""looking forward to showing the power of an example"" Appearing on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Mamdani was asked about Republicans making him the poster boy for the Democratic Party. ""I am looking forward to showing the power of an example … of what it means to not just diagnose the despair in working people's lives as the cost-of-living crisis, but to deliver on it,"" Mamdani said. ""And that's the contrast between myself and President Trump,"" he added. Mamdani said he would stand up to the administration by ""utilizing the courts"" when necessary. Recognizing his message did not resonate with all voters during the campaign, Mamdani said, ""I am looking forward to being the mayor for every single person that calls this city home."" — Jared Ochacher, Kathryn Watson Incumbent Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey holds 10-point lead in first-round ballots With nearly all ballots counted in the first round, no Minneapolis mayoral candidate garnered enough votes to prevent second-choice votes from being a deciding factor in the race. Incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey holds a 10-point lead over his closest challenger, state Sen. Omar Fateh. This summer, Fateh won the Minneapolis DFL's endorsement in an upset, but it was pulled following a complaint by Frey, who alleged that there was an ""extraordinarily high number of missing or uncounted votes."" The state DFL eventually sided with Frey, and the city's DFL was barred from endorsing a candidate for mayor this year. Mary Sheffield wins Detroit mayoral election to become city's first woman mayor, AP projects Detroit City Council President Mary Sheffield was named the winner of the 2025 mayoral election on Tuesday, the Associated Press projects, becoming the first woman elected to the city's top position. ""Tonight, we will celebrate this historic and monumental victory, but tomorrow, we know we go to work,"" Sheffield said during her remarks Tuesday night. Sherrill: ""It's going to take a strong governor here in New Jersey to claw back resources"" New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill said Wednesday that she feels her state is set up for ""great economic success"" despite what she called ""constant economic attacks from the federal government."" ""At every turn, we're seeing real attacks from the federal government, and that's not even to mention the threats of putting National Guard troops on the streets of different towns across America,"" Sherrill said on ""CBS Mornings."" Sherrill added that it was ""going to take a strong governor here in New Jersey to claw back resources."" Sherrill noted some ""big events"" coming up in New Jersey — the FIFA World Cup and the nation's 250th anniversary — that she hopes will help federal economic policy, like President Trump's tariffs. Affordability was a key issue in the New Jersey race, and Sherrill said in her victory speech on Tuesday that she plans to address property tax rates. Trump claims pollsters said shutdown was a ""big factor"" in last night's Democratic victories Speaking to a breakfast for Republican senators, Mr. Trump claims pollsters said the government shutdown was a ""big factor"" in last night's Democratic victories. ""I thought we'd have a discussion after the press leaves about what last night represented and what we should do about it,"" the president said. ""And also about the shutdown and how that relates to last night. I think if you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans, and that was a big factor. And they say that I wasn't on the ballot was the biggest factor. But I don't know about that but I was honored that they said that."" The president said ""countless public servants"" are not being paid and air traffic controllers ""under increasing strain."" ""We must get the government back open soon and really immediately,"" he said, adding that the shutdown is starting to affect the stock market. The president called Tuesday night's election results ""interesting"" and ""we learned a lot."" ""Last night, it was, you know, not expected to be a victory,"" he said. ""It was very Democrat areas. But I don't think it was good for Republicans. I'm not sure it was good for anybody. But we had an interesting evening and we learned a lot."" Democrats lead in Virginia and New Jersey by double digits The Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey could be on track for decisive victories, just one year after both states moved closer to the GOP. In a New Jersey race that was widely expected to be close, Sherrill leads Republican Jack Ciattarelli by 13 points (56.2% to 43.2%) with 95% of the vote counted. And in Virginia, Spanberger leads Republican Winsome Earle-Sears by more than 15 points — 57.5% to 42.3% — with 96% of the vote counted. By comparison, President Trump lost Virginia and New Jersey last year by 5.7 points and 5.9 points, respectively. New Jersey was particularly important for Democrats, since the deep blue state lurched sharply toward Mr. Trump in 2024. Newsom presses other blue states to follow California's lead after redistricting measure passes In a speech celebrating the passage of a California redistricting measure, Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom suggested other Democratic states should also redraw their congressional maps. ""We need to see other states, with their remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well,"" Newsom said. Newsom listed Virginia, Maryland, New York, Illinois and Colorado, several of which have weighed redistricting measures ahead of next year's midterm elections. The governor, who is widely viewed as a possible 2028 presidential contender, argued that other GOP-led states may redraw their maps following efforts by Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, which he referred to as an attempt by President Trump to ""rig"" the midterms. But he also said a victory next year could stymie Mr. Trump. ""We could de facto end Donald Trump's presidency as we know it the minute Speaker Jeffries gets sworn in as speaker of the House of Representatives,"" he said. ""It is all on the line"" Trump: ""AND SO IT BEGINS!"" Shortly after Republicans faced defeats in several states and Californians passed a ballot measure aiming to redraw their congressional map to favor Democrats, President Trump cryptically wrote on Truth Social: ""…AND SO IT BEGINS!"" Mamdani celebrates mayoral win: ""A mandate for change"" Democratic New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani thanked supporters in a speech Tuesday night, framing his campaign as a victory over ""big money and small ideas."" ""Tonight you have delivered a mandate for change, a mandate for a new kind of politics, a mandate for a city we can afford,"" he told the cheering crowd. In a speech that opened with a quote from socialist presidential candidate Eugene Debs, Mamdani touted his proposals to tackle the cost of living and vowed to work with police. And he directly addressed concerns among Democrats that he could be harmful to the party's brand. ""The conventional wisdom would tell you that I am far from the perfect candidate,"" he said, listing his age, Muslim faith and identity as a democratic socialist. ""If tonight teaches us anything, it is that convention has held us back. We have bowed at the altar of caution and we have paid a mighty price."" He took a dig at former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran against him as an independent after falling short in the Democratic primary. ""My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,"" he said. ""I wish Andrew Cuomo only the best in private life. But let tonight be the final time I utter his name, as we turn the page on a politics that abandons the many and answers only to the few."" Turning his attention to President Trump, he argued, ""If there is any way to terrify a despot, is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power."" He continued: ""Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up."" Californians on why they voted ""yes"" on Prop 50 Californians who voted ""Yes"" on Prop 50 overwhelmingly said it was to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states. Nearly all Democrats backed the measure as did a majority of independents, exit polls currently show. Poll percentages may have updated since this post was published. By Jennifer De Pinto and Fred Backus California projected to approve redistricting measure with major political implications California voters approved a ballot measure to allow the state to redraw its voting district maps to make a handful of congressional seats more favorable to Democrats in the 2026 midterms, CBS News projects. Only nine of the state's 52 House districts are currently held by Republicans. The measure, Proposition 50, is a response to Republicans redistricting efforts in Texas and other states at the behest of President Trump, who wants his party to retain control of Congress during the last two years of his second term. The move could play a pivotal role in next year's elections. In recent years, control of the House has been determined by a narrow margin. The measure asked voters whether California should implement a map drawn by the Democratic-controlled state legislature for the next three election cycles, overriding the state's independent redistricting commission. The effort was spearheaded by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is considering a White House run in 2028. Schumer, who did not endorse Mamdani, congratulates him on ""well-earned"" victory Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who did not endorse Democrat Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race and would not say Tuesday how he voted, congratulated the democratic socialist on Tuesday night on his ""well-earned and historic victory."" ""I have worked collaboratively and productively with Mayor-elect Mamdani on a number of vital issues over the years — including delivering historic relief to our taxi drivers who were suffering under crushing and unfair debt — and I look forward to building on that partnership to keep New York City strong, fair, more affordable, and thriving,"" Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. Cuomo says his campaign served as ""caution flag"" Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo touted his campaign for New York City mayor as unifying voters across the political spectrum. In a speech to supporters Tuesday, Cuomo congratulated Zohran Mamdani — who won the mayoral race — and said his team will ""help any way we can because we need our New York City government to work."" Cuomo had the backing of President Trump, New York City Mayor Eric Adams and moderate Democrats, who were critical of Mamdani's policy proposals. Cuomo ran as a third-party candidate after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani, ""This campaign was the right fight to wage,"" Cuomo said while speaking to supporters Tuesday night. ""This campaign was to contest the philosophies that are shaping the Democratic Party, the future of this city and the future of this country."" Cuomo said his campaign served as a ""caution flag that we are heading down a dangerous, dangerous road."" Sherrill criticizes Trump in victory speech Democratic New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill thanked her supporters and took aim at President Trump in a victory speech. Echoing themes from her campaign, she faulted Mr. Trump for uncertainty about food assistance during the government shutdown, and for his vow to ""terminate"" the Gateway Tunnel project, which would replace the aging train tunnels connecting New Jersey to New York City. ""Governors have never mattered more. And in this state, I am determined to build prosperity for all of our citizens,"" she told supporters. Ciattarelli concedes to Sherrill in NJ governor's race Republican Jack Ciattarelli says he called Democrat Mikie Sherrill to congratulate her for winning the New Jersey gubernatorial race. ""It is my hope that Mikie Sherrill has heard us in terms of what we need to do to make New Jersey that place where everybody can once again feel they can achieve their American dream,"" he told supporters. Did Sliwa help Mamdani win? Supporters of New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo urged Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out for months, aiming to thin out a three-person race with Democrat Zohran Mamdani. According to exit polling data, Sliwa's withdrawal from the race may have helped Cuomo — but it might not have been enough for the former governor to overcome Mamdani. About half of Sliwa voters say they would have voted for Cuomo if Sliwa weren't on the ballot in a hypothetical race between just the two of them. Among voters overall, a hypothetical 2-way matchup between Mamdani and Cuomo would have been close, but Mamdani may have still had the edge. By Jennifer De Pinto and Fred Backus Mamdani leads with coalition of liberal voters, young people, renters and college grads Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani did well with voters under 45, and particularly so with voters under 30, according to exit poll data. One of his biggest campaign promises was to freeze the rent for millions of tenants who live in rent-stabilized apartments. Renters are supporting him in big numbers, a group that made up more than half of those voting. Mamdani also leads with college graduates, who outnumbered people without college degrees in Tuesday's electorate. Mamdani leads handily with voters who said the cost of living is their most important issue. Meanwhile, Democrat-turned-independent Andrew Cuomo emphasized the issue of crime, as did Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. Cuomo leads with voters who picked crime as their top issue. By Jennifer De Pinto and Fred Backus Earle-Sears says she hopes Spanberger governs as a moderate Republican Winsome Earle-Sears offered well-wishes to her opponent, Democrat Abigail Spanberger, who is projected to win Virginia's gubernatorial race, and said ""I hope and pray"" that Spanberger governs the state as a moderate. ""I asked her to support policies that will unite us, that will not divide us, that will strengthen our families and keep us safe. And that if I can ever be of help doing that, I'm here. I'm ready to volunteer,"" Earle-Sears told supporters. ""After all, apparently, I have nothing else to do."" Spanberger also thanked her supporters. ""I think I learn more in a loss than I ever do in a victory,"" she told supporters. ""It's either going to tear you apart or it's going to build you. Well, I don't tear apart."" DNC chair says Mamdani win ""illustrated the power of a big-tent party"" Ken Martin, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, praised Zohran Mamdani for running ""an impressive campaign, laser-focused on what matters most to working families in New York."" ""His campaign galvanized and energized voters across New York City and met those voters where they live,"" Martin said. ""Mayor-elect Mamdani's campaign illustrated the power of a big-tent party that focuses relentlessly on lifting up all working people."" Some in the Democratic Party were critical of Mamdani ahead of his election. Establishment Democratic leaders offered lukewarm endorsements of the democratic socialist, or none at all, and moderate Democrats tried to distance themselves from his proposals. GOP seizes on Mamdani win for midterms Zohran Mamdani is Republicans' new campaign boogeyman. The GOP was quick to attack Democrats after the democratic socialist won the New York City's mayoral race. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the victory will have consequences that ""will be felt across our entire nation."" ""Zohran Mamdani's election cements the Democrat Party's transformation to a radical, big-government socialist party,"" the Louisiana Republican said in a statement. ""Now, every House Democrat incumbent and candidate will co-own Mamdani's disastrous record in the 2026 midterms."" In a separate statement, the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP's campaign arm, said: ""Every House Democrat is foolishly complicit in their party's collapse, and voters will make them pay in 2026."" The Republican National Committee said ""Democrats will be held accountable by voters for embracing Mamdani's far-left agenda and the consequences it will bring"" in next year's elections. Trump reacts to Republicans' election losses In his first public reaction to Tuesday night's election results, President Trump cited ""pollsters"" who blamed Republican losses on the fact that the president wasn't on the ballot and the government shutdown, which has lasted for more than a month. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: ""'TRUMP WASN'T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,'"" according to Pollsters. Mr. Trump's comments came shortly after pollster Matt Towery made similar comments on Fox News' ""Hannity."" ""Shutdown, shutdown, shutdown. That had a big effect on this election,"" Towery said, referring to the Virginia governor's race, adding, ""the GOP has to figure out how to turn out races without Donald Trump on the ballot."" What Mamdani's win could mean for Democrats nationwide Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory on Tuesday in the New York City mayoral race is already fanning the debate about the future of the Democratic Party and what his sudden political stardom could mean for next year's midterm elections. ""We hope this is demonstrating a very powerful way forward,"" said Ashik Siddique, a national co-chair of the Democratic Socialists of America. ""This election proves that democratic socialist ideas are very popular."" His victory is the biggest win for progressives since Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated 10-term incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in 2018. But history suggests his success isn't likely to translate to a progressive sweep nationwide. ""It's very reminiscent of 2018 when you had this superstar, young, telegenic and extremely capable candidate win a primary in New York City and set the world on fire,"" said Matt Bennett, the executive vice president for public affairs for moderate Democratic group Third Way. ""But in the end, the thing that really mattered was that 40 seats were flipped, and Nancy Pelosi got the gavel — and those seats were flipped by moderates."" In the 2024 primary elections, ""mainstream"" Democrats outperformed progressive candidates, winning about two-thirds of the races, according to a study from the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The study also noted just three House candidates and one Senate candidate who identify as democratic socialists won their elections in 2024. Read more here. Democrat Jay Jones wins Virginia AG race despite texting scandal, CBS News projects CBS News projected that Jay Jones, a Democrat and former Virginia state delegate, defeated Republican incumbent Jason Miyares in Virginia's attorney general race after resisting calls to drop out over violent text messages. In the final weeks of the race, years-old text messages from Jones were leaked in which the Democrat mused about shooting a political rival. Jones faced condemnation from members in both parties and apologized for his comments, which surfaced after a spate of political violence, including the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Mamdani wins NYC mayor's race, CBS News projects Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won New York City's mayoral race in a major feat for progressives, CBS News projected. Mamdani, a 34-year-old New York state assembly member, will become the city's first Muslim mayor. He beat Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York, who ran as an independent after his defeat by Mamdani in the Democratic primary, as well as Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. Schumer declares victory for Democrats As results came in Tuesday night, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was quick to declare victory for Democrats. ""Tonight's results are a repudiation of the Trump agenda. The cruelty, chaos and greed that define MAGA radicalism and are skyrocketing costs were firmly rejected by the American people,"" the New York Democrat said in a statement. ""If Republicans want to keep blindly following Donald Trump into the abyss of chaos, let them. The rest of America is moving forward,"" he added. Democrats in New Jersey hang on the governor's mansion with Mikie Sherrill projected to win Democrat Mikie Sherrill, who flipped a Republican congressional seat in 2018, won the governor's race in New Jersey, CBS News projected. Sherrill's victory keeps the governorship in Democratic control after President Trump made advances in the blue state during the 2024 election. Sherrill was locked in a close race with Republican Jack Ciattarelli in the final weeks. CBS News rates New Jersey's governor's race as likely Democratic CBS News rates New Jersey's governor's race as likely Democratic. Democrat Mikie Sherrill is hoping to keep the governorship in Democratic hands after President Trump made gains in the state in the last election. Virginia attorney general race leans Democratic CBS News rates Virginia's attorney general race as lean Democratic, signaling that Jay Jones could overcome a scandal that plagued his campaign in the final weeks after violent years-old text messages surfaced. Jones is running against incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares. Spanberger says Virginia chose ""pragmatism over partisanship"" Speaking after her win, Democrat Abigail Spanberger vowed to serve all Virginia voters, including those who did not vote for her, and said Tuesday's result ""sent a message."" ""We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship,"" she said in a speech to supporters. ""We chose our commonwealth over chaos. You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most — lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian."" Map of live New York City mayoral election results New York City mayoral race leans Mamdani As polls close in New York City, CBS News has rated the mayoral race as leaning toward Democrat Zohran Mamdani, based on exit polling data and internal analytics. Mamdani is running against Democrat-turned-third-party candidate Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa. Trump 2024 campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita on Virginia: ""A Bad candidate and Bad campaign have consequences"" Veteran GOP strategist Chris LaCivita, a co-manager of President Trump's 2024 campaign, reacted to Spanberger's victory with harsh words for her Republican opponent, Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. ""A Bad candidate and Bad campaign have consequences — the Virginia Governors race is example number 1,"" LaCivita wrote on X. Sherrill performing well with Latino voters In 2024, President Trump made gains with Latino voters nationally, narrowing the gap with Democrat Kamala Harris to just single digits (she won the group by just five points). In New Jersey, Mr. Trump also made inroads in Latino communities such as Passaic County. On Tuesday, Democrat Mikie Sherrill is performing well with Latino voters, exit polls currently show. She leads with them by a wide margin. The economy was the top issue for Latino voters in New Jersey, and most said the Trump administration's immigration enforcement actions have gone too far. By Jennifer De Pinto and Fred Backus Spanberger propelled to victory by Virginians worried about economy Democrat Abigail Spanberger's win in the Virginia governor's race was fueled in part by voters who picked the economy as their most important issue and those who say they were impacted a ""a lot"" by federal government cuts, according to exit polling data. She won with support from more traditional Democratic groups like women and Black voters, and made some inroads with groups that backed Republican Glenn Youngkin in 2021 in his run for governor. Independents went for Youngkin in 2021, but swung to Spanberger this year. In 2021, Youngkin ran on a platform on parental rights and won the backing of parents. But four years later, parents backed Spanberger. Most Virginia voters disapprove of the job President Trump is doing as president, and roughly two-thirds of Spanberger's voters say a reason for supporting her was to oppose Mr. Trump. By Jennifer De Pinto and Fred Backus Democrat wins Virginia lieutenant governor's race, CBS News projects Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won the Virginia lieutenant governor's race against Republican John Reid, CBS News projects. In Virginia, the governor and lieutenant governor do not run on a joint ticket. CBS News projected earlier Tuesday that former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger won the governor's race against GOP Lt. Gov Winsome Earle-Sears. Virginia lieutenant governor's race is likely Democratic CBS News rated Virginia's lieutenant governor's race as likely Democratic, giving Ghazala Hashmi the edge over Republican John Reid. Map of live New Jersey governor election results New Jersey governor's race rated as lean Democratic CBS News rates the New Jersey governor's race as lean Democratic, as polls close in the state. Democrat Mikie Sherrill is facing off against Republican Jack Ciattarelli for the position, which is currently held by Democrats. Spanberger defeats Earle-Sears to become Virginia's first female governor Former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger defeated Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears to be Virginia's next governor, CBS News projected. Spanberger makes history as the first woman to serve in the role. Spanberger, who ran as moderate, flipped the seat, which is currently held by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Youngkin is prohibited from running for a consecutive term under state law. The race is widely seen as a referendum on President Trump, who did not endorse Earle-Sears. On Monday, Mr. Trump did not mention her by name when he held a telephone rally with the state GOP. Virginia governor's race rated as likely Democratic CBS News now rates the Virginia governor's race as likely Democratic — meaning former Rep. Abigail Spanberger is likely to defeat Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Spanberger performing better with key groups than former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe did in 2021 in loss to Youngkin Democrat Abigail Spanberger is performing better with some key groups than Democrat Terry McAuliffe did in 2021, when he lost to Republican Glenn Youngkin. Spanberger leads with women by double digits, voter groups that McAuliffe won by just seven points in 2021. The economy was top of mind for women voters, and those who picked it as their top issue are backing Spanberger. She is also doing better with Black voters and voters under 30. Republican Winsome Earle-Sears is getting strong backing from White evangelical voters and conservatives. Poll percentages may have updated since this post was published. By Jennifer De Pinto and Fred Backus Virginia governor's race leans Democratic, AG race is a toss-up As polls close in Virginia, CBS News rates the state's gubernatorial race as lean Democratic, while the race for attorney general remains a toss-up. The contest for lieutenant governor also leans Democratic. In the race for governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger is competing against Republican Winsome Earle-Sears. Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares is running for reelection against Democratic nominee Jay Jones. Democrat Ghazala Hashmi and Republican John Reid are facing off for lieutenant governor. Top Kentucky elections official fields calls from voters wanting to know why polls are closed Tuesday's state and local elections in Virginia, New Jersey, New York and a handful of other locales have drawn national attention — leading some excited Kentuckians to try to head to the polls, says Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams. ""We're getting calls about polls being closed. They are closed because we do not have elections today. Kentucky votes next year,"" Adams wrote in a post on X. ""You cannot vote today in Kentucky for the mayor of New York City or the Governor of Virginia. Sorry."" How are Trump's actions on immigration playing in New Jersey, NYC, California? While the economy outranks immigration as a top issue, voters did weigh in on President Trump's actions on immigration. In New Jersey, more than half of voters think the Trump administration's actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far. And we do see some differences in how voters in New Jersey want their next governor to deal with the Trump administration on immigration enforcement and how New York City's voters want their next mayor to approach that. While divided, more voters in New Jersey want their next governor to cooperate with the Trump administration on immigration enforcement than voters in New York City do. In New York City, most voters would rather see their next mayor not cooperate with the Trump administration on this. Views in California — which has been home to a number of ICE operations — are similar to New York City. As voters cast ballots on Proposition 50, most want their governor not to cooperate with the Trump administration on immigration enforcement. *Poll percentages may have updated since this post was published. By Jennifer De Pinto and Fred Backus New Yorkers out in droves to vote in mayoral race New York City voters were out in droves today, casting ballots aligned with the issues that matter most to them. By 3 p.m., more than 1.4 million New Yorkers had voted, including the tally from early voting. Many New Yorkers said their votes were guided by campaign promises of the candidates, Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa. ""I think it's a really important election. We kind of just need a new wave of change,"" Manhattan resident K.C. Pruitt said. Throughout the five boroughs, voters said the No. 1 issue on their minds is affordability. For the latest in the New York City mayor's race, follow along here. By CBS New York California voters think both parties have been unfair in redistricting As Californians vote on whether to approve a congressional redistricting plan, about half of the state's voters don't think either political party — Democratic or Republican — has been fair in their handling of redrawing district lines, according to exit polling data. More generally, regardless of how they are voting, a majority of California voters say each state's congressional district lines should be drawn by a nonpartisan commission rather than the party in power. California currently has an independent redistricting commission, but the measure on Tuesday's ballot would temporarily sideline the panel and change the state's House districts in response to Texas' redistricting efforts. The president is a factor here for more than half of voters — more to show opposition to him than support. By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus Exit polls on NYC voters and mayoral candidates' positions on Israel Events overseas have played a role in this local campaign race. Most New York City voters overall say the candidates' positions on Israel were a factor in their vote, although it is a major factor for fewer than half. It is more of a factor for Jewish voters. By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus Early exit poll findings in Virginia and New Jersey In Virginia, most voters say federal government cuts this year have affected their family's finances, including about one in five who report being affected a lot. This includes many who have been employed by the federal government this year. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger has focused her campaign on affordability and has been critical of the Trump administration's cuts to the federal government. Republican Winsome Earle-Sears has emphasized issues and policies concerning transgender people, and about half of Virginia's voters think support for transgender rights in society have gone too far, particularly Republicans. In New Jersey, each of the candidates for governor emphasized affordability in their campaigns, and taxes and the economy are the top issues for voters. Taxes are more of a priority for Republican Jack Ciattarelli's voters, while the economy is the most important issue for Democrat Mikie Sherril's supporters. Most also say property taxes and electricity costs are big problems in the area where they live, exit polls currently show. By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus New York City voters say cost of housing is major problem, according to exit polls Three in four New York City voters say the cost of housing is a major problem. Most call crime a problem, but fewer than half call it a ""major"" one. A lot of the campaign has been defined by whether voters want a mayor with experience or a change agent. Both of those traits top a list of what the city's voters are looking for in a candidate. Democrat Zohran Mandami's voters are more likely to be looking for someone who will bring needed change, while those backing lifelong Democrat-turned-third-party candidate Andrew Cuomo are looking for someone with experience. By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus Trump a factor for many voters in Virginia, New Jersey, NYC, California, based on early exit polls Early exit polls show economic concerns are what's on the minds of voters as they cast ballots in key elections in Virginia, New Jersey, New York City and California. Worries about the economy are coupled with broader discontent with the state of the country right now. In Virginia and New Jersey, roughly two-thirds of voters are dissatisfied or angry about the way things are going. It's even higher in California. And President Trump looms over the contests in these historically Democratic-leaning places, with many saying he is a factor in their vote, and more so to express opposition to him than support, according to early exit polls. This is not uncommon in off-year elections, which are often partly a referendum on the sitting president. (In the 2021 Virginia race for governor, about half of voters said their vote was at least, in part, about then-President Joe Biden) President Trump's overall job rating is underwater — with more who disapprove than approve of his job performance — in each of the places where exit polls are being conducted: Virginia, New Jersey, New York City, and California. In these contests for elected office, most voters made up their minds about their candidate a long time ago, but roughly a quarter in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City, made their decision in the last month. By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus Virginia's Republican AG encourages voters to ticket-split Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Republican running for reelection, suggested in the final hours of voting that voters consider backing him in the AG race and a Democrat in the gubernatorial race. Miyares posted a video Tuesday morning in which he spoke with a voter named Dave who supports Democrat Abigail Spanberger for governor but voted for Miyares for attorney general. In the caption, Miyares wrote, ""Dave's splitting his ticket — you can too."" In other cases, Miyares has encouraged people to vote for the entire GOP ticket — including Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears. But Miyares has been courting split-ticket voters following the recent controversies surrounding his Democratic rival for attorney general, Jay Jones, who sent violent and inflammatory texts in 2022. Miyares was running several points ahead of Earle-Sears in pre-election polls. What Trump has said about the candidates in tonight's races President Trump has endorsed candidates in most — but not all — of Tuesday's biggest races. - The president has enthusiastically endorsed New Jersey's GOP candidate for governor, Jack Ciattarelli. He held a telephone rally for Ciattarelli on the eve of the election: ""This is the biggest election — the entire country is watching New Jersey,"" he said. - Mr. Trump also gave Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is running for reelection, his ""complete and total endorsement,"" boosting Miyares and Republican lieutenant governor candidate John Reid in a tele-rally Monday. - Notably, the president hasn't endorsed Virginia GOP gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears by name, though he has encouraged Virginians to vote for the entire Republican ticket and attacked Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger. - The president has repeatedly encouraged people to vote for New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who is running third-party against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani — likely an unwelcome endorsement for Cuomo, who has long sparred with Mr. Trump. ""I'm not a fan of Cuomo one way or the other, but if it's gonna be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I'm gonna pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,"" the president told ""60 Minutes."" (Mamdani describes himself as a democratic socialist, not a communist.) - Mr. Trump called California's redistricting plan a ""GIANT SCAM."" He has supported redistricting efforts in several Republican-leaning states. Schumer declines to say who he voted for in NYC mayoral race Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, declined to say who he voted for in the New York City mayoral race. ""I voted, and I look forward to working with the next mayor to help New York City,"" he said. Schumer has not endorsed the Democratic nominee, Zohran Mamdani. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, defeated Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York, in the primary. Cuomo then ran as an independent, and won the support of some Democrats who have been critical of Mamdani — and even President Trump. The president said Monday in a Truth Social post, ""Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him and hope he does a fantastic job,"" the president said in a Truth Social post. Mr. Trump also said if Zohran Mamdani wins Tuesday, ""it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success or even survival!"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, endorsed Mamdani just a day before early voting began in late October, but has not appeared enthusiastic about his campaign. California's Prop 50 on redrawing congressional districts Proposition 50 would allow California Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to Democrats. It's an initiative intended to respond to President Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps and give the GOP a better shot at holding on to its narrow House majority in next year's midterm elections. California has 52 congressional districts, 43 represented by Democrats and nine by Republicans. The five GOP-led districts targeted under Proposition 50 are District 1, represented by Rep. Doug LaMalfa; District 3, represented by Rep. Kevin Kiley; District 22, represented by Rep. David Valadao; District 41, represented by Rep. Ken Calvert; and District 48, represented by Rep. Darrell Issa. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who pushed Prop 50 through California's Assembly, rallied supporters of the measure in San Francisco on Monday night. ""We're going to get out there and win and send a powerful message not only to the people of the state of California, but the people all over the United States of America,"" Newsom said. A recent CBS News poll found that among voters who plan to support Proposition 50, one reason they're doing so is to oppose the Trump administration — which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states — and oppose national Republicans. Virginia governor's race: Earle-Sears v. Spanberger Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is running against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in the race, and in either case, the winner will make history in the commonwealth as its first female governor. If Earle-Sears wins, she'll become the first female Black governor. There's no incumbent in this race — there never is, since Virginia governors may not run for consecutive terms under state law. Virginia's gubernatorial election is often seen as a potential referendum on the incumbent president. The president's party often loses the Virginia governor's race, which always falls in the year following a presidential election. Spanberger has made it clear she's running against Mr. Trump's policies during the campaign, saying, ""It is because of the trade wars and the retaliatory tariff policies and the attack on Virginia, our economy and our people, that we recognize the possibility of November 4."" The Trump administration's broadsides against the federal workforce hit Virginia hard, since the state has hundreds of thousands of civilian federal employees and contractors. Besides the reduction-in-force cuts by the administration, federal workers are taking an economic hit in the government shutdown that's now stretching into its second month. Earle-Sears has focused on immigration and transgender issues, and in their October debate, she pressed Spanberger on whether she'd keep transgender youth out of girls' high school sports and bathrooms. During the campaign, Earle-Sears has campaigned alongside Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, but she was not endorsed by President Trump. Mr. Trump appeared in a telerally on Monday night for the Republican ticket, attacking Spanberger and encouraging people to vote for Republicans, but he didn't mention Earle-Sears by name. New Jersey governor's race: Sherrill v. Ciattarelli New Jersey voters are deciding between former GOP New Jersey state Rep. Jack Ciattarelli and Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill in the race for governor today. Sherrill, who flipped a Republican congressional seat in 2018, is running as a moderate and trying to tie Ciattarelli to President Trump. Ciattarelli counters that Sherrill is blaming Mr. Trump for everything. Both candidates are appealing to voters' concerns about the high cost of living: Ciattarelli is touting a ""Make New Jersey Affordable Again"" pitch, while Sherrill features an ""Affordability Agenda"" on her campaign website. In September, CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records to an ally of Ciattarelli in error. Republicans allied with Ciattarelli have been examining Sherrill's record in the Navy, looking for information about a Naval Academy cheating scandal that implicated over 100 midshipmen. Sherrill was not accused of wrongdoing but did not walk in her graduation, which she said was because she ""didn't turn in some of my classmates."" Sherrill had an unblemished career in the Navy and, as a midshipman, received a Navy Achievement Medal in 1991 for saving the life of a classmate. New York City mayoral race sees high turnout The mayoral race between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa had record-breaking early voting turnout before polls opened at 6 a.m. Tuesday across the five boroughs. By noon, the City Board of Elections had reported 1,195,062 voter check-ins — including 735,317 during early voting. Brooklyn has the highest voter turnout so far, followed by Manhattan, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island. Polls stay open until 9 p.m. ET. In addition to the mayor's race, New Yorkers are also voting for several other local offices and six ballot proposals. Some polling sites in New Jersey received hoax bomb threats Several polling sites in New Jersey received threats this morning, but two senior homeland security officials and a federal law enforcement source said there are currently no credible threats to polling sites nationwide, including in New Jersey. Those threats were determined to be a hoax. New Jersey Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way said in a statement that the bomb threats resulted in the closure of several polling sites. After law enforcement determined the threats were not credible, some were reopened. State Attorney General Matthew Platkin said other polling sites remained closed and voters were being directed to cast their ballots at nearby locations instead. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency promised Tuesday to ""steadfastly operate within its statutory mission to protect the nation's critical infrastructure from cyber and physical threats,"" even amid the shutdown, which CISA director of public affairs Marci McCarthy blamed on Democrats. When do polls close? Voters headed to the polls today in several states, with races that are being closely watched in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia. New York City is choosing a new mayor, while New Jersey and Virginia voters are electing a governor. In California, redistricting is on the ballot as Proposition 50. Each of these races could be viewed early bellwethers for next year's midterm elections. Here are the poll closing times for those races: 7 p.m. ET: Polls close in Virginia 8 p.m. ET: Polls close in New Jersey 9 p.m. ET: Polls close in New York 11 p.m. ET (8 p.m. PT): Polls close in California If you're in line when polls close, you'll be allowed to vote.",left

"Black Friday and Cyber Monday (which is happening today) aren’t sprints anymore; they’ve fused together into a shopping marathon. Instead of one day for in-store deals and another for online promos, retailers now host weeks-long events, prompting experts to coin the term Black November (which feels much more accurate, if you ask me). Now that deals are live, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the hundreds of sales out there, and the last thing you want to do is impulse buy or overspend, especially if tariffs shrank your budget this year. To help you make a Black Friday and Cyber Monday game plan, I put together this guide filled with tips and tricks I swear by after covering the sales for over five years. I also talked to experts to get their advice about what to buy, what to skip and how to save the most. Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter. Head’s up: Black Friday and Cyber Monday will be different this year Deals won’t be as fantastic as usual, but they’re still worthwhile. Believe me, this is not the news I wanted to hear either. But tariffs are impacting Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and it’s important to understand how so you can manage your expectations and strategize appropriately. Here’s the deal: To avoid drastically increasing prices for customers, most retailers are currently partially absorbing tariff costs, which limits how much they can afford to discount products and still make a profit. “Retailers will still give us Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, but less of them, and discounts won’t be as deep,” says Erik Guzik, an assistant clinical professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Montana College of Business. “In the past, we may have expected a 40% to 50% discount, but this year, 20% to 30% may be what we need to consider quite good, especially in areas that have been targeted by tariffs, like clothing, footwear, toys and electronics.” That doesn’t mean deals aren’t worth shopping. They absolutely are, especially since experts expect consumer goods prices to increase in 2026. “Any discount at this point is positive,” says Guzik. Most retailers overstocked their warehouses before the new tariff policy took effect to avoid increased duties, but once that inventory is gone, they’ll have to import items and pay higher tariff rates, giving them no choice but to increase products’ prices in most cases, says Guzik. Add to cart and checkout ASAP. All the experts I talked to have one main piece of advice for shoppers: hurry. Because retailers are discounting products during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, while partially absorbing the cost of tariffs, their profit margins are quite low. That will probably cause them to limit product quantities, like only putting 500 models of a certain TV on sale rather than 1,000, which means you’ll see items go out-of-stock quicker than usual, says Ronald Goodstein, an associate professor of marketing at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. The overall takeaway? “Once you see that discount, it’s probably the best one we’re getting this holiday season,” says Guzik. “Waiting to see if deals get better, which likely won’t be the case, is more risky than ever. Once an item goes out of stock, it probably won’t come back.” What to shop during Black Friday and Cyber Monday Tariffs are making them less flashy than usual, but Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales still offer the deepest discounts across the biggest selection of products all year. That means (almost) everything on your wishlist will likely be on sale. The best deals, however, tend to fall within four categories: tech, toys, small home and kitchen appliances, and subscriptions and experiences. “These are the categories where retailers go big and prices are strong,” says Stephanie Carls, a retail insights expert at RetailMeNot. Below, I break down what to look for in each category and examples of popular products on sale now. Tech There’s no better time of year to buy tech than Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Most brands drop prices on TVs, laptops, video game consoles, headphones, speakers, smart home products, smartwatches and more by about 30 to 50%, says Ashley Feinstein Gerstley, a shopping and savings strategist at Rakuten, and you’ll find lots of tech listed at its lowest price ever. If you’re specifically in the market for video game consoles, there’s no shortage of deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday from top brands like Nintendo and PlayStation. And beyond discounts on individual consoles, controllers and games, brands usually sell exclusive bundles as some of their best offers of the year. Our team is always waiting for the Nintendo Switch bundle to drop around Black Friday, for example. Last year, it came with the original Nintendo Switch, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and a 12-month subscription to Nintendo Switch Online for $299.98 — that’s $79.99 less than if you bought each item separately. This year, we’re eyeing Nintendo Switch 2 bundles like the Nintendo Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bundle. Toys Toys are among the most competitive categories during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, both in terms of discounts and demand. The most popular toys sell out quickly (I’m talking a couple of hours, maximum), so once you see prices drop, buy your must-haves immediately. Legos, Barbies, Hot Wheels, Hasbro board games, Tamagotchis — they’ll be on sale and they’ll go fast. Small home and kitchen appliances Almost every small home and kitchen appliance you can think of gets discounted this month, so now is the time to buy that Vitamix blender or Dyson vacuum you’re dreaming about. In addition to items you use year-round, keep an eye on seasonal appliances, like space heaters and snow blowers, as well as tableware, home decor and other essentials you’ll need to host guests during the holidays, says Gerstley. Subscriptions and experiences Tangible products aren’t the only things discounted on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Almost every company that sells something hops on the bandwagon, and in recent years, we’ve seen discounts on subscriptions to TV, music and educational platforms. In 2024, for example, you could get a year-long Hulu subscription for $0.99 per month (normally $9.99 a month) and an annual MasterClass subscription for 50% off. There are deals on experiences, too, like travel packages, fitness classes and spa treatments, especially at local businesses in your area. What not to shop during Black Friday and Cyber Monday If you’re trying to narrow down your shopping list, Carls recommends waiting to buy everyday apparel (especially cold-weather pieces), beauty products and furniture. “Those tend to drop more in December when stores start clearing inventory,” she says. You can skip mattresses, too, as well as large home and kitchen appliances — discounts tend to be just as good around President’s Day. Expert shopping tips: Black Friday and Cyber Monday do’s and don’ts As I mentioned above, Black Friday and Cyber Monday aren’t sprints anymore; they’re a shopping marathon. Those who plan for it will save the most, so to help you strategize, I rounded up a list of dos and don’ts based on my 5+ years of experience covering sales, as well as experts’ advice. Don’t: Wait for prices to drop more “If it’s a good price and the exact model you want, grab it,” says Carls. Limited inventories and products going out of stock are certainties, not predictions, so it’s better to buy now than panic later. Do: Make a shopping list Making a mental shopping list isn’t nearly as useful as writing it down, whether on paper or your phone’s notes app. Some retailers also let you create wishlists on their websites. Referring to your shopping list helps you hold yourself accountable for buying what you actually need rather than filling your cart with impulse purchases. Once you’ve nailed down your list, rank order it, says Henry Jin, a professor of supply chain management at Miami University’s Farmer School of Business. “You’re only saving money if you’re paying less for things you’ve always wanted or really need,” he says. “Rank order your wish list based on the greatest need, and recognize that the items on the bottom of that list may be aspirational purchases you can delay for now.” Do: Set a budget Think about the grand total you’re comfortable spending this season, factoring in costs like gifts (for yourself and others), travel, hosting expenses, gift wrapping supplies and shipping fees, says Gerstley. Put a chunk of that aside for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and build in what Gerstley calls a “fun buffer” to give you room for a spontaneous splurge or two without feeling stressed. Also, before shopping for holiday gifts, talk to your loved ones about budgets beforehand so everyone is on the same page. Do: Get cozy with your favorite retailers Sign up for your favorite brands’ email newsletters, SMS lists and push app alerts, and follow them on social media. Companies often use these channels to update shoppers about flash sales, limited-edition drops, new deals and extra promos you might be able to stack on top of the discount. Do: Stack savings Retailers likely aren’t slashing prices as much as they have in years past, but stacking savings can take a deal from good to great. On top of getting the discount, paying with a credit card that lets you earn points as you spend, downloading cashback extensions, adding extra promo codes and coupons and shopping on websites with free shipping are all ways to put money back in your pocket, says Carls. Don’t: Ignore shipping fees and where products ship from No one wants to pay for shipping, but if you’re shopping online, you’re at the mercy of the retailer, says Jin. Shipping fees can drive up the price of your purchase, so try to avoid them if you can. One of the best ways to do so is buying online and picking up in-store, and doing the bulk of your shopping at retailers whose loyalty programs you’re part of, like Amazon Prime, Walmart+ and Target Circle, all of which offer free shipping as a perk. During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, some retailers also offer free shipping if you spend a certain amount, so look out for those offers. But be aware that the minimum order required to unlock free shipping might be higher than you’re used to due to tariffs. “A way for retailers to absorb some of the higher expenses is to require customers to spend more in order to qualify for free shipping,” says Jin. Also, pay attention to where products ship from before you check out. Sometimes retailers don’t disclose that information, but if they do, and your products are shipping from outside the U.S., you may have to pay additional tariffs since the de minimis exception ended this summer. Experts also recommend only shopping from retailers you’re familiar with — buying from those you’re unfamiliar with means there’s a greater chance for surprises to pop up. And since you don’t have experience with them, you won’t be able to recognize red flags, like exorbitant shipping fees. Do: Comparison shop During major sale events, retailers usually sell the same products for the exact (or almost exact) same prices, a practice called price chasing. In these cases, deciding where to buy comes down to the details. Compare shipping fees, stackable promo codes and coupons, cashback offers, return policies, extended warranties and reward points you might be eligible for. You can also set up price drop alerts through certain retailers’ websites, like Amazon, or through tools like Keepa, CamelCamelCamel and Honey, so you’ll immediately know if any brands discount an item more than you expected them to. Comparison shopping helps you “cherry pick” deals so you get the absolute lowest price on each item, rather than blindly doing all your shopping at one place and potentially sacrificing savings, says Goodstein. Do: Track prices Retailers sometimes raise prices prior to major sales like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and at NBC Select, we follow specific criteria to evaluate deals before recommending them. We use price trackers like CamelCamelCamel, Honey and Keepa to evaluate an item’s price history and determine if it’s actually a good deal or just temporarily marked down from an inflated baseline. You can use these sites to track prices, too. Don’t: Forget to read return and price matching polices Most retailers let you return Black Friday and Cyber Monday purchases within a certain timeframe, and some even offer an extended return policy around the holidays. Make sure you actually read retailers’ return policies so you know when you’ll have to send something back by, if needed — no one wants to get stuck with a product they don’t want. Also, research what retailers have return policies, especially since shopping early is so important this year. If an item drops in price within the two weeks after you buy it, for example, some retailers will honor the lower price and refund you the difference, says Goodstein.

"The European Central Bank’s (ECB) vice-president has said the European Union’s (EU) current agenda to simplify business rules and boost capital flow across the union, aimed at enhancing competitiveness, cannot succeed without the development of a true single market for goods and services. Speaking at a Federation of International Banks in Ireland (Fibi) conference in Dublin on Wednesday, with a focus on how banking regulators are feeding into the EU simplification drive, Luis de Guindos said it is “impossible” to have a savings and investment union “without a real integration of goods and services markets”. The EU single market has been in existence for goods and services since 1993. However, a landmark report on EU competitiveness last year, written by former ECB president Mario Draghi, found that Europe’s existing internal barriers act as a de facto 44 per cent tariff on average goods and a 100 per cent tariff for services. The European Commission is now pressing various institutions, including the ECB, to come up with ways of reducing complexity in rules and regulations. It is hoped this will boost economic competitiveness and growth. READ MORE Mr de Guindos is chair of an ECB taskforce that will make proposals by the end of the year on how banking supervision can be simplified. If they are endorsed by the ECB governing council, they will be sent to the commission for consideration. While the UK government and the Trump administration in the US are currently seeking to water down some regulations introduced following the 2008 financial crisis, regulators across the eurozone have no appetite to ease bank capital or liquidity requirements. Irish business grandee Gary McGann on working with Michael Smurfit, the fall of Anglo Irish and the current state of the Irish economy “Simplification doesn’t mean deregulation,” Mr de Guindos said. “That is something we have to make very, very clear.” Central Bank of Ireland deputy governor, Mary-Elizabeth McMunn, said the objective is to “remove unnecessary burden and unnecessary complexity so that we can have better processes and free up our collective resources”. Ms McMunn rejected calls from some financial lobby groups for a pause in new financial rules as the simplification project is under way. She said regulators and legislators need to keep up with innovation in the financial industry. She referred to a speech from US Federal Reserve board member Michael Barr in July. Mr Barr highlighted how a number of financial boom-to-bust cycles – including the Great Depression almost a century ago, the US savings and loans crisis in 1990s and financial crash in 2008 – were preceded by the regulatory environment failing to keep up with financial innovation. “I’d be worried about the gaps that’d emerge [if there was a pause],” she said. Asked if there is a balance to be struck in the simplification exercise between maintaining the hard-won resilience of the European banking sector and competitiveness, Mr de Guindos said: “If you do not have a resilient banking sector, it’s going to be extremely difficult to have a competitive one.”",left

Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire Click here to browse full transcripts from 2025 of ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan."" MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: The shutdown is over, but the problems that led to the crisis persist, and politicians are scrambling to make prices affordable for Americans. Affordability is the new buzzword in Washington, and President Trump is testing ideas to help consumers, including potential tariff dividends and 50-year mortgages. Those may be a tough sell, but Mr. Trump did move to help consumers by rolling back tariffs on some food imports, like bananas, beef and tomatoes. (Begin VT) DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): There's been a little bit of a rollback with some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they will be on the low side in a very short period of time. In terms of affordability, it's not a good word for the Democrats. It's a good word for us, because our prices are much lower and will soon be much, much lower. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: One price spike that can't be fixed by easing tariffs, health care premiums, especially for those covered under Obamacare. We will look for solutions for that fix and more with two members of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, New York Democrat Tom Suozzi and Nebraska Republican Don Bacon, along with Dr. and Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy and New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen. And as we move into a new era of warfare, what does our military need for readiness? We will talk with the secretary of the army, Dan Driscoll. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Although we're all trying to put the pain of the shutdown behind us, the 43-day standoff on Capitol Hill exposed and amplified the need to address the rising cost of health care premiums. And our CBS News polling out today shows that two-thirds of Americans think their premiums will increase in the coming months. We begin today with two members of the so-called House Problem Solvers Caucus, New York Democrat Tom Suozzi and Nebraska Republican Don Bacon. Good morning. Good to have you here in a bipartisan conversation. You both recognize there's a problem here. Congressman Bacon, let me start with you. One out of every five dollars in this country that is spent goes to health care. We know these COVID era tax credit subsidies for Obamacare will go away at the end of the month. That's going to hit about 22 of the 24 million Americans who use that program. What can you do in the next six weeks to make costs go down in January? REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON (R-Nebraska): Well, we need a temporary extension of these tax credits to keep these prices down. Republicans nor Democrats want to see premiums skyrocket. And they will if these expire with nothing in its place. That's why I worked with Tom Suozzi and other Democrats and Republicans to find a compromise. We just don't want to do a clean extension. Most Republicans don't anyway. So we think there needs to be some caps on income, and we want to assure all these credits go directly to lowering people's premiums. And, right now, about a third of the money doesn't make it to the premiums. So those are some reforms that we would like to see. And if we can get those accomplished, then we can extend these tax credits and keep these – the prices lower. But we do need a longer-term fix. The Affordable Care Act is unaffordable. And I think we need to have this extension to give us time to work on something bigger and deeper and that will help lower costs overall. But I'm proud to work with Tom Suozzi on this. And I appreciate his partnership. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, I understand this is a two-year proposed extension of those enhanced premium tax credits and an income cap that phases out for those making between $200,000 to $400,000. But when you look at the breakdown, though, that's a pretty small portion of the overall recipients of the tax credits. It's like less than 10 percent. So what does this accomplish? How does this make it more affordable and fair? REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI (D-New York): Well, it helps everybody else who makes under $200,000 dramatically. And the number one concern people have in America is affordability. And health care affordability is right at the top of the list. MARGARET BRENNAN: How much more affordable? REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: So we need to do something to extend these premium tax credits. It'll save people thousands and thousands of dollars, literally $1,000 a month for some people. So it'll be dramatically more affordable. The people who make above $400,000 are the teeny little percentage of people that are not – a very small group of people that would benefit from the existing tax credits. Most of the people are below $200,000. That $200,000 to $400,000 is a way to taper it off, so there's not a cliff. MARGARET BRENNAN: And how much Democratic support do you have for this at this point? REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I think that Democrats are going to strongly back the idea of extending premium tax credits, so that we can keep people's insurance affordable. MARGARET BRENNAN: Even with these caps? REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: So, we have got to come up with this compromise and – even with the caps, yes.. People – Democrats have always said that they want to direct the policy towards lower- and middle-income folks. People making under $400,000 a year is our – our bread-and-butter issues, that we want to try and make things affordable for those folks. So – and that will be like literally 95 percent, 99 percent of the people that are affected right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Bacon, sorry. Go ahead. REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I was going to say, and Republicans, we pushed back on the thought of someone earning $600,000 getting all these tax credits. So when I listened to the Speaker – or Leader Thune, that was one of his big concerns on these. So that's why I wanted to ensure that we had this in our framework. MARGARET BRENNAN: But a tweak with a not permanent, just a two-year extension. Republicans haven't really been proposing a lot of alternative Obamacare options here. Do you think the entire system needs to be rebooted? And when will we see that plan? REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Well, I do think Republicans and Democrats are going to have to sit down at the table and figure out, what can we really do besides just throw more money at this? Right now, the premiums are just going up so much faster than inflation. It's unsustainable. And – but we can't do a Republican-only fix. It's not going to work. You're not going to get 60 votes in the Senate to do it. And I know some folks propose that back in Congress: Let's go up with our plan. Well, it can't just be a Republican plan if we want to pass something. So we got to sit down with Democrats and figure out, what can we do? And there's some good ideas out there. So, for example, I have heard, if we can directly subsidize high-risk people and put them in a separate pool and just lower their premiums through subsidies, and then the – let's call it the healthier folks, their premiums are going to go down significantly if we do that. So there's different concepts that we can do to – that can have an impact. But it's going to have to be a bipartisan way forward. It's not going to be a Republican-only bill, because you will never get it passed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Congressman Suozzi, I mean, Aetna pulled out… REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: … of the Obamacare marketplace this year after CVS said they expected to lose as much as $400 million. Other big insurance companies have been pulling out. If insurance companies themselves are having problems with Obamacare, do Democrats need to be more open to broader reforms of the Affordable Care Act? REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Yes, we absolutely should be looking at any kind of reform. I want to mend it, not end it. You know that over the past decade that there have been over 70 attempts, mainly by the Republicans, not guys like Don Bacon, who's a very reasonable guy, to try and get rid of Obamacare altogether. We think that's a terrible idea. But if people want to try and make it a better system to make health care more affordable in America and to get health care to more people, we should be doing that. That's what the people want. That's what reasonable people in Congress want. We should be working together to try and expand health care coverage, lower prices for everybody, and make health care more effective and less expensive for people. Now, that's not going to happen with everybody yelling and screaming at each other. Everybody who says ""Why don't you just?"" doesn't know what the hell they're talking about. You cannot solve complicated problems in an environment of fear and anger. You need reasonable people to sit down and talk to each other and say, I think this, well, I think that… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: … and then work your way towards finding compromise. Very hard to do in this toxic environment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: People like Don Bacon and other members of the Problem Solvers Caucus want to do that type of thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, but private health care costs are also going up. But on this topic of toxic environments here, Congressman Suozzi, Democrats, who won elections just a few days ago, credited their wins to this affordability issue and the message focused on that. Can you explain the focus this past week in the House by Democrats on the Jeffrey Epstein files? Is this a tactic to distract from the failure to extract health care changes or is there something else going on here? I mean, does the speaker putting it to a vote end this issue? REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I think it's a combination of factors, of people shining their lights on the most – the hot topic at the time. Jeffrey Epstein, of course, is an important topic. I'm sure I will vote to release his files, but that's not my priority. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: My priority is to focus on the things that the American people care about, affordability, immigration, taxes, crime, and health care. That's what people are fighting about. That's what they're concerned about. That's what we should be focused on in Congress. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Congressman Bacon, does the speaker putting this to a vote end the Epstein issue and get you back onto health care? I mean, the speaker said this is all a political exercise. Certainly, the families of the victims don't think it is. REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I think the speaker realizes the train has left the station on this. Let's rip the Band-Aid off and get it done. And I wish the president realized that. The more the White House pushes back on this, it's – it just looks bad, right? I mean, it was – the attorney general came out and said, all these white binders, we're going to release all this information, and then a month later said, oh, no, we're not. So it's been a P.R. blunder from the beginning. And I think the speaker is right. This is going to happen, so let's get it done and vote on it. And we got to realize it still has to go to the Senate. Then it has to go to the president for signature. Meanwhile, our Oversight Committee is releasing thousands and thousands of pages of evidence concerning Epstein. So, for example, like 3,000 pages was released late last week. So the Oversight Committee, Republicans and Democrats, are putting out the data. They're putting out subpoenas. I think it's already working, but, like Tom, when this comes on the floor, I'm going to vote yes on it. I want transparency. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well… REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: We want to protect the victims. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: But everything else should just be – should be open. MARGARET BRENNAN: You also, Congressman Bacon, run the Cyber Subcommittee. I want to ask you about something significant this past week, that A.I. firm Anthropic said that Chinese state-sponsored hackers used their technology to automate break-ins and carry out the first cyber espionage operation largely using A.I. It hit like 30 different companies. What can you tell us about the scope and the targets of this attack? REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I can't say much more than what was just released, other than I can say this. China has replaced Russia as most formidable cyber threat. They have much higher technology. They are using A.I., which gives you a lot more capability in finding weaknesses in your adversaries' cyber defenses. What concerns me more than anything, while China is attacking us every single day and Russia, we have had no commander in charge of Cyber Command for over eight months. The White House or the president fired the Cyber Command commander over eight months ago and has not replaced him. Also, the top two positions at the National Security Agency, the top two are vacant for over eight months. And we have been cutting CISA, which is the agency that protects our private sector, our businesses, our infrastructure, and we have cut it by about a third. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: And so our cyber capabilities are going backwards. We don't – we're rudderless in a time where China is attacking us every day. And that's something that really concerns me. And I have been pushing the White House to deal with this and to confront the cyber threat. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, we will continue following that important story. Congressmen, thank you for trying to be problem solvers with us today. REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to some of the challenges faced by the U.S. military. And we're joined by the Secretary of the Army, Dan Driscoll. Good morning. Thank you for being here. DANIEL DRISCOLL (U.S. Secretary of the Army): Thank you so much for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot to get to with you. Just quickly on news of day, the president did say he sort of made up his mind on Venezuela. I know this is the Marines, this is the Navy that are deployed. But does the Venezuelan army pose any kind of threat to the U.S. if action is taken? SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I think that the president and secretary of war have spent a lot of time thinking about, what is the best thing they can do for the American people? And I can speak from the Army's perspective, which is, we have a lot of training in that part of the world. We're reactivating our jungle school in Panama. We would be ready to act on whatever the president and secwar needed. MARGARET BRENNAN: But no orders beyond these exercises at this point? SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I – we don't talk about those kinds of things, but we would be ready if asked. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK. I do want to ask you about what has been happening with this shutdown. The government's now funded through January 30. You did get from Congress full- year funding for Veterans Affairs and military construction, a few other measures in this short-term bill. But in – we have seen the shutdown hit military bases and hit military families, costly, $400 million or more in emergency loans from USAA. How do you insulate the force so that the next shutdown doesn't hit these families the way it did this time? SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I think the shutdown is indicative of one of the bigger problems that we have a nation have had. And so if you look back for the last 30 or 40 years, one of the reasons we've had such bad outcomes, when we spend the American taxpayers' hard- earned dollars, and we go buy things that our soldiers will need to fight, when we build things where our soldiers and their families will live, we are such a bad customer, because when you're on the other side of the deal with us and you have to deal with shutdowns – I mean, this shutdown will take months and months for us to get back and going on these projects. And this is part of the calcification of our system that, under President Trump, we are uniquely able to try to go after a lot of these things and actually get our Army and their families living in better areas, and get our soldiers ready for the modern fight. And the shutdown does not help. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the modern fight. Tom Cotton, who is the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told our Olivia Gazis here at CBS that the threat to military sites and large civilian gatherings is severe and growing. He cited gaps in law enforcement authorities. Some of them lapsed during the shutdown, I understand. And he's talking about trying to close enforcement gaps when it comes to drones. What authorizations do you need? SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: So, under Secretary of War Hegseth, the United States Army has been put in charge of the counterdrone threat for the Pentagon. And then we are working hand in fist – or hand in glove with the broader law enforcement agencies. We just last week had a meeting right outside the White House, where what we are trying to do, because this problem is different from nearly anything we've faced in a long time. It is a flying IED. And so this IED… MARGARET BRENNAN: IED, the explosive. SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: IED, improvised explosive device. They're cheap. You can 3-D print them at home, and they cross borders incredibly quickly. And so what you basically need is a digital layer to exchange information and exchange sensing and allow the closest person on the ground or the closest effector on the ground to be able to take out a drone. And Senator Cotton is right. I mean, this is the threat of humanity's lifetime. What's occurring in Ukraine, what's happening in Russia, if you look at the speed and scale of the devastation that can come from drones, we as a federal government have got to lead on it. But I'm really optimistic. This is actually something we are doing right. We are partnering with both federal law enforcement. In a couple of weeks, we're having the Sheriff's Association come. We were just at the NYPD. We're including all of the different law enforcement agencies, thinking about the borders and the ports and the upcoming NFL games and Olympics and World Cup. Like, this is something we as a nation can lead on. And so, under President Trump's leadership, we are moving fast at this problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is about radar jamming of drones to take them out, not exploding them? SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: So you – the problem with the drone fight is, you need all sorts of layered defense. One solution does not work. If you just try to jam them, if you look at what's happening in Ukraine, people have started to hardwire drones. And so you can't do R.F. jamming on a hardwired drone. And so there are things like net guns that are coming back. We're using all sorts of solutions and tools, and it makes it even more complicated when you're by an airport and you're doing it in your own homeland. You just have different authorities. And so a lot of this is a human problem of communication, command and control and having a layered set of solutions that you can use for any given problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're talking about here at the homeland, things like the U.S. hosting the Olympics, the World Cup, even just the Super Bowl games that are coming up. SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Should there be restrictions in this country on who is able to own and operate drones? SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I'm pretty optimistic that we will be able to figure out a solution where we will know what is in the sky at every moment across our country all at once. And so if you think of the president's… MARGARET BRENNAN: But we're not there yet. SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: We're not there yet. But under the president's Golden Dome, I would think about this like a golden mini dome, where, if you took one of the sites for the World Cup, we are heavily focused on being able to see everything in the area, have all of the interceptors we will need, have all of the training for all of the different forces that will have to be able to act. And so to your specific question, I think we are trying to design a system so that Americans are able to fly drones, so that commercial companies like Amazon – like, the future of delivery, in a lot of ways, is commercial drones. And so we will just have to deconflict the skies, working with the FAA. But this is a big topic. I check in with Secretary of War Hegseth on this almost weekly. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when we last saw the president of Ukraine, Zelenskyy, at the White House, he brought up to President Trump, on camera, we've got great drones we want to sell to the United States or provide to the United States. You referred to Ukraine as the only Silicon Valley of warfare right now. What do you mean by that? Are they really ahead of the United States on innovation? SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I think, if you look at what's happening, Operation Spider's Web in Russia, the Ukrainians used probably a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of drones and took out almost $10 billion worth of equipment in Russia. And Russia's in that fight. And so I think what is amazing about our country is, we are able to recognize where we need to innovate quickly. And what we're doing for drones, completely differently, I think, than we have done as an army in probably 50 or 60 years, is, we are welcoming in American industry. So we just did an A.I. war game where we invited 15 of the top CEOs in the nation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: They were worth probably $18 trillion in enterprise value. And we said, how do you – can you please help us? What do you have in your tech innovation pipeline to help us with data in contested environments? How do we do logistics 6,000 miles away if we're facing an enemy who's trying to contest us? And we are working with them, no joke, daily to basically take their innovation and apply it to this problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what I heard you saying there is, you look at the battlefield in Ukraine as kind of like a test lab for where warfare is going. SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Yes. Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you convince some of your fellow Republicans that there is value in that fight, in terms of, you know, those who are so isolationist they don't want to be involved in Ukraine, even financially? SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Well, I don't think I have talked to a single person who has said we shouldn't be learning from what's occurring in Ukraine. All of our equipment, all of the exquisite features we will need are definitionally going to come – the data set that the Ukrainians are getting for their generative A.I. models of when they have drones and they're flying and they're learning and they're doing counterdrone, and they're taking all of this information from their sensors and trying to figure out what's going on. There's not a single person I know that doesn't think that is an incredible treasure trove of information for future warfare. I think a lot of the questions are, how do we actually execute on the president's agenda of peace in that part of the world? Where – I have not been to the White House where it has not come up that we just want peace, so that the American industrial base can thrive everywhere. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: And we have to focus on that part of the world unnecessarily right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're at the Department of War. SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you announced that the Army wants to buy a million drones over the next two to three years. Navy, Marines, Air Force, they will obviously be very involved in any war in the Pacific, but you've got to defend those American bases. SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: So how do you think of the threat from China there? Because I have read that you think they're ahead of America. SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: So we're working on something with Congress called SkyFoundry. And basically the idea is to, again, do it right from the beginning. What the Army has historically gotten wrong in the last couple of decades is, we're either all in or all out, meaning we either use our organic industrial base and we make the drones ourselves, or we say, this is too complicated for us, we're going to have private industry do it. We are not doing that with drones, because, if you look at – Ukraine is manufacturing four million a year. China, I think, is at 12 to 14 million drones a year. MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow. SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: And we as a nation will have to have our private sector able to help us. And so what we are going to do is, we are going to invest in things like sensors and brushless motors and circuit boards and a lot of the components that are really hard for the private sector to get right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: The United States Army is going to build those on our bases and empower the private sector to purchase from us. And so we will make drones, our private partners will make drones, and we will catch up and surpass the Chinese incredibly quickly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary, thank you for your time. And I do want to make the point that you are taking questions. And that is unusual these days, since the Pentagon has restricted access to reporters. And we think it's important here that the American people hear about their own security as well as the military's three million or more employees. So thank you. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration has launched another immigration enforcement operation, this time in Charlotte, North Carolina, a blue city with one of the fastest growing immigrant populations in the country. The operation, called Charlotte's Web by the Department of Homeland Security, started Saturday. Federal agents from the CBP, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, have been seen making arrests, questioning gardeners, patrolling a Home Depot parking lot, and smashing windows. Trump administration officials tell our immigration reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez that New Orleans is the next Border Patrol operation planned for this month. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to ""FACE THE NATION."" On Friday, we spoke with the chairman of one of the Senate committees responsible for crafting health care legislation. Louisiana's Bill Cassidy, who is also a doctor. We began by showing him what the president is thinking of for a health care fix. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (President Of The United States): I'm calling today for insurance companies not to be paid, but for the money, this massive amount of money, to be paid directly to the people of our country, so that they can buy their own health care, which will be far better and far less expensive than the disaster known as Obamacare. (END VIDEO CLIP) MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you, Senator, coordinating with the White House on this proposal? SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): So, we're absolutely in communication with the White House and with the administration, because there's a lot of stuff that you have to work out to do that. But let me give a little meat on the bones of what the president's speaking about. If you look at an Obamacare policy now, there's a $6,000 deductible. Democrats are fighting to lower the premiums. You lower a premium on something which has a $6,000 deductible, it's basically a catastrophic policy. Now, I like to speak to the cost of being insured, not just the cost of the health insurance. The president is proposing that we take the $26 billion that would be going to insurance companies if we just do a straight out extension. And, by the way, 20 percent of that $26 billion, 20 percent will go for profit and administration overhead. Give it directly to the American people in an account in which 100 percent of the money is used for them to purchase health care on their own terms. Now – now, that makes them an informed consumer. It also helps address the need to have coverage for that deductible. And if they get that policy with a higher deductible, they can actually lower their premium. It's a sweet spot. Lower premiums help with the deductible, making the patience the informed consumer. The president and I are united. We should all be united about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president' economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, was on this program last Sunday. He said the president was just brainstorming, things aren't formally put together among Republica senators yet. But I just want to clarify what you are coordinating with the president on here because, is it to buy your own insurance policy which is kind of complicated, or is it, to use this flexible spending account you've talked about for related health care needs, like a – are there restrictions on how you can use that money? SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: So, first, there's two types of premium tax credits. There's the baseline premium tax credit, which was part of Obamacare. That would stay in effect and people would still buy a policy, for example, they get in a car wreck, something disastrous, they need somebody negotiating on their behalf with all the providers. That stays the same. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: What we're talking about, and the shutdown was over, the enhanced premium tax credits. Policies have become so expensive under Obamacare that under Joe Biden Democrats passed another subsidy on top of the first subsidy. That's what we're fighting about. And what Republicans are saying, and I'd like to hope Democrats will too. Hey, wait a second, if we can have lower premiums and help people with their deductible, by giving the money directly to the patient, by the way, 20 percent doesn't go for insurance company profit and overhead, 100 percent goes for health care, why don't we unite Republicans and Democrats in doing that? That's where the president is. You've got to figure some things out, but we're a lot farther along than you might imagine. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you want it fix Obamacare, or do you want to eliminate Obamacare? SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: First, you have to, like, we're going into 2026. That's like a month and a half from now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: And so you've got to work with what you have. But on the other hand, Obamacare was a top-heavy – administratively heavy type system in which a lot of money is – a lot of money and responsibility is taken from individuals and given to insurance companies as one example. I'm a doctor. I worked for 20 years in a hospital for the uninsured. I found that if you give the patient the power, good things happen. That's supported, by the way, by the medical literature. If the patient is engaged in her health care and the health care of her family, she's going to be a wise shopper, wise for her health and wise for her pocketbook. We need to have a new model. And that model is to engage the patient in her own health care. Doing so is good for her and good for us all. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but you said we – we need to work with what we have. That is, as you just said, you have a short amount of time before the – the end of the year. Do you think you need to extend the health care tax subsidies that are currently in place until you figure out all the rest of this complicated policy making? SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Let me back you up a little bit, Margaret, to say, everybody assumes it's easy just to extend the premium tax credits. The enhanced premium tax credits. It's not that easy. Fifty percent of the states did not plan on them being extended, and they don't have rates as if they were to be extended. So, that means if we pass this mid-December, they've got to recalculate rates in time for, wait a second, by that time we're already into 2026. It's not an easy matter. And, by the way, did I mention, the policies that people want to lower their premiums for have $6,000 deductibles? It is basically something for insurance companies to make money off of, and for the individual to wade through $6,000 of debt before they can finally access it. Now, the kind of proposal I am proposing, Republicans are, and I hope Democrats will join, is let's take that money, and we have a mechanism to do so. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: We giving it to the patient. By giving her that money, she can choose a bronze level plan, with is to say lower premiums. So, now her premiums are down, but she has money in an account to help with the deductible. And I think we can figure that out about as easily we can figure out what we would do if we just did a straight out extension. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want to do all this, though, by the second week of December, when the Democrats have been promised they'll have a vote on an ACA bill of their choice? SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Yes. And I tell my Democratic colleagues, first, let's not be Democrats and Republicans. Let's be Americans representing all of Americans. Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies. But we can do it better with lower premiums and with money in accounts to pay deductibles. And then why don't we come together? There's going to be a Democratic bill and a Republican bill and both fail. Let's do an American bill where the American people benefit. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: And let's work together, collaborate, to lower those premiums and to help them with that first dollar coverage and the – and the deductible. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we looked and there are about 293,000 Louisianans, your state, enrolled in Obamacare currently. Six weeks from now, those expanded tax credits that you've been talking about will go away for individuals making $62,000 or above. Individuals making less than that amount will see their tax credits shrink. So, are you telling those hundreds of thousands in Louisiana that that tax credit is going away no matter what? That they should make plans for higher prices? SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: No. I'm telling them that we are working to make it work better for them. And they would tell you, by the way, wait a second, I got a $6,000 deductible. That does not work for me. Margaret, I'm a doctor. I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, I can't afford that, my deductible is too high. That's reality. And that reality is being lost in this discussion. We've got to do something about sky-high deductible. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Maybe you can afford the premium. You can't afford the policy. Let's lower the cost of having health insurance, focusing by not just on the premium, but the deductible, and I think we can do both. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, even in the private market, health care costs have gone up about six to nine percent when you look at the projections. SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Oh, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: But I want to ask you about your oversight rule. Secretary Kennedy has this hand-picked panel of vaccine advisers, you know them at ACIP, they're going to meet in a few days and potentially vote on changing the hepatitis b vaccine schedule for infants. That same vaccine advisory group is also considering the safety of vaccine ingredients, like aluminum, which would impact a number of childhood shots. This should matter for American parents. Are you comfortable with what they are about to put to a vote? SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I'm very concerned about this. As it turns out, my medical practice focused on hepatitis b. And so, we know that because of a recommended dose at birth of hepatitis b vaccine, recommended not mandated, the number of children born contracting hepatitis b at birth or shortly thereafter has decreased from about 20,000 20 years ago to like 200 now. That's 20 – effectively a clerical error. We have decreased the incidents of chronic hepatitis b by 20,000 people over the last two decades with this kind of recommendation. And by the way, if you're infected at birth, you're more likely – you're 95 percent likely to become a chronic carrier. The vaccine is safe. It has been established. And these ingredients they're speaking of have been shown to be safe. This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis b or who've grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incident of hepatitis b is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels. I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease. I want people to be healthy. I want to make America healthy. And you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president of the United States also told American women not to take Tylenol or give it to their kids. This is based on a theory that it causes autism somehow. And he also, in a social media post, the same one, called for the measles, mumps, and rubella shot to be broken up into three different shots. That was then endorsed by the acting CDC director. Are you concerned by this kind of suggestive linkage at the top of the CDC and from the White House? SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Again, I'm a doctor, and so I'm going to go where the evidence takes me. And the best evidence is a study out of Sweden with two million children that found no – no causality, no association, if you will, between taking Tylenol in pregnancy and getting autism. And, of course, that concerns me, because there's going to be a mama out there, again, I'm a doctor, I talk to – I talk to patients in a – in a room. And her child has autism. She took Tylenol for a high fever during pregnancy and now blames herself. That's just the way mamas think. And that's wrong. We don't want her to think that. The best evidence, that there is no relationship. By the way, if you have a high fever during pregnancy, that may be a risk for autism. Now, of course, if you're pregnant, talk to your physician before you take anything. But point being, the best evidence is that there's no relationship between the two. And I don't want women putting themselves on a guilt trip when the best evidence shows not. By the way, the president has spoken out strongly in favor of immunizations in other cases. And I noted when he got his physical, he got the flu and covid shots. So, the president has demonstrated that he believes in immunization. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's why clarifying these statements, I think, is important, since you interpret them differently. I wonder, do you regret your confirmation vote for Secretary Kennedy? SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I smile because every reporter asks me that. You live life forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, because these questions run right into a pledge that you extracted from him not to tinker with some of the structures that were set in place to have oversight of these vaccines and this process. SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Yes, so you live life forward. Again, you just do. Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra processed food that has frankly never received this sort of attention before. And people praise him for that. So, he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others. And so – so, that's how I'll answer your question. MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like yes. Is – if this is your final year in office, sir, will you make overhauling health care your top priority? SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Well, I sure hope it's not my final year in office. But I have been thinking about health care for 30 years, because when I worked in a public hospital for the uninsured, I saw the burden it could be on middle income families who have middle income but couldn't afford the insurance or couldn't afford the health care. And so, it's been my priority for 30 years. And I will continue to do that. And if there is a silver lining – if there's a silver lining in the shutdown we just had, the silver lining is now we are focused on, how do we make health care more affordable for the American people? That should be our goal, not to be partisan one way or the other. How do we make it more affordable for fellow Americans? If we can accomplish that, I will feel like I have done my job. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time. And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-NH): Good morning. Nice to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have spent a good part of the past year trying to get legislation through to extend those Obamacare tax credit subsidies. Last Sunday you crossed the aisle. You agreed to reopen the government, end the shutdown without a guaranteed extension, but with a promise to have some kind of vote on an ACA bill of Democrats own choosing. Do you have consensus among Democrats that this needs to be a vote simply to extend the tax credits as they stand now, or are you open to a broader reform of Obamacare? SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: From the beginning this shutdown, I have had two goals, one is to get the government up and running again to end the suffering that too many Americans were experiencing because they lost food assistance or they weren't getting paid, federal employees, and the second was to address the high cost of premium – health insurance that people are looking at because insurance companies are setting rates based on the fact that those premium tax credits are not – are supposed to go away at the end of this year. I think people are now very aware of the fact that they are going to see huge rate increases, double for so many people, and an unaffordable cost of health insurance if those premium tax credits go away. And what I think we need to do, and these are conversations that we need to have, is we need to work with our Republican colleagues to try and get a bill that can be supported, that can get through both houses of Congress where we've been talking to our Republicans, Senator Cassidy, throughout the shutdown about what we might be able to agree to. We've been talking to House members on both sides of the aisle. And so now we need to work together. I agree with Senator Cassidy, this should be a bill that is not partisan, but it should be a bill to extend those premium tax credits because, as everybody has talked about, there is real urgency to get this done. And if we don't address it, then people are going to see huge rate increases. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: So, we can work together. We can extend the credits, but we probably can't implement significant reforms that Senator Cassidy was talking about in the time frame that we've got. So, we need to look, both in the short-term and in the long-term for how we address the cost of health care. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so that's an important point there. So, the $26 billion or so that he talks about as the cost for extension of these that he wants to redirect into these cash accounts, these flexible accounts, you're saying, you can't get that done in six weeks' time? SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: No, you can't. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And, again, there's real urgency to do this. There's some good, bipartisan legislation that has come out of committee in the Senate that I think we should take up, things that would expedite approval of generic drugs and biosimilars, that would address PBM reform, which is a huge cost increase for health care. But that's a longer term issue. Right now we need to address what people are facing in terms of those high rate increases because of the threats that these premium tax credits are going to end. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to put a fine point on it. When we heard the congressmen at the top of the program talking about, you know, caps on income and restrictions on who can benefit from those tax credits, can you get your fellow Democrats, who, by the way, are pretty angry at each other, angry at you as well, about this decision to reopen the government, can you get everyone on board, or can you at least get to 60 votes to be able to extend those subsidies with tweaks? SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, first of all, we need to put the shutdown behind us, end the circular firing squad, and remember why we're in this situation. We're in this situation because Donald Trump and Speaker Johnson and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate have refused to address the cost of health care and are trying to throw people off their health care. Can we get to consensus? Well, we need to if we're going to get a bipartisan bill out of the Congress. I think we've seen and heard from health insurance companies that implementing significant changes in the first year is going to be really difficult to do, almost impossible. But we ought to be able to agree on some changes, like capping the income of people who receive those premium tax credits. Right now 94 percent of people who get the credits earn under $200,000 a year. And the average income for a single recipient is about a little over $30,000 a year. So, most people who are getting these tax credits are not in that high income level. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And so we should be able to agree on that. We should be able to agree that we don't want any fraud and abuse in the program. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: That's something Republicans and Democrats believe in. So, let's focus on what we can agree to. Let's look at what we can get done in the time frame we have, and recognize there is real urgency to get these premium tax credits extended. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're going to have this vote around the second week of December, but premiums are already notified out. SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: They are already sort of baked in here for – certainly for Americans who buy government health care. Is it too late to extend open enrollment? I mean Senator Cassidy was saying, like, ship has sailed here. SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: No, we could actually decide that we were willing, as part of this legislation, to extend open enrollment. Obviously, we need support from the administration. But insurance companies, in meeting with the insurance industry, they've indicated that while it would be difficult, they could address some of the challenges around not getting agreement until December. Again, that's why there's urgency to get this done. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about another matter. Survivors of convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as some of the families of those survivors, wrote a letter to lawmakers supporting the release of Justice Department internal communications in regard to his case. In that letter they said, ""there was no middle ground here. There was no hiding behind party affiliation. We will remember your decision at the ballot box."" You know this House vote is set to come up this week. Should there be a vote in the Senate? And would you support it to see the release of these documents? SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Absolutely. We need to release the documents. The American people need to see what's in them. And if President Trump says there's nothing there that he's concerned about, then why doesn't he support release of the documents? MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see if the Republican leader in the Senate takes up your proposal there. There has not been a commitment to have that kind of vote. But on Venezuela, since you are ranking member on Senator Foreign Relations, I want to make sure I ask you, the president has said he has sort of made up his mind on what to do about Venezuela. You were one of the very few senators who have received briefings within the past few weeks from Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth regarding the strikes that are being carried out on these small, fast-moving boats. Is there a clear end game here? And is your understanding that ousting Nicolas Maduro from power is part of the administration's plan? SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think it's clear what the end game is for this administration with respect to Venezuela. They are relying on a legal opinion – excuse me, in terms of the boat strikes that they have not released. They have finally made it available to members of Congress, but they haven't released it to the public. They are escalating in a way that - - talking about a land strike through special operations that puts at risk our men and women in the military. We have so much fire power now in the Caribbean, the Gerald R. Ford has been taken from the Red Sea so that now we don't have any fire power really in the Middle East as we look at the threats there. We don't have what we need, I think, in the Indo-Pacific, or in Europe. And so, what the president has done here is to put at risk other parts of the world and Americans in other parts of the world for this fascination on trying to get rid of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, who clearly is a bad character. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: He's been involved in drug – MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Illegal drugs. But he is not a threat to the United States of America. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And what the president is doing is raising real questions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Shaheen, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week. For ""FACE THE NATION,"" I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS)",left
"What to know about Trump's promise of $2,000 tariff dividend payments Questions abound about who qualifies and whether enough funds are available. President Donald Trump over the weekend vowed to provide each American a $2,000 dividend to be distributed from what he said was tariff revenue. ""A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” the president wrote on social media Sunday, in part. Within hours, however, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cast doubt on the plan, saying the payout could merely refer to tax savings enshrined by Trump's signature domestic spending measure. A tariff dividend may come ""in lots of forms,"" Bessent told ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, adding that he had not spoken with Trump about the proposal. The idea of a potential tariff dividend -- reminiscent of pandemic-era stimulus checks -- has raised questions about who would qualify and what to make of the Trump administration’s mixed signals about the proposal. Some economists questioned whether the dividend is achievable with available tariff funds. Here's what to know about the proposed $2,000 tariff dividends. What is a dividend? The term ""dividend"" typically describes a payout to individual shareholders, funded by a company's profits. In this case, the concept functions in a similar fashion, indicating payouts to Americans that are funded by tax raised by Trump's far-reaching tariffs. The proposal mirrors the three stimulus checks mailed to Americans during the pandemic, two of which were authorized by Trump. Those three payments totaled as much as $3,200 per tax filer, as well as $2,500 per child, according to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, a watchdog established by Congress. What did Trump say about a potential $2,000 tariff dividend? Trump announced the policy proposal in a brief message on social media on Sunday morning, focused on tariff-related tax revenue. ""People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k's are Highest EVER,"" the president wrote. ""A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone."" The message did not specify who would qualify for the payout or how the policy would operate. Who would qualify for the $2,000 dividend? It is not clear who would qualify for the payout, though Trump said the measure would exclude ""high income people."" The pandemic-era stimulus checks enacted by Trump were made available to individuals bringing in as much as $75,000 per year and couples earning up to $150,000. Beyond those benchmarks, higher earners were eligible for smaller payments. Last year, median U.S. household income was $83,730, the Census Bureau found. Did Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cast doubt on the dividend checks? Hours after Trump's announcement, Bessent appeared to throw cold water on the likelihood of tariff-related dividend checks. On Sunday, Bessent suggested the $2,000 savings may instead be rooted in tax cuts previously enshrined by Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill legislation, which he signed into law on July 4. ""It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility on auto loans. Those are substantial deductions that are being financed in the tax bill,"" Bessent told ABC News' ""This Week"" Sunday. ""The real goal of tariffs is to rebalance trade and make it more fair,"" Bessent added. The dueling remarks from Trump and Bessent come days after the Supreme Court heard arguments about whether a president has the constitutional authority to unilaterally levy tariffs. Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Solicitor General John Sauer downplayed the revenue-raising component of the policy, saying the tariffs do not encroach upon the taxing power afforded to Congress under the Constitution. ""The fact that [the tariffs] raise revenue is only incidental,"" Sauer told the justices. Has the U.S. raised enough tariff revenue to fund $2,000 checks? If Trump were to make the dividend payments available to anyone earning $100,000 or less, the policy would reach about 150 million Americans, amounting to roughly $300 billion in dividends, Erica York, a policy expert at the Tax Foundation, said in a post on X. As of Sept. 30, the federal government had generated $195 billion in tariff-related revenue, according to the Treasury Department. By that math, the estimated $300 billion cost of the dividend check proposal would far exceed the amount of currently available tariff revenue. When factoring in only revenue generated by Trump's new levies and deducting some negative budgetary impact from those policies, York estimated net tariff revenues of only $90 billion, falling even shorter of the $300 billion required. Moreover, depending on how the Supreme Court may rule regarding Trump's legal authority to levy tariffs, the White House may be forced to return tens of billions of dollars in revenue to importers who paid the tax, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found. In theory, however, the Trump administration could promise to pay the dividend from anticipated tariff revenue. The Treasury Department has forecast $3 trillion in tariff revenue over the next decade. Should the Trump administration choose that route, the dividend payments would add to the federal debt, which currently stands at over $38 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",left
"How do you say “Taco” – as in “Trump Always Chickens Out” – in Portuguese? It is a question some Brazilians might ask now, with a smile. Four months ago, US President Donald Trump announced 40 per cent additional tariffs on Brazilian imports (creating 50 per cent total levies), because he was furious about the country’s legal investigation into Jair Bolsonaro, its former president, and its clampdown on US Big Tech. But president Lula da Silva defiantly hit back at the bullying – boosting his domestic popularity – and defended the courts. A Brazilian judge has now sent Bolsonaro to jail. And those tariffs? Last week, Trump declared that “certain agricultural imports from Brazil should no longer be subject to the additional [40 per cent surcharge]”. In plain English: Lula won. READ MORE There are at least three lessons here. The first is that the White House seems to be becoming more nervous about cost-of-living pressures. No wonder: recent surveys show that consumer sentiment is slumping in tandem with Trump’s approval rating. His team is scrambling to find ways to reduce grocery prices – and cutting agricultural tariffs is an obvious move. The second lesson is that bullies often respond to strength. Yes, craven flattery can sometimes work, too; Switzerland reduced its own tariffs by sending gift-laden, grovelling executives to meet Trump. But China has pursued a path of belligerence with notable results. And Brazil’s defiance suggests that others are learning from Beijing. If nothing else, this suggests that anyone dealing with Trump should start by assessing how to exploit his weak spots. Third: it pays to distinguish between tactics and goals when looking at the White House. That might not sound obvious, given Trump often seems to be woefully short of clear strategy. Indeed, his stance on Brazil, Ukraine and the Jeffrey Epstein case – to name but a few issues – has been so capricious that unpredictability is arguably the only predictable trait. And – unsurprisingly – many critics interpret this policy capriciousness as either a sign of gross incompetence or personality disorders, or both; like a Tudor king, Trump’s narcissistic whims appear to drive his “court”. But I think a more helpful frame is to borrow advice given to new recruits at some US investment banks, namely to try to identify in any action a hierarchy of “goals”, “strategies” and “tactics”. For, while Trump does not operate with clearly articulated policy goals of the sort that a banker might recognise, he is certainly driven by strong instincts. Most notably, his Make America Great Again tag reflects a consistent desire to achieve extreme economic and political dominance, for both the country and his inner circle. (As befits a quasi-king, these two often seem intertwined.) Moreover, this instinct is being turned into strategies by advisers. These can be contradictory, partly because of fights between White House factions. However their leitmotif is “geoeconomic” policymaking, ie a desire to use economic policies to bolster hegemonic power, in a way that repudiates both late 20th-century neoliberal thinking and the collaborative postwar Bretton Woods approach. Even if you scoff at Trump, it pays to separate the signal from the noise And this strategy not only uses networks to fight for dominance, as the political scientists Grégoire Mallard and Jin Sun have observed, but also jumbles up economics, politics, culture, tech, military and individual grievances. Hence Trump’s attempt to use tariffs to force Brazil to release Bolsonaro, or his ally’s threat to impose tariffs on Norway after its sovereign wealth fund divested from Caterpillar. Beneath this, there are also tactics. These echo the modus operandi Trump used to cut deals in business: bullying, threats, melodrama, policy swings, favouritism and “flood the zone” announcements, to cite the president’s former strategist Steve Bannon. Those aggressive tactics grab attention; indeed, they are planned to do so. But eye-catching or not, they should not be confused with goals or strategies. The aim is to gain leverage against rivals in a transactional world. These tools do not always work. Hence that “Taco” quip, which arose because Trump has often watered down tariff threats. But it is precisely because these melodramatic moves are often tactics – not deeply held ideological goals – that the White House feels able to pivot without a blush, discarding moves if they backfire or bigger priorities emerge. That’s why Brazilian tariffs suddenly vanished last week, and why Trump has just embraced Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected New York mayor, after viciously attacking him. Of course, some observers might dismiss this analysis as mere “sane washing”, an effort to make the White House team seem more logical than they really are. Fair enough; I would not deny the capricious nature of Trump. But the key point is this: even if you scoff at Trump, it pays to separate the signal from the noise. In that sense, Lula’s triumph has sent some distinctly encouraging signals for the Europeans and others. Kings are rarely as all-powerful as they seem. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025",left
"Sellers in other countries struggle to maintain US customers as holiday shopping season starts Small businesses are struggling to adapt since the U.S. ended the ""de minimis"" exemption on Aug. 29, which allowed imports under $800 to be tariff-free NEW YORK -- At Fleece & Harmony, a woolen mill and yarn shop in bucolic Belfast, Prince Edward Island, in Canada, owner Kim Doherty used to be able to send yarn skeins to U.S. customers across the border with little fanfare. The yarn orders usually met an import tax exemption for packages valued at under $800, meaning it could be imported tariff-free and avoid the customs process. But ever since the Trump administration eliminated the exemption as of Aug. 29, the cost to send yarn to U.S. customers has skyrocketed. The bill for a $21 ball of yarn now includes $12 to $15 in brokerage fees that her shipper UPS charges, plus state taxes and a 6.5% tariff, all of which almost doubles her costs. “We had orders that have reached the customers and they’re in shock about the fact that they have to pay,” she said. “And it’s amazing how many people really didn’t know what the impact was going to be.” Getting rid of the so-called de minimis exemption was meant to curb drug trafficking and stop low-quality goods from discount sellers like Temu and Shein flooding the U.S. market. But as the all-important annual holiday shopping season kicks off, it is putting a crimp on small businesses and shoppers now facing higher costs. Chad Lundquist in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, ordered fragrance oil from a site called Oil Perfumery in October, but he didn't realize the business was based in Toronto, Canada. His total was $35.75, which included an $8 standard shipping fee. But when his package arrived, he was hit with a $10.80 tariff bill from FedEx. “It wasn’t worth the $10 tariff for a $27 purchase,” Lundquist said. Oil Perfumery did not respond to a request for comment. He's not the only skittish shopper. Three months after the exemption ended, sellers abroad are reporting drastic declines in U.S. sales. Some are paying the duties themselves instead of passing them to consumers. They are also trying to focus on domestic customers to replace U.S. ones and adjusting product lineups to feature best selling items to try to goose sales. Martha Keith, founder of British stationery brand Martha Brook, which is based in London with a small office in Melbourne, Australia, said U.S. sales from her Etsy store — her main e-commerce channel in addition to her own website — were up 50% for the year before the exemption ended. But sales fell dramatically when the tariffs hit, and continue to drop even though she’s paying the import taxes and customs fees herself so customers aren't impacted. Sales are down about 30% year-over-year. “The issue seems to be in customer confidence hitting the desire to order from businesses outside of the U.S., because of confusion about how the tariffs will affect them,” Keith said. She’s also in a bind because she sold a £109 ($144) stationery advent calendar to about 200 U.S. customers ahead of the tariffs, and now she has to ship them. Shipping and tariffs will cost a combined £25 ($33), meaning Keith will have to find an additional £5,000 ($6,583) to cover shipping the advent calendars already sold. “The whole thing has been a bit of a nightmare for businesses like ours, and such a huge shame, as the U.S. market was such a valuable growth area for us, particularly through Etsy,” she said. The timing was particularly bad for Sue Bacarro, who along with her sister co-owns Digi Wildflowers, an Etsy shop that sells embroidered baby blankets, gifts and custom quilts for wedding and anniversaries, located across the border from Detroit in Windsor, Ontario. Before the announcement of the removal of the de minimis exemption, they placed a large inventory order to prepare for the holiday season and early 2026 demand. But when the de minimis exemption ended, “inventory wasn’t moving as expected, and we suspected customers were hesitant to purchase due to potential duty charges,” Bacarro said. Sales — 70% of which come from Americans — finally started to rebound when Digi Wildflowers prominently added a banner on its site that said, “U.S. Import Duties On Us.” “Heading into this holiday season, we’re keeping that message front and center through banners, social media, and direct communication,” said Bacarro, who is also expanding their product line. But not all businesses can — or want to — pick up the tariff tab. Kim Doherty, who runs the woolen mill on Prince Edward Island, doesn't plan to pay the tariff and fees for her customers. “I’m not in a position as a small business owner to do that. The profit margins are already rather thin,” said Doherty, adding that “on principle,” she shouldn't have to do it. Right now, her shipments to U.S. customers are about 10% of what they were. Instead, she’s working on expanding her fiber offerings to Canadian customers at her brick-and-mortar store and fiber festivals. “We’ll see what happens,” she said. “I’m pretty sure that my U.S. customers were shopping and not even thinking about it, but now they’ll be evaluating the purchases that they’re making, knowing that they are going to have the extra fees on top of whatever they see.” Some Etsy businesses have been stymied by international postal services temporarily halting deliveries to the U.S. because of the confusion around the ending of de minimis. Selene Pierangelini’s business, Apricot Rain Creations, based in Brisbane, Australia, which sells crystals, candles, and spiritual wellness products on Etsy, depended on the Australia Post to get deliveries to U.S. customers. More than three-fourths of her customer base comes from the U.S. Australia Post suspended service to the U.S. for about a month, resuming on Sept. 22. She temporarily switched to FedEx and UPS — private shippers that are more expensive than Australia Post. Since it resumed, Australia Post is working with Zonos, a provider of cross-border shipping technology, to offer a shipping calculator that lets her prepay duties and fees. They themselves charge a fee of $1.69 plus 10% of the total duty fee. So far, the items she ships from Australia have been tariffed at a 10% rate, the baseline tariff for the country. She increased her shipping costs to help cover the expense. It is manageable, but tricky, she said. “You don’t really know how much (the cost) is going to be until the package clears custom in the U.S., and you get an invoice which is automatically paid out of your account,” she said. And her sales have not recovered. Before the tariffs, her U.S. sales were about 85% of her total sales, and now they’re around 35%. She’s hopeful people are just holding off until Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday sales. In the meantime, she has restarted sales to Europe, which she had paused in 2024 due to increased regulations. And she's launched a Facebook marketing campaign and is exploring print-on-demand services from U.S.-based providers for production and fulfillment. “This situation highlights how fragile small businesses can be when dependent on one market,” Pierangelini said. “While it has been a shock, it’s also pushed me to diversify — something that will hopefully make my business stronger and more resilient in the long run.”",left
"Nintendo has made some of the most iconic video games of all time, but building a library of the standouts can quickly become expensive, especially given that many titles don’t often go on sale at a significant discount. The good news is that Nintendo is already running a holiday sale in the run-up to Black Friday, allowing you to save on Nintendo Switch games, amiibo, and accessories through November 28th. Some of the best Nintendo Switch games are up to $30 off for Black Friday You can also grab a handful of discounted amiibo, including a few based on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. You can also grab a handful of discounted amiibo, including a few based on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The biggest news is that Nintendo and select retailers are offering some of the Switch’s best games — including Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom — for as little as $29.99, which amounts to a healthy $30 discount. In some cases, these games are at their lowest price ever, and we don’t expect any of them to be this heavily discounted again until “MAR10 Day” rolls around next year. Typically, Nintendo offers a discount on a Switch bundle that includes a digital copy of Mario Kart: 8 Deluxe or some other first-party title, but that doesn’t seem to be happening this year. The company has openly admitted that it’s shifting its focus to the Switch 2 — which isn’t on sale and isn’t expected to be anytime soon — and recently raised the price of the original Switch due to President Trump’s tariff policy. Sadly, no Switch 2 games are part of the promo; however, you can play the discounted OG Switch titles on Nintendo’s latest console. Plus, if you are looking for deals related to the Switch 2, Woot is still running a video game promo through the end of today, November 23rd, giving you a chance to save on newer releases like Mario Kart World and the Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Super Mario Odyssey Super Mario Odyssey is one of the crowning achievements of the original Switch thanks to its tight platforming, ingenious level design, and a game mechanic that lets you control certain enemies and parts of the environment. There are still bosses to battle and coins to collect, but Odyssey feels like a breath of fresh air. Princess Peach: Showtime!

Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Donkey Kong Country HD is the definitive version of the tough-as-nails platformer, which initially launched on the Wii in 2016. Don’t let the game’s cartoonish art, bopping soundtrack, and side-scrolling gameplay fool you, though; it will test your skills. That said, it’s still a blast to work your way through the game’s tougher sections, which require both precision and patience. Read our review. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Echoes of Wisdom finally lets you play as Nintendo’s titular heroine. The game’s basic premise revolves around trying to save the world using the fabled Tri Rod, an item that allows you to replicate the spirits of items and enemies you encounter along the way. The game mixes the top-down perspective of 2D Zelda games with gameplay from the series’ newer, open-world 3D entries. Read our review. Luigi’s Mansion 3 Luigi’s Mansion 3 is the series’s most ambitious title, even though it retains the Luigi-as-a-Ghostbuster gameplay the series has employed since 2001. It takes place in a haunted hotel overrun with ghosts. To deal with them, you’ll need the help of Gooigi, a doppelgänger made of goop that can help you explore every nook and cranny.

Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is generally regarded as the best Mario RPG, and the Switch remake is well worth revisiting. Mario has more paper-like abilities than he did in the original Paper Mario game (including the option to turn into a paper airplane), and Nintendo didn’t feel the need to shake up the battle system or other gameplay elements like they did in subsequent entries. Splatoon 3 Splatoon 3 is the latest entry in Nintendo’s paint-laden shooter franchise, and the hook this time around is a deeper single-player mode. You’ll assume the role of an undercover agent fighting through a city using a mix of shooting and platforming. As you progress, you’ll begin to find artifacts of the pre-apocalypse that shine a light on what happened in the Splatoon universe. Read our review.

"What's at stake in high-profile Supreme Court case on tariffs: ANALYSIS At stake is whether the modern presidency continues an expansion of power. By any measure, the arguments before the Supreme Court on Wednesday have the makings of a legal blockbuster. The justices will weigh whether the Trump administration acted lawfully when it unilaterally imposed sweeping global tariffs -- actions with economic consequences measured in the trillions of dollars. Beneath the trade numbers lies a constitutional clash over who holds the power to tax, regulate and declare emergencies. The outcome could redefine how far a president can stretch a congressional delegation of authority before the separation of powers gives way to executive rule. Presidential encroachment on congressional turf? Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to ""lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises."" Tariffs traditionally fall within that legislative domain, and any bill raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives. In 1977, after years of concern during the Vietnam era about unchecked executive action, Congress enacted the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). It also allows the president, upon declaring a national emergency, to regulate certain international economic transactions that threaten national security. But the statute never mentions duties or taxes. Critics, including small business owners entangled in global supply chains, argue that President Trump’s sweeping, indefinite tariffs on imports exceed the powers Congress granted under IEEPA. Conservative, free-market scholars such as Ilya Somin have called the move ""the largest unilateral trade action since the Great Depression"" and ""a usurpation of legislative power."" They warn that allowing a president to impose what are effectively taxes without congressional approval would flip the constitutional design on its head. The Trump administration sees it differently. It has argued that persistent trade imbalances and supply-chain vulnerabilities amount to an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" to national security. From that premise, it claims IEEPA gives the president the authority to ""regulate importation and exportation"" when foreign economic behavior undermines U.S. interests. Tariffs, the argument goes, are not primarily fiscal measures to raise money, but regulatory tools to change other nations’ conduct, and so part of a long-recognized arsenal of executive power. The major questions doctrine, with a foreign-policy twist The case before the Supreme Court represents an inflection point for a newly defined doctrine developed by the court’s conservative majority. The major questions doctrine (MQD) holds that neither agencies nor presidents can make decisions of ""vast economic and political significance"" without a clear authorization from Congress. The court has already used this doctrine to strike down major Democratic initiatives. In West Virginia v. EPA (2022), the court blocked Obama-era carbon regulations, holding that Congress must speak clearly before authorizing an agency to reshape an entire industry. One year later, in Biden v. Nebraska, it used the same justification to strike down student loan forgiveness, finding that a general power to ""waive or modify"" loans did not justify erasing hundreds of billions of dollars in debt. The Federal Circuit applied that same reasoning to Trump’s tariffs. It described the global trade restrictions -- covering nearly all imports, with no time limit -- as both ""unheralded"" and ""transformative."" Because IEEPA’s text contains no clear reference to tariffs or taxation, the court concluded that the president’s action failed the MQD test. But the administration counters that the MQD has never before been applied to presidential actions regarding foreign affairs. Extending the doctrine to national security and international commerce, the administration argues, would hamstring the chief executive’s ability to act swiftly in crises that Congress cannot predict or legislate in real time. Is a tariff a tax, or just regulation by another name? At the center of the tariffs case is a deceptively simple IEEPA statutory phrase: the power ""to regulate . . . importation."" Lower courts emphasized that ""the power to regulate is not the power to tax."" Reading it otherwise, they said, would transfer one of Congress’ most fundamental powers to the president. The Trump administration contends that the phrase is a ""capacious concept that has historically encompassed tariffs."" In short, the administration wants the Supreme Court to treat tariffs not as taxes, but as one tool among many for managing economic threats. Some critics respond that such an interpretation would erase any meaningful limit on presidential emergency powers – voices that include the conservative Goldwater Institute, the libertarian think-tank Cato Institute, and the left-leaning Brennan Center. If tariffs qualify for such a definition, they warn, then almost any trade restriction could be justified as ""regulating importation, effectively giving presidents a standing license to reshape global commerce on their own, without any congressional oversight or checks. The courts: Limits below, deference above The Trump administration’s aggressive assertions of executive power are meeting resistance in the lower federal courts, with judges finding in some cases that the administration exceeded constitutional or statutory bounds and procedural norms. Most recently, a federal judge in Rhode Island temporarily ordered the Trump administration to continue funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) amid the federal government shutdown, following a lawsuit by several states. Yet in many cases, the Supreme Court majority has shown a willingness to defer to broad claims of executive authority, particularly when national security or foreign affairs are invoked. In April, for example, the high court ruled 5-4 that the Trump administration could resume deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, but said detainees must be given due process to challenge their removal. The net result of such rulings is not merely an affirming of presidential discretion, but a dramatic expansion of presidential power. Defining an 'emergency' IEEPA allows presidential action only in response to an ""unusual and extraordinary threat."" Whether long-standing trade deficits qualify under that definition is a central question before the Supreme Court. The administration argues that modern economies and globalized supply chains have turned trade imbalances into genuine security risks. Opponents counter that chronic economic conditions, however serious, are hardly ""unusual."" Redefining ordinary challenges as emergencies, they say, would render the statutory limitation meaningless. A constitutional inflection point The tariffs litigation is about far more than trillions of dollars. It also tests the boundaries of executive power.

"Almost everything is on hiatus. The EU AI Act, Digital Services Act, and Digital Markets Act are all at risk. The European Commission is preparing to end the year with virtually no movement on its most important tech policy initiatives. Many measures may even be reversed. In particular, a series of changes threatens to weaken the entire framework of the EU AI Act by eroding its substance. There could also be major reconsiderations of the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. Not to mention the Digital Networks Act and the EU Space Act, before they even see the light of day, are already the subject of legal disputes. Since the tariff agreement between the United States and Europe was signed last August, big tech companies, backed by the Trump administration, have increased pressure to soften restrictions on all fronts. Possible AI Act Delay Europe's landmark artificial intelligence law went into effect in August 2024, but the deadline for full implementation is set for August 2027, with an important intermediate milestone in 2026. According to the Financial Times, the first review of possible amendments could take place toward the end of 2026 as part of a broader Digital Omnibus package, which aims to simplify guidelines. At a daily press briefing on November 7, Thomas Regnier, the spokesman for the European Commission for Digital Sovereignty, acknowledged mounting concerns. “A lot is happening in the field of artificial intelligence. Standards are lagging. There are concerns from industry and member states,"" he said. “In this context, we have a ‘digital omnibus’ coming, and that would be the appropriate framework to address some of these concerns. But no decision has been made yet.” The most significant change would involve postponing by one year—from August 2026 to August 2027—the application of penalties for violations of the new rules in order to “grant sufficient time for providers and users of AI systems to comply.” The Telecom Industry Frays The Digital Networks Act had been promised by the end of the year, but the EU Commission is stalling. The act won't be discussed again until late January 2026, assuming an agreement can be reached. There are too many differences of opinion among member states, particularly on two issues: shutting down copper networks and strengthening BEREC, the European regulatory authority. On the issue of shutting down copper networks, Germany reportedly said no to the proposed 2030 deadline, which it considered too soon. Regarding the strengthening of BEREC, many national authorities have balked, citing differences in market conditions as their official rationale. In reality, the pushback is likely due to fears of losing influence and power in their respective countries. In short, the single telecom market project is slipping away. The revision of net neutrality rules has disappeared from the version of the Digital Networks Act currently being worked on, while the initiative to rebalance market conditions between telecoms and big tech companies is ill-defined. Space Is Not Limitless The United States has officially spoken out against the EU Space Act, declaring Europe’s proposal unacceptable as it would hinder American companies by restricting their scope of operations. In a 13-page document responding to the public consultation launched in July by the European Commission, the US State Department listed all the sections that would need to be revised for Europe to avoid retaliation for failing to meet the commitments made in the framework agreement on tariffs. “The current draft of the EU Space Act contradicts the spirit of the agreement,” the State Department wrote flatly, calling on Europe to “allow for smoother cooperation with the U.S. government and industry rather than introduce additional barriers to cooperation.” American Tech Giants Resist DSA and DMA The European Commission continues to send letters to American tech giants calling on them to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA). But with a barrage of appeals from the parties involved, timelines are becoming extremely drawn out. Apple and Google have sharply criticized the DMA in recent weeks, underscoring how strained the negotiations with Europe are becoming. Last August, the Federal Trade Commission warned that certain DSA rules might conflict with American laws, particularly regarding freedom of expression and the security of United States citizens. Breaking Up the Band The US State Department reportedly lobbied on behalf of the Wi-Fi industry, which includes major American companies like Apple, Broadcom, Cisco, and Qualcomm, to protect a specific band of the mobile spectrum. According to the MLex news outlet, the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG), which assists the European Commission in developing radio spectrum policy, has proposed a compromise on the use of the upper 6-GHz band in favor of the mobile phone industry. The US State Department reportedly urged member states to reserve nearly half of the band for Wi-Fi services, specifically for high-speed, low-latency applications such as virtual reality and cloud gaming. According to MLex, 13 out of 27 countries sided with the mobile operators, while the others abstained. In any case, EU countries can change the policy, since the RSPG only issues recommendations, not binding decisions. For a final decision, the ball is in the European Commission's court.

"Wednesday will be a big day for the public finances, with the key November tax returns due to be published. All eyes will be on the corporate tax haul, with Davy estimating that the take in this month alone could be close to €10 billion. This compares to about €7.75 billion last year when the once-off boost from the receipt of money from the Apple tax judgment is excluded. The brokers note that the June corporate tax returns were strong, and that this is the traditional indicator for companies which have a December year-end and pay most of their tax in November. Profit trends in the few big players that pay tax here remain strong. READ MORE The healthy receipts are likely to guarantee another budget surplus this year, despite significant overspending, which is likely to come close to €4 billion above budget. The Department of Finance expects further corporate tax growth next year, as the benefit of the 15 per cent rate imposed on the biggest companies starts to kick in. If Irish households are so rich, why does it feel like an illusion? The tax inflow will increase pressure on finance Ministers Jack Chambers and Simon Harris to ease up on spending control next year if departments again run in advance of budget. Their pledges not to do so will be tested. It will also increase demands from the Opposition for more help for households, at each and every turn. It is all a long way from the fears back in April when US president Donald Trump first announced his tariff plan, that the best days of corporate tax might be behind us. But the renewed inflow of tax, mainly from US companies, could again rouse the White House to renew its focus on the Republic and the companies that operate here. The old story about the State’s vulnerability on the tax front remains, with revenues increasingly reliant on a few very big companies. Of interest in this context will also be the key VAT and income tax returns in November. If somewhat slower growth in the Irish economy starts to show up here, our reliance on corporation tax is set to grow yet further.",left
Breaking down Supreme Court arguments over Trump's sweeping tariffs Some Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical about President Trump's power to impose sweeping tariffs. The court weighed whether Mr. Trump could implement his tariff plan under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CBS News' Jan Crawford has more.,left
"Stocks posted their first weekly losses in three weeks on Friday as concerns about the sky-high valuations of artificial intelligence companies prompted investors to pull back. The Nasdaq Composite, which closely tracks the biggest technology companies, recorded a drop of 3% this week, its worst since the global market sell-off in April fueled by the rollout of President Donald Trump’s ""Liberation Day"" tariff policies. The S&P 500 posted a loss of 1.6% this week. The broad-based index broke its streak of three weeks of gains. Stocks sharply retreated from the lows of the day after Senate Democrats offered a new plan to end the government shutdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P finished slightly positive for the day, while the Nasdaq closed down. For the year, the Nasdaq and S&P are still holding on to substantial double-digit gains. Markets have been led lower primarily by companies connected to the artificial intelligence boom. Collectively, the drop this week in shares of Microsoft, Nvidia, AMD, Palantir, Oracle and Instagram owner Meta Platforms has erased more than $820 billion of market value. Nvidia declined 7%, while Oracle, which provides cloud computing services for AI software developers, dropped 8.8%, as did chipmaker AMD. Meta and Microsoft tumbled around 4% this week. Super Micro Computer, which sells servers and equipment that cloud computing providers use for AI, plunged 23% this week and was the worst performing stock in the S&P 500 for the five-day frame. The S&P 500 technology sector as a whole is by far the worst performing sector this week, shedding 4.2%. Not all tech stocks have fared so poorly though. Apple, the second largest company in the world behind Nvidia, and Alphabet each ended the week down just 0.7%, while Amazon posted a fractional gain. The sell-off started Tuesday, after government contractor and AI developer Palantir reported earnings. Fears that it was too highly valued led to the stock plunging in the following days and dragging its peers lower. Two top Wall Street CEOs also warned that a market pullback could be on the horizon. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang further fueled fears about the U.S. tech sector, telling the Financial Times on Thursday that China would likely “win the AI race.” He later clarified, writing that “China is nanoseconds behind America in AI.” On Friday, reporters asked Trump if he was concerned about an ""AI bubble."" ""No, I love AI,"" Trump said. ""We're leading China, we're leading the world."" Other factors could be driving the market losses, too. On Friday, consumer sentiment tumbled to near record low levels in the widely read University of Michigan’s survey of consumers. “With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,” survey director Joanne Hsu said. The government shutdown has led to a lack of official data points for the market to trade on. The jobs report that was scheduled for release Friday was not published, nor was last month’s report. Other key economic indicators have also not been released due to the 37-day shutdown. That has led investors to rely more heavily on corporate earnings reports and alternative data. One of those alternative datapoints, ADP’s private employment report, said that companies added only 42,000 jobs last month. A report from research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas also showed that announced job cuts from U.S.-based employers reached the highest level for any October in 22 years.",left
"Interest rates are in a good place to deal with persistently elevated inflation, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said Monday in her first public remarks since President Donald Trump said he had fired her. Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, is the first central bank official to ever be subject to a firing attempt. In a letter announcing her removal, Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud, which still haven’t been taken to court. Cook sued Trump shortly afterwards, in what has become a landmark case on presidential power and Fed independence that will be decided next year by the Supreme Court. The court ruled that Cook can remain in her role for now, and has scheduled oral arguments in January. Cook said Monday she is “beyond grateful” for the support she’s received in her legal battle with the Trump administration, but didn’t comment further on the topic. Cook has voted to lower interest rates in the past two Fed meetings, but hadn’t commented publicly on the economy since before Trump said in August that he fired her. Fed officials routinely participate in public events to lay out their views on the economy in the spirit of transparency and helping investors understand the direction of monetary policy. In prepared remarks for an event in Washington, DC, Cook offered a balanced perspective on the US economy, detailing the twin threat to the central bank’s dual mandate of stable prices and full employment. She pointed to signs of strain in the labor market, such as rising Black unemployment, but suggested there’s more urgency to finish the job on inflation than to lower rates further to prevent mass layoffs. “Let me be clear. I am committed to reaching our 2% inflation target,” she said. “I see the current policy rate as remaining modestly restrictive, which is appropriate given that inflation remains somewhat above our 2% target.” The heated Fed debate Cook’s latest comments come at a time when Fed policymakers are divided on how Trump’s economic policies might impact prices, employment and economic growth. There were “strongly differing views” among officials at last week’s rate-setting meeting, when the Fed lowered rates for the second time in a row, Chair Jerome Powell said in a post-meeting news conference. Two Fed officials cast dissenting votes, but for opposing reasons: Fed Governor Stephen Miran voted in favor a larger, half-point cut; while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid preferred to hold borrowing costs steady. That was the first time since 2019 there were dissents calling for both easier and tighter policy. On one side, Fed officials argue that any inflation spurred by Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy will likely prove to be a one-off price increase and that the US labor market is at serious risk of falling off a cliff if the Fed doesn’t continue to lower rates. Most of the officials in this camp are Trump appointees. Powell has characterized the notion of limited tariff inflation as “reasonable.” Cook herself said “the effect of tariffs on prices, in theory, should represent a one-time increase.” The other side of the Fed debate argues that the risk of higher inflation is greater, especially when considering that inflation has remained above the Fed’s 2% target for more than four years. In a Friday statement explaining his dissent, Schmid said he has heard “widespread concern over continued cost increases and inflation” from people in his district. “Rising healthcare costs and insurance premiums are top of mind,” he said. The suspension of government data because of the government shutdown, which is nearing the longest on record, has made the Fed’s job of judging the economy even more difficult. Cook didn’t provide a full-throated call for rate cuts in her latest remarks, but said she is attentive to the risks around the labor market. She also didn’t sound overly concerned with inflation, stating that her “assessment is that inflation is on track to continue on its trend toward our target of 2% once the tariff effects are behind us.” “We are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated,” Cook said. “Every meeting, including December’s, is a live meeting.” At the end of Monday’s event, Cook said she believes public service “is worth the scrutiny.” “I’ve been motivated to do public service, given my family’s history, for example, in the civil rights movement and my participation in it myself,” she said. “And then I had to learn to have a thick skin if I thought the principle was worth pursuing.” “This too shall pass,” Cook added.",left
"This African nation built its development on diamonds. Now it's crashing down Diamonds helped transform Botswana from one of the world’s poorest nations into one of Africa’s success stories GABORONE, Botswana -- In a village outside Botswana ’s capital, Keorapetse Koko sat on an aging couch in her sparsely furnished home, stunned that a career — and an entire nation’s economy — built on diamonds had fallen so far, so fast. For 17 years, she had earned a living cutting and polishing the gems that helped transform Botswana from one of the world’s poorest nations into one of Africa’s success stories. Diamonds were discovered in 1967, a year after independence, an abrupt change of fortune for the landlocked country. Botswana became the world’s top diamond producer by value, and second-largest by volume after Russia. Diamonds are woven into the national identity, with local Olympic champion runner Letsile Tebogo heading a De Beers campaign celebrating how the industry funds schools and stadiums. The stones that Koko and thousands of others dug and polished over the decades have funded Botswana’s health, education, infrastructure and more. The country risked the “resource curse” of building its economy on a single natural asset — and unlike many African nations, it was a success. But Koko lost her job a year ago, joining many others left adrift as Africa’s trade in natural diamonds buckles under growing pressure from cheaper lab-grown diamonds mass-produced mainly in China and India. “I have debts and I don’t know how I am going to pay them,” said the mother of two, who had survived on about $300 a month and relied on her employer for medical insurance. It had been a decent situation for a semi-skilled worker in a country where the average monthly salary is about $500. “Every month they call me asking for money. But where do I get it?” Botswana, which has unearthed some of the world’s biggest stones, has prided itself on prudently managing its natural wealth, avoiding the corruption and fighting that have plagued many African peers. Its marketing message has been simple: Its stones are conflict-free and help fund development. “Diamonds built our country,” said Joseph Tsimako, president of the Botswana Mine Workers Union, which represents about 10,000 workers in the nation of 2.5 million people. “Now, as the world changes, we must find a way to make sure they don’t destroy the lives of the people who helped build it.” He warned that new U.S. tariffs under the Trump administration could worsen Botswana’s downturn, triggering staffing freezes, unpaid leave and more layoffs. The U.S. has imposed a 15% tariff on diamonds that are mined, cut and polished there. Diamond exports, roughly 80% of Botswana’s foreign earnings and a third of government revenue, have tumbled. Debswana, the largest local diamond producer and a joint venture between the government and mining giant De Beers, saw revenues halve last year. It has paused operations at some mines as Botswana and Angola enter talks to take over controlling stakes in De Beers’ diamond mining unit. In September, Botswana’s national statistics agency reported a 43% drop in diamond output in the second quarter, the steepest fall in the country’s modern mining history. The World Bank expects the economy to shrink 3% this year, the second consecutive contraction. The global rise of synthetic diamonds has been swift. They have “given stiff competition, especially in lower-quality stones,” said Siddarth Gothi, chairman of the Botswana Diamond Manufacturers Association. The gems emerged in the 1950s for industrial use. By the 1970s they had reached jewelry quality. Lab-grown stones now sell for up to 80% less than natural diamonds. Once making up just 1% of global sales in 2015, they have surged to nearly 20%. Glitzy social media videos have fueled the appeal of synthetic gems made in weeks under intense heat and pressure and marketed as cheaper, conflict-free and eco-friendly alternatives to stones formed over billions of years. Environmental groups have said natural diamond mining can drive deforestation, destroy habitats, degrade the soil and pollute the water. But environmental claims about the synthetic gems also face scrutiny, with critics noting that production remains energy-intensive, often powered by fossil fuels. From “a marginal phenomenon,” an “unprecedented flood” of synthetics now threatens the natural diamond’s value and future, World Federation of Diamond Bourses president Yoram Dvash warned in July. Lab-grown stones now account for most new U.S. engagement rings, he said. Natural diamond prices have fallen roughly 30% since 2022, leaving the industry at what Dvash called “a critical juncture.” Hollywood stars, including Billie Eilish and Pamela Anderson, and Bollywood celebrities have boosted synthetic diamonds’ allure, along with Gen Z influencers. “The new generation of youngsters getting engaged, they’ve got far more important things to spend their money on than a diamond,” said Ian Furman, founder of Naturally Diamonds, which sells natural and synthetic diamonds in neighboring South Africa. “So, it’s become so attractive to them to buy lab diamonds."" Furman said that for every 100 diamonds his company sells, around 95 are synthetic when just five or six years ago it was overwhelmingly natural diamonds. The shift is felt beyond Botswana. Across southern Africa, falling production of natural diamonds and revenue have led to job cuts and financial strain. To counter the trend, Botswana, Angola, Namibia, South Africa and Congo in June agreed to pool 1% of annual diamond revenues, translating into millions of dollars, into a global marketing push led by the Natural Diamond Council to promote natural stones. The nonprofit’s members include major mining companies such as De Beers Group and Rio Tinto, which have invested heavily in natural diamonds. Last year, the council launched a “Real. Rare. Responsible” campaign starring actor Lily James in a bid to recast natural diamonds as unique and ethically sourced. Kristina Buckley Kayel, the council’s managing director for North America, said restoring natural diamonds’ “desirability” is essential to protect producer economies, particularly in southern Africa. With its diamond income no longer assured, Botswana’s government in September created a sovereign wealth fund focused on investment and diversification beyond mining, although details about its value and investors sketchy. Suddenly, the country’s elephant-heavy tourism industry and other mining options, including gold, silver and uranium, are more important than ever. But for Koko, the laid-off diamond worker, the policy shift may have come too late. “I was the breadwinner in a big family,” she said. “Now I don’t even know how to feed my own. Looking for another job is very difficult. The skills I learned are only relevant to the diamond industry.” She never owned a diamond herself. Even the smallest would be a luxury beyond her means. ___ Mutsaka reported from Harare, Zimbabwe.

"How Trump’s Supreme Court nominees could save his tariffs: ANALYSIS They showed surprising interest in a possible legal justification. President Donald Trump’s unprecedented use of tariffs to exact billions of dollars from American importers during self-declared national emergencies was intensely scrutinized Wednesday by the U.S. Supreme Court. Many of the justices seemed unconvinced that a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) awarded Trump with unfettered ability to tariff any country, at any level, for as long as desired, since the Constitution gives Congress primary power to collect taxes. But the three Trump-nominated justices -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett -- notably stood out during oral arguments for apparent shared interest in legal rationales that could deliver the president a win. Statistically, those three justices have been key votes. After Chief Justice John Roberts, it was Kavanaugh, Barrett, and Gorsuch in the court's last term who were most often in the majority in narrowly-divided cases, according to SCOTUSblog. The Trump justices are ""likely to decide the case,"" said Sarah Isgur, SCOTUSblog editor and an ABC News legal contributor. While much of the debate during oral arguments centered on the meaning of a president’s ability to ""regulate importation"" under the law -- which does not mention tariffs -- Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett zeroed in on a separate phrase that they each suggested could give the president cover. The law says the president may regulate importation ""by means of … licenses or otherwise."" The Trump administration argued licensing -- or, the payment of a fee as a form of permission to import goods -- is ""very, very similar"" to tariffs, which are ""economically equivalent."" ""This license thing is important to me,"" declared Justice Barrett during an exchange with the tariff challengers’ attorney Neal Katyal. Justice Gorsuch, who at one point voiced concern about Trump’s potential violation of separation of powers, later appeared hyperfocused on the plain text of the law. ""The statute says the president may, by means of licenses or otherwise, regulate importation,"" Gorsuch pointed out. ""Maybe the President could simply recharacterize these tariffs as licenses or rejigger the scheme so that they are licenses."" When Katyal pushed back, saying using the word 'license' to let Trump ""tariff the world"" would be a stretch, Gorsuch replied: ""But you're not disputing 'licenses or otherwise' means what it says."" ""Gorsuch seemed to be saying that the plain language of the statute in fact did clearly delegate this authority [to Trump],"" wrote Josh Blackman, a constitutional law scholar and professor at South Texas College of Law, in a blog post. Justice Kavanaugh appeared to take the possible legal justification for Trump’s tariffs a step further. He repeatedly emphasized a unanimous 1976 Supreme Court decision that upheld President Gerald Ford’s authority to impose monetary import adjustments -- or fees -- on oil even though the word ""tariffs"" wasn’t mentioned in the relevant law. ""Attorneys standing where you are stood up and said the license fee now before the Court involves the broadest exercise of the tariff power in the history of the American republic,"" Kavanaugh said to Katyal of the Ford case. ""The court, obviously 9-0, rejects that argument."" Justice Barrett doubled down on Kavanaugh’s point, saying the Ford-era precedent ""rejects the idea that it was impermissible to use the fees, and we can call them license fees, that functioned as tariffs or duties."" That court said ""that Congress could use the exaction of money to control quantity,"" Barrett said, signaling a potential view of Trump’s tariffs as purely regulatory measures as opposed to purposefully revenue-raising ones. The tariffs at issue in the Trump case have collected more than $89 billion so far for the U.S. Treasury, officials said. ""On balance, Justice Barrett did not seem convinced that the government lost under the statute,"" Blackman said. ""I think she is a likely vote for the government here."" Barrett and Kavanaugh also seemed to coalesce around the idea that Trump’s tariff power was a “common sense” interpretation of Congress' emergencies law, which indisputably gives a president authority to cut off trade entirely if necessary. ""Why would a rational Congress say: 'Yeah, we're going to give the president the power to shut down trade ... but can't do a 1% tariff? That doesn't seem to have a lot of common sense behind it,"" Kavanaugh said. ""The court has repeatedly said a tariff on foreign imports is an exercise of the commerce power, not of the taxation power,” Kavanaugh said. Barrett pressed Oregon Solicitor General Benjamin Gutman, representing the states, on the same point: ""Doesn't it seem like it would make sense that Congress would want the President to use something that was less, you know, weaker medicine than completely shutting down trade as leverage to try to get a foreign nation to do something?"" All told, after nearly three hours of arguments, few of the justices seemed interested in deeply probing the practical implications of striking down Trump’s tariffs -- perhaps a sign that few justices considered it a likely outcome. ""It seems to me like it could be a mess,"" observed Barrett succinctly. Many legal experts said, despite early skepticism from the justices towards Trump’s broad assertion of tariff power, the case remains a toss-up, largely because of mixed signals from the president's three appointees ""The fundamentals are still working against the Trump administration,"" said Isgur. ""This is a court that believes in separation of powers and the structural constitution, and the government’s theory of the case is an aggressive expansion of presidential power at the expense of Congress.” The court's three liberal justices -- Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson -- voiced the strongest skepticism of Trump's tariffs. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito signaled views mostly sympathetic to the president. Blackman feels more certain about the outcome, after closely watching Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. ""This case is close, but I think that ultimately the tariffs are upheld,"" he wrote.",left
"Simon Harris’s 10-month term as Minister for Foreign Affairs was dominated by two international challenges: Donald Trump’s tariff diplomacy and the war in Gaza. In both cases, the Government had to tread a delicate path to avoid attracting unwanted attention from Washington. Ireland suffered a gentler blow from tariffs than many feared, not least because of the treatment of the pharmaceutical sector which is a major driver of exports and a significant employer. And as Israel’s assault on Gaza continued, more European Union member-states moved towards Ireland’s position on Palestinian statehood. It will be for incoming Minister Helen McEntee to deal with the diplomatic implications of the Occupied Territories Bill if it becomes law. The legislation has overwhelming support in the Oireachtas and among voters but the draft Bill has faced criticism from some members of Congress and the Government will need to make its case on Capitol Hill to limit any repercussions. Much of the new Minister’s focus in 2026 will be on Ireland’s assumption of the EU presidency in the second half of the year. The rotating presidency is less central to European governance than it was but it will still be an important test of the effectiveness of all Government departments as well as of Irish diplomacy. READ MORE Irish ministers will chair meetings across 10 different areas and Irish officials will chair about 150 working groups of civil servants across all sectors. The most politically sensitive issues are likely to be defence, EU enlargement including Ukraine, and preparations for the next multi-year European budget framework. McEntee’s experience as a former Minister for Justice will be an advantage as she deals with cross-Border issues and the Irish-British relationship. Relations with London have improved since Keir Starmer became prime minister but the Stormont institutions remain fragile as the parties struggle to work together in the Executive. Recent years have seen a dramatic expansion of Ireland’s global diplomatic footprint and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade now has almost 3500 staff working in more than 100 locations around the world. Much of the expansion was part of a Global Ireland Strategy launched in 2018, which was followed by the publication of regional strategies for Asia, the Americas, Africa, the Middle East, France, Germany and the Nordic Region. These strategies expire in 2025 and the Government is planning to develop a new one called Global Ireland 2040, along with regional strategies for the next 15 years. These strategies should be a moment for fresh thinking about Ireland’s position in a changing geopolitical environment, its interests and values and the opportunities presented by the shifting multilateral order.",left
"President Donald Trump this weekend floated directly paying Americans for their health care costs and giving out $2,000 dividends from tariff revenue, ideas that administration officials later said were not formal proposals being sent to the Senate. In one Truth Social post on Saturday, the president wrote, “I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE.” The following day, he again posted that Republicans should give money directly to people’s health savings accounts, which allow people to save pretax money that can be used for certain medical expenses. Referring to his tariff agenda, Trump wrote, “We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place. A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that the president’s recommendation to Senate Republicans on health care was not yet fully worked out. “We don’t have a formal proposal,” Bessent told ABC’s “This Week,” adding, “We’re not proposing it to the Senate right now, no.” Bessent said any such proposal was contingent on ending the government shutdown, which on Monday will stretch into its 41st day. On Sunday night, senators arrived at an agreement that has the potential to end the shutdown. “The president is posting about it, but again, we have got to get the government reopened before we do this. We are not going to negotiate with the Democrats until they reopen the government. It’s very simple,” he said. Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, similarly downplayed the idea on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” Sunday morning. “He’s brainstorming and trying to help the Senate come up with a deal that can get the government open,” Hassett said. “Everybody believes that people should have health care, and so why not take the people who have higher health care premiums and just mail them a check and let them decide,” he added. Hassett said the idea hasn’t been widely discussed within the Senate or the Trump administration. “The president started this idea yesterday. I don’t think that it’s been discussed widely in the Senate yet. It’s the weekend,” Hassett added. The Senate remained in Washington over the weekend, gaveling into rare Saturday and Sunday sessions to continue discussions about how to end the shutdown. Bessent was also asked on ABC about Trump’s proposal to give people a $2,000 tariff “dividend.” He said he hadn’t yet spoken to the president about it, but that it “could come in lots of forms.” “It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president’s agenda: no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans,” he said. “So those are substantial deductions that are being financed in the tax bill.” The idea of sending tariff rebate checks came up earlier this year as well. After Trump in July said he would favor sending tariff rebate checks to Americans, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced a bill that would provide $600 checks to American adults and children using tariff revenue. The Senate has not yet taken up that bill for a vote. Trump’s posts came as Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill remained in a stalemate over the ongoing government shutdown. An NBC News poll released earlier this month found that Americans blame Republicans more for the shutdown than they do Democrats. Democrats swept Tuesday’s elections, winning by larger-than-expected margins in key races in New Jersey and Virginia. Exit polls found that voters in those states generally disapproved of Trump’s job in office so far and were sour on the state of the U.S. economy. Since then, Trump has doubled down on his insistence that the economy is strong. In one of the Truth Social posts on Sunday, the president wrote, “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k’s are Highest EVER.” Still, the posts this weekend seemed to be an acknowledgment that Republicans may need to do more. In a memo Friday, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin called Tuesday’s elections “an unequivocal Blue Sweep” brought about because “Donald Trump and the Republicans are screwing Americans, while Democrats are fighting for them.”",left
"He stood near the lectern at the White House with a bouffant mane, a preposterously loose-hanging wattle and a winter coat fitting fairly snugly. Donald Trump told the gathering of cabinet members and invited guests that Gobble, who had a frankly brazen manner as he eyeballed the 47th president, was – of course – among the “largest ever” turkeys to receive the annual pardon, permitting him to sail through Thanksgiving without ending up as the centrepiece of an American family dinner. Waddle, his erstwhile turkey companion, was, the president said, “missing in action” and didn’t elaborate. The annual Thanksgiving preamble of the presidential turkey pardoning is a ceremony dating back to Abraham Lincoln but became an official feature on the White House calendar only after George Bush set an example that became a tradition in 1989. The 2025 edition was laced with Trump’s taste in dark comedy and the more menacing undertones of an FBI investigation into the six Democratic members of Congress for their part in a video message to the US military. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth posted a letter he signed ordering the navy to review “potentially unlawful conduct” by former navy captain and Arizona senator Mark Kelly for a possible court martial. Hegseth was among those in the Rose Garden watching Trump pass judgment on the lucky, if ungrateful, turkeys. “Gobble and Waddle: when I first saw their pictures, I was gonna call them Chuck [Schumer] and Nancy [Pelosi],” Trump said. “But then I realised I wouldn’t be pardoning them. I would never pardon those two people.” READ MORE Trump used the occasion to sell a message of accomplishment about the first nine months of his administration. The annual splurge on the Thanksgiving dinner has become a contemporary cost-of-living crisis and without namechecking a source, Trump claimed “the cost of a turkey is down 33 per cent from its Biden-era highs. “Eggs are down 86 per cent since March,” he continued, “and gasoline will soon be hovering around $2 per gallon.” It’s a message the Republicans cannot repeat enough because it is not sinking through to the electorate. The inflation problem has flipped: what became a sticking point for the Biden administration is now a nut that Trump’s government cannot crack. A new Politico poll has found that grocery costs are now the number one affordability concern among adults polled, with 45 per cent naming food shopping as “the most challenging” aspect of American life. Housing came in next at 38 per cent, with anxiety over spiralling rents and future ownership acute among the Gen Z cohort. A number of retail outlets, including Walmart, have issued reports claiming that the average cost of Thanksgiving dinner has decreased this year. But the Bureau of Labor Statistics gives the overall rise in food prices at 2.7 per cent for the year to date. Before a receptive crowd and an indifferent Gobble, Trump also took the moment to remind voters of other triumphs, reminding Americans that the southern border has had “zero” illegal crossings for last seven months. He told the audience that Washington, DC, had become the safest city in the country since the introduction of the National Guard and resumed his verbal battle with Illinois governor JB Pritzker with a lacerating screed that fell somewhere between clumsy insult and clunky attempt at humour. “In Memphis crime is down 64 per cent in three weeks. We could do that in Chicago if they would let us. We have a governor who thinks it’s wonderful that only seven people were killed this week. The mayor is incompetent and the governor is a big fat slob. He oughta invite us in; say ‘please make Chicago safe’. We are going to lose a great city if we don’t do it quickly. “So governor Pritzker if you’re listening, let’s get your act together ... we are going to make your place so safe. I had a little bit of a Pritzker joke. I was going to talk about Pritzker in size, but when I talk about Pritzker, I get angry because he’s not letting us do the job. Some speechwriter wrote some joke about his weight. I would never talk about his weight – I don’t talk about people being fat. I refuse to talk about the fact that he’s a fat slob. I’d like to lose a few pounds too, by the way. And I’m not going to lose it on Thanksgiving, I can tell you that. ‘Cos I’m gonna have a turkey but it’s not going to be that one.” It was a crude attack on a political foe and an odd line to take in a country where four in every 10 adults are classified as obese, during a time of a raging obsession with weight-loss medicines. According to US Department of Agriculture stats, some 46 million turkeys are killed each year for Thanksgiving for a feast that marks the beginning of what health professionals term the weight-gain season, ending on New Year’s Day. And despite Trump’s upbeat message, new reports reflect a collective anxiety around this year’s feasting. The Conference Board, tasked with the monthly Consumer Confidence Index, found it fell a full seven points, to 88.7, in November. It’s the lowest rating since April, which Trump opened by unleashing the administration’s reciprocal tariff plan. So that was the mood as Trump approached Gobble to officially confer his pardon. “He looks like a rather violent bird,” Trump said dubiously before formally addressing the turkey. “Gobble, I just want to tell you that you are unconditionally pardoned,” he began, news that the bird greeted by emitting the short, sharp, turkey shriek, technically known as a gobble. The crowd tittered. The president jumped a little and then gave way to a quick, involuntary imitation of the turkey’s gobble. It was a bizarre moment and the closest thing to a note of dissent within the White House all year. It may be a sign of things to come. Some 82 million Americans will be on the move for a Thanksgiving in which the national morale is jittery at best. The Trumps were among them, due to depart a rainy Washington on Tuesday evening for five days of respite in Florida, with no public events scheduled.",left
"President Donald Trump swept into office with a bold plan to remake America’s economy. But the realities of a persistent affordability crisis, low favorability ratings and biting election losses for his Republican party are forcing him to remake his plan on the fly. Although still in the early stages, Trump’s Plan B appears to be a spaghetti-on-the-wall strategy that includes $2,000 tariff rebate checks, 50-year and portable mortgages and lower tariffs on common grocery items. Each tactic comes with significant question marks – and some are so radical economists fear they could squeeze Americans’ finances even more. Trump’s Plan A The original Trump economic plan was based on three bold assumptions: - America could bring in hundreds of billions of dollars – perhaps even trillions – through tariffs that would fill the country’s coffers without causing inflation to rise. - Massive government spending and regulation cuts could potentially save $1 trillion or more each year. It would incentive businesses to grow and invest in the United States, creating a hiring boom. It could also lower bond yields, which would reduce borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and credit cards. - The spending cuts and tariff revenue would pay for a gigantic tax cut that would lower the cost of living for Americans. For the plan to come to fruition, all three parts had to work perfectly. That’s because each part relied on the other. If one leg of the stool was loose, the whole thing would topple over. As it turns out, some parts didn’t work. Boosted by deregulation of AI companies and tax cuts, the stock market has roared higher. But consumer prices haven’t fallen – they’ve continued to rise. Inflation remains relatively low, but it is picking up, in part because of tariffs. High-profile corporate promises to invest in US manufacturing could take years to bear fruit. Meanwhile, the tax cuts and deregulation have failed to persuade American businesses to make the level of investment that the Trump administration had hoped for. Overall hiring in the United States has come to a standstill in recent months. Bond yields have fallen but not enough to make a major difference. Mortgage rates remain above 6%, and the number of subprime borrowers defaulting on their auto loans has doubled over the past four years, according to Fitch Ratings. It may be early to judge Trump’s economic plan less than a year into his second term, but Americans are increasingly fed up. A recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS showed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 61% say Trump’s policies are making the economy worse. A Democratic sweep of this month’s elections showed a significant leftward shift in former Trump voters and proved affordability was front and center in voters’ minds when they went the polls. Trump’s Plan B Now, a new plan is emerging. Tariff dividends: Trump last weekend floated the idea of $2,000 tariff rebate checks, a proposal he’s mused about before but which seemed to initially catch his advisers off guard this time. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, doubled and tripled down on the proposal this week, saying a plan was actively being considered. Using tariff revenue to issue a kind of stimulus check would need congressional approval, and that may be a tough sell when inflation is on the rise again. Economists warn that sending households thousands of dollars could trigger a rush of demand for goods without adding supply to the market. That imbalance could raise prices even more, exacerbating inflation. 50-year mortgages: Trump this week acknowledged that his administration is considering a 50-year mortgage, which could lower homebuyers’ monthly premiums by drastically extending the length of their home loans. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte called the proposal “a complete game changer.” But critics argue that a 50-year mortgage will ensure many borrowers never actually own their homes. Money that some borrowers could have saved for retirement would end up paid to banks in the form of higher interest payments. The length of the loan also means the total interest ultimately paid on a loan would jump. All of that could harm Americans’ long-term financial security. Portable mortgages: Pulte this week said the Trump administration was considering a portable mortgage, which would allow borrowers to maintain their existing, lower-rate home loans when they purchase a new home. That could potentially thaw the frozen US housing market by giving homeowners the assurance that they could keep their relatively low mortgage payments when they move – even as current mortgage rates remain high. But industry experts worry that the logistics of a portable mortgage plan could be difficult to overcome. The plan would require borrowers to cover the cost difference between the new home and the old one, which could mean a second mortgage. And it could throw a wrench in the gears of the investment market that keeps the mortgage market flowing, unintentionally raising mortgage rates along the way. Lowering some tariffs: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week said that the administration will announce lower tariffs on produce that isn’t grown in the United States, including bananas and coffee. “That will bring the prices down very quickly,” Bessent said. That could reduce import prices, but it probably won’t have a dramatic effect on consumer prices. So far, businesses have chosen to pay roughly 80% of the tariffs’ cost, according to a recent JPMorgan analysis. And the produce Bessent mentioned may be particularly bad examples: Coffee prices were surging because of climate change, long before tariffs kicked in, and Americans’ fixation on coffee ensures that companies can keep their prices high. Bananas are particularly low-priced fruit that won’t dramatically relieve grocery price pressures. Make America Affordable Again A significant amount of political capital remains at stake: Trump won reelection on the economy, criticizing former President Joe Biden for failing to address the rising cost of living after the post-pandemic inflation crisis. Trump’s promise to cut prices on Day One was always unrealistic, but his signature economic policy, tariffs, has proven unpopular, as Americans associate the tariffs with higher costs. Instead, the administration’s policies may be exacerbating the so-called K-shaped economy, in which wealthier Americans benefit from their growing investments in the stock market while lower-income Americans increasingly live paycheck to paycheck. Trump’s immediate reaction to the GOP’s election losses and new polls was denialism: He claimed, falsely, that prices have, in fact fallen during his administration. But the administration is beginning to shift its focus and acknowledge Americans want the White House to do more to address their high cost of living. Administration officials told CNN’s Alayna Treene that Trump is getting more frequent economic briefings and has been encouraged to spend more time on domestic travel and policies. And Bessent this week coined a new Trump-approved phrase: “Make America Affordable Again.” The devil, as always, will be in the details.",left
"Trump administration will partially fund SNAP, but it could take months Trump had said it would be his ""honor"" to fund the food assistance program. The Trump administration has committed to partially funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program with a $4.65 billion payment -- but using emergency funds to pay for reduced SNAP benefits could take ""a few weeks to up to several months,"" a top USDA official told a federal judge in a sworn court filing Monday. The disclosure comes after a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funds to pay for SNAP amid an ongoing government shutdown by Wednesday. Following the court order on Friday, Trump said it would be his ""honor"" to fund the food assistance program. In addition to the delay, the Trump administration also said it was $4 billion short of the expected $8 billion cost to fund SNAP for the month of November, in part because they are declining to tap an additional bucket of emergency funds held by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs SNAP. ""Defendants have worked diligently to comply with the Court's order on the short timeline provided by the Court and during a government shutdown,"" DOJ lawyers wrote Monday's filing. ""I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible,"" Trump posted on social media late Friday. ""If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding."" The $4.65 billion in funding will pay out 50% of the benefits that are due to SNAP recipients in November, according to a declaration from Patrick Penn, Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services. That payment will completely expend SNAP's contingency funding, according to Penn. ""This means that no funds will remain for new SNAP applicants certified in November, disaster assistance, or as a cushion against the potential catastrophic consequences of shutting down SNAP entirely,"" he said. While the Trump administration could use additional funds from tariff revenue, known as Section 32, Penn said the government declined to do so to save the money for child nutrition programs. ""Amid this no-win quandary and upon further consideration following the Courts' orders, USDA has determined that creating a shortfall in Child Nutrition Program funds to fund one month of SNAP benefits is an unacceptable risk, even considering the procedural difficulties with delivering a partial November SNAP payment, because shifting $4 billion dollars to America's SNAP population merely shifts the problem to millions of America's low income children that receive their meals at school,"" Penn said. Beyond the budget shortfall, Penn warned that distributing the reduced benefits could take weeks or months because of ""procedural difficulties."" ""There are procedural difficulties that States will likely experience which would affect November SNAP benefits reaching households in a timely manner and in the correctly reduced amounts,"" he wrote. ""There are procedural difficulties that States will likely experience which would affect November SNAP benefits reaching households in a timely manner and in the correctly reduced amounts."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, criticized the administration's decision to not tap tariff revenue to fully fund SNAP. ""The courts have ordered the administration to use its contingency fund to partially cover food assistance to families in need this month -- and have made clear it can use its transfer authorities to fully fund SNAP,"" Klobuchar said in a statement. ""It is not enough to do the bare minimum -- the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table.""",left
"Why a 50-year mortgage won't solve all of the woes for young homebuyers - The interest rate on a 50-year mortgage would be higher than it would be on a 30-year mortgage. And you'd be making payments for many, many more years. - Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, says there isn’t much of a difference between a homeowner with a 50-year mortgage and a renter. - Betsey Stevenson, professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, warns that homes can depreciate in value. A 50-year mortgage? A 15-year car loan? Is that the only way the middle class can get a glimpse of the American Dream now? Bury yourself in debt for decades? Not a fan. Social media heated up with mortgage talk after President Donald Trump proposed the idea of a 50-year mortgage on Saturday in a post on Truth Social. One post by Trump shows a picture of President Franklin D. Roosevelt with the headline ""30-year mortgage"" and a picture of President Donald Trump with the headline ""50-year mortgage."" The banner above both photos: ""Great American Presidents."" Roosevelt's administration is credited with creating the 30-year mortgage, but the 30-year mortgage was widely adopted much later. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked Wednesday, Nov. 12, about the 50-year mortgage proposal and responded that the mortgage remains in discussion. “This is a proposal that the president himself has commented on,” said Leavitt. “It’s something that the administration is discussing and seriously looking into.” She also confirmed that the White House and the administration are seriously looking at the possibility of a $2,000 payout to Americans. Trump has said he wants to send every American a stimulus check or a tariff dividend to be paid from the revenue produced from tariffs he ramped up in 2025. The Supreme Court currently is weighing the limits of Trump’s tariff powers. As for the 15-year car loan? More on that later, as some say it's not a real strategy, just a joke. Sure, stretching out mortgage payments an extra 20 years would knock down your monthly payment to the lowest point possible and give some a chance to afford to buy a home that they might not otherwise be able to afford to buy. But at what cost? Over the long haul, you're paying far more in finance charges than if you took out a 15-year or 30-year mortgage. That's cash that's flying into someone else's pocket, not yours. The interest rate on a 50-year mortgage would be higher than it would be on a 30-year mortgage. And you'd be making payments for many, many more years. Make no mistake, you're not building wealth in your home early in the game with a 50-year mortgage. Some products likely would involve interest-only payments for several years, too. The idea is intriguing but clearly not a good deal for everyone. Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, gave one example in a prepared statement. Take a simplified example of a $420,000 loan with 20% down and a 6.3% interest rate. In this example, the monthly payment would be about $236 lower with a 50-year mortgage than on a 30-year loan, according to Yun's numbers. The reality, he notes, is that borrowers likely would face a higher interest rate on a 50-year mortgage than a 30-year loan, which would raise monthly payments somewhat. The small savings, he said, come with significant trade-offs. Seeing your equity build ever so slowly would make trading up to buy a bigger home or down to a smaller one very difficult, he said. And it would take almost 40 years to pay off half the balance, he said, meaning most borrowers would not begin building meaningful equity until the final decade of the mortgage. The strategy could work for some, he said, including a homeowner who could refinance or be willing to sell the home once it appreciates in value. Historically, he noted, home prices appreciate. Even with little principal accumulation from mortgage payments, Yun said, a homeowner can still participate in home price gains in a given market and the associated housing equity buildup. ""Longer loan terms do not address the true cause of today’s affordability challenges, which is the limited supply of homes in the low- and middle-price ranges,"" Yun said. I remember a time when a 40-year mortgage — and a 50-year adjustable rate mortgage — built some buzz back around 2006 and 2007 for people who were struggling to buy a home. It didn't work out well if you had to sell when home prices collapsed. The 40-year mortgage has a history going back to the early 1980s, according to an earlier report in the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, when 18% fixed-interest rates were squeezing consumers out of buying homes. It never proved to be the most popular product. The risks and the higher long-term costs could outweigh the benefits for many everyday homeowners. Running the numbers on a 50-year mortgage Stephen Kates, a financial analyst for Bankrate.com, also ran some numbers. Lenders, he said, likely would charge a higher interest rate on a 50-year mortgage than a 30-year mortgage to be compensated for taking on a longer and riskier loan. By his calculations, a borrower might see a 50-year mortgage at 7.06% at a time when a 30-year mortgage had an average rate of 6.31%. Using a $320,000 loan as an example, he said, the borrower would pay around $393,800 in total interest over the life of a 30-year mortgage — and a bit more than $844,000 over the life of a 50-year mortgage. What would the savings on the monthly payments be? We're talking about roughly $42 a month. The payment for the 30-year mortgage in this example is $1,982.80. It's $1,940.11 a month on the 50-year mortgage. ""You will slowly acquire equity with each payment, but it is excruciatingly slow with a 50-year mortgage,"" Kates said. In the time it takes you to pay off your 30-year mortgage loan, he said, you would have paid off less than a quarter of the principal with a 50-year mortgage loan product. Aren't you just renting anyway? ""There isn’t much of a difference between a homeowner with a 50-year mortgage and a renter,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics. When you're talking about a 50-year mortgage, Zandi explained, most of the monthly mortgage payment covers the interest owed, particularly during the first 10 years of the loan. ""Since it is difficult to build equity with such a loan, it is more likely that the borrower will default on the loan, and the interest rate is thus higher,"" Zandi said. While it is important to consider different mortgage loan products to help with housing affordability, Zandi said, he does not believe that a 50-year mortgage will help much with that. Some 40-year mortgages are available If you shop around, some lenders are offering 40-year mortgages now. Rocket Mortgage notes online that the Detroit-based giant offers a 40-year mortgage with the first 10 years being interest-only payments. These mortgages can be available for loan amounts between $125,000 to $2 million. Rocket states online that you'd need a down payment of 10% to 40% for a 40-year mortgage, depending on the loan amount and whether you’re using the loan to buy a home or as a cash-out refinance. Lenders need to add other restrictions to manage risk, as well. Rocket notes that borrowers would need six to 12 months of savings in the event of income loss and a qualifying credit score in the range of 660 to 740. The 50-year mortgage already has a bad look Trump's 50-year mortgage plan ended up getting plenty of pushback from liberals and conservatives. According to a report in Politico, White House officials are ""furious with Bill Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, who talked the president into suggesting a 50-year mortgage plan."" Politico reported: ""The White House was blindsided by the idea, according to two people familiar with the situation granted anonymity to discuss internal thinking, and is now dealing with a furious backlash from conservative allies, business leaders and lawmakers."" Homes are unaffordable for many families, though, and it's an issue that needs to be fixed. Home prices rose dramatically in many communities in recent years. Incomes didn't keep pace. And interest rates are high. Some say we're dealing with a crisis when it comes to affordability. Yet, consumers feel stretched in all sorts of areas — health care, groceries, student loan debt, the list can go on and on. High costs in many areas also contribute to financial stress overall. Many say, though, that a 50-year mortgage isn't likely to move the needle much when it comes to affordability. Many communities continue to deal with a lack of affordable homes, and the housing supply remains tight in many areas. Betsey Stevenson, professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, is a well-known voice in economics, thanks to her X social media posts and guest spots that help break things down on MSNBC, NPR and elsewhere. Stevenson raised a prescient warning in her posts Nov. 10 pointing out what should be obvious after the 2007-09 economic crisis, which was marked by a massive housing meltdown. Bottom line: Home prices do not always go up significantly. Much depends on when and where you bought that house, as well as how much you paid for it. ""If you bought in Memphis, Cleveland, Birmingham,"" Stevenson stated, ""50 years ago with a 50-year mortgage, you lost a lot of money."" Stevenson also noted that homes can depreciate in value, particularly if people don't spend money on upkeep. ""Go tour a house an elderly person lived in but spent $0 on maintenance for years. ""Housing is a great forced savings mechanism,"" Stevenson stated on X. ""It's a source of joy. It is a tie to the community. It is not free money."" Would you want a 15-year car loan? As for a 15-year car loan? Well, that idea — while a bad one — appears to have not been pushed by the White House on social media, though some thought it was. Experts warn that the meme for a 15-year car loan was not generated by the White House, as some have suggested. Lead Stories, an online fact-checking site, is running a headline indicating that Trump never went on social media to tout 15-year car loans. According to the story, Trump did not ask the Transportation and Commerce departments to give a green light to 15-year car loans. ""It's a joke,"" according to the headline. A 15-year car loan has to be a joke. The average age of vehicles in the United States was 12.8 years in 2025, according to S&P Global Mobility. The average age for passenger cars was 14.5 years in service, while it was 11.9 years for light trucks. Your car really would be worth very little at the end of a 15-year car loan, and the risk of being underwater on that car loan — where you owe far more than the car is worth at trade-in — would skyrocket with a 15-year car loan. The underlying collateral for a car loan is the vehicle, which is a depreciating asset, Kates said. By contrast, homes often appreciate in value over time. ""I don’t think a 15-year standard auto loan could ever be viable,"" Kates said. He noted that there are some classic car loans for car collectors available for 15 years at an average rate of 9.02%. Jonathan Gregory, senior manager on Cox Automotive’s economic and industry insights team, said about 27% of auto loans now have terms that are longer than 72 months or six years. That's a sign, he said, that lenders are working with buyers to lower monthly payments. ""Lower monthly payments do not address vehicle affordability in the long run,"" Gregory said. ""Longer loans only make vehicle more expensive and add to the longer term issue of negative equity."" Sure, moving away from four-year car loans to six- or seven-year car loans has helped move some metal. But don't bet on a 15-year car loan getting you out of a jam anytime soon. Ditto for a 50-year mortgage. Detroit Free Press Washington correspondent Todd Spangler contributed to this report. Contact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

"Intensifying US threats against Venezuela are raising expectations of imminent military action as President Donald Trump heaps pressure on the Caracas regime and flexes power in the Western Hemisphere. Every public sign and warning by the president raises the risk that the US is on an inexorable path toward a military confrontation that would represent a big political gamble given the public’s antipathy toward new foreign wars. Trump plans to hold a meeting at the White House Monday evening about next steps on Venezuela, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected to attend, as well as White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Controversy is also mounting because of new concerns about the legality of any potential action against Venezuela and warnings that the administration’s lethal strikes against alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean have infringed the laws of war. Congressional committees are pledging vigorous, bipartisan oversight of the attacks — a rare occurrence in Trump’s second term. And in an extraordinary move over the Thanksgiving holiday, Trump appeared to undercut the rationale that he’s fighting regional cartels with the offer of a pardon to a former Honduran president jailed last year in the US for funneling cocaine into the country. Trump fueled expectations of looming warfare in Venezuela by warning on Thanksgiving Day that the US will “very soon” start taking action to stop alleged drug-trafficking networks on land. On Saturday, he declared the impoverished, oil-rich country’s airspace should be considered closed. An armada of US ships is stationed in the Caribbean Sea off Venezuela, led by the world’s mightiest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford. Administration officials have meanwhile spent weeks crafting legal arguments for action against regional drug traffickers that critics warn fall short of legal and constitutional stipulations. Yet, with the US potentially on the edge of a new war, the administration is yet to provide the public with evidence-based and legally detailed rationales for sending American sons and daughters into action. This raises the possibility that the buildup and threats are part of a psychological pressure campaign to force President Nicolás Maduro to step down or to encourage officials or generals to topple him. Or a possible military showdown with Venezuela could simply be a new sign this administration sees few political, moral, legal or constitutional curbs on acting exactly how Trump wants. And even if this is all a bluff to trigger regime change peacefully, officials must soon consider what to do if it fails. Trump’s authority will suffer a huge blow if he draws down US forces with Maduro still in office. Trump on Sunday confirmed for the first time that he’d spoken over the phone to Maduro recently but did not say when or what he discussed. “I don’t want to comment on it; the answer is yes,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “I wouldn’t say it went well or badly. It was a phone call.” A political risk A new US war or concentrated military action abroad would contradict one of the president’s core foreign policy principles — the avoidance of new overseas conflicts. And multiple polls show Americans are opposed to a strike on Venezuela. A CBS News survey last month found 76% didn’t believe that Trump had explained his position there and only 13% saw the country as a major threat to US security. In the past, some US administrations have made strenuous efforts ahead of military engagement to prepare the public for action and to rally support behind the president — as was the case before the invasion of Iraq in 2003. But apart from vague comments about fighting drug cartels — some of which may overstate Venezuela’s place in the narcotics trade — senior officials have offered few explanations to the public. Still, millions of Venezuelans would not miss Maduro if he’s toppled after years of repression that has impoverished a country with huge economic potential and led to the flight of millions of refugees, including to the US. There are some scenarios in which Maduro’s departure might benefit US foreign policy and the region — although administration officials have offered little clarity on whether they’ve planned for the day after any military action. The failure to do so in Iraq and Afghanistan led to foreign policy disasters. Some analysts fear regime change could trigger chaos and bloodshed in a nation as fractured as Venezuela, possibly sending even more refugees into neighboring countries and the US. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, however, defended Trump’s approach. He said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday the president gave Maduro an invitation to leave and that he’s protecting the US from drug traffickers. “He’s made it very clear we’re not going to put troops into Venezuela,” the Oklahoma Republican told Dana Bash, though Trump hasn’t publicly ruled out that possibility. Controversy over the administration’s intentions in the region has been fueled further by what people familiar with the incident described to CNN’s Natasha Bertrand as a follow-up US military attack on a suspected drug vessel on September 2 after an initial attack did not kill everyone aboard. Experts and some lawmakers have expressed concern that the so-called double-tap strike would violate the laws of armed conflict, which prohibit the execution of an enemy combatant who is taken out of the fight due to injury or surrender. Details of the strikes were first reported by The Intercept and The Washington Post. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists all strikes on alleged drugs boats are lawful under US and international law, partly because traffickers have been designated terrorists by the US government. But Trump’s critics argue the president is waging war without acquiring the authorization of Congress as is required by the Constitution and is infringing the victims’ rights to due process. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and fighter jet pilot, said on “State of the Union” that from what he knew about the attack, he would not have carried out the order to conduct a second strike. “If what has been reported is accurate, I have got serious concerns about anybody in that chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over. We are not Russia. We’re not Iraq,” Kelly said. “They have tied themselves in knots trying to explain to us on the Armed Services Committee how this is legal, not sharing all of the information either, which is really troubling. But going after survivors in the water, that is clearly not lawful.” Kelly has been warned by the Pentagon that he could be called back into uniform for court-martial over a video he filmed with other Democratic lawmakers reminding military personnel they were not obligated to carry out illegal orders. The lawmakers have said Trump jeopardized their safety after he accused them of “seditious behavior, punishable by death.” He has since denied he was “threatening death” against the group. The House and Senate armed services committees have pledged to carry out rigorous oversight of the administration’s operations in the Caribbean. A stunning pardon announcement Disquiet about the Trump administration’s motives in Latin America is also being fed by an extraordinary announcement by the president that he plans to pardon former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, only a year into a 45-year federal prison sentence for drug trafficking. Hernández was found guilty of conspiring with cartels as they moved 400 tons of cocaine through Honduras to the US and of protecting and enriching drug traffickers in his inner circle. The president’s pardoning of a leader who operated his country as a narco-state would severely undercut his rationale for using military force against Maduro — whom he accuses of the same offense. “He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in US courts. And less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narco-trafficking,” Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “If he doesn’t care about narco-trafficking … then what is this Venezuela thing really about?” The president insisted to reporters Sunday that the conviction was a “Biden setup” and implied that no one who had served as a president should face justice for transgressions in office. “You take any country you want — if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn’t mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life,” he said. Mullin said on “State of the Union” there was “probably a good-faith” gesture in the president’s pardon offer, and that he trusted his “natural” approach to foreign affairs. The comparison of the due process previously offered by the United States to Hernández, who was convicted by a jury, to the fate of drug traffickers blown out of the Caribbean Sea, without officials apparently knowing their identities, is striking. The timing of Trump’s pardon move suggests an alternative explanation, as it came just before Hondurans voted in a presidential election on Sunday. On Friday, Trump endorsed the populist outsider candidacy of Nasry “Tito” Asfura, who comes from the same conservative National Party as Hernández. His double intervention looks like an attempt to influence the elections, since he threatened in a Truth Social post that the US would not work with any other president but Asfura. This is far from the first time that Trump has tried to use his power and clout to support MAGA-like leaders in the Western Hemisphere. He slapped a 50% tariff on Brazil after it prosecuted his friend and former President Jair Bolsonaro for trying to overthrow an election. He offered a $40 billion bailout to Argentina, conditional on voters supporting the party of another ally, President Javier Milei, in the midterm elections. Trump has also allied himself with President Nayib Bukele, the leader of El Salvador, who accepted into a notorious prison deportees from the Trump administration’s purge, and who bills himself as “the world’s coolest dictator.” He has feuded with Colombia’s leftist leader, President Gustavo Petro. There are legitimate foreign policy reasons why the United States might seek closer relations with Latin American leaders, especially as it aims to curtail influence-building efforts in the region by Russia and China. The question now preoccupying Latin America is whether Trump is willing to use the sword, not just executive power and taxpayer cash, to get the regime he wants in Venezuela.

"Before challenging Trump's Florida governor pick, James Fishback sought Fed role, investments from Trump world The 30-year-old investment firm CEO has puzzled some in the MAGA world. In August, amid President Donald Trump's clash with the Federal Reserve, top Trump advisers began receiving a wave of calls and text messages from an unexpected source insisting he could solve the administration's problem, pressing to be appointed to a seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, one of the most influential economic posts in government. The push was from James Fishback, a 30-year-old investment firm CEO and political newcomer who pitched himself to Trump advisers as a fierce supporter of the president who should replace Adriana Kugler, who had announced she would step down as a Federal Reserve governor, claiming he would serve as Trump's ""bulldog"" on the Federal Reserve Board, sources told ABC News. Fishback privately reached out to James Blair, the White House deputy chief of staff, urging him to consider him for the role while also contacting influential outside Trump advisers, like Alex Bruesewitz, who Fishback asked if he could vouch for him to the president himself. ""I'd be honored if you can put in a good word with the boss for me,"" Fishback texted him, according to Bruesewitz. Amid the push, Fishback even called President Trump directly and pitched himself for the role, sources told ABC News. Fishback was persistent, lobbying for the role daily, the sources said, and circulated a memo outlining why he should be chosen, which touted his loyalty to Trump and his promises to vote for large interest rate cuts, and included a list of his cable-news appearances, according to a memo reviewed by ABC News. ""I would be honored to serve as a bulldog fighter for the President and his movement at the Federal Reserve for 5 months. I would defend his agenda on the Fed Board (which suffers from Trump Derangement Syndrome),"" the memo reads. After a local Florida social media account posted an unattributed claim on X that Fishback was ""being floated"" for the Fed role, speculation sparked online and on cable news networks that he was in fact under serious consideration. But in reality, Fishback was never under consideration for the Fed position, multiple sources tell ABC News, and senior White House officials ultimately concluded that Fishback had created the entire news cycle. President Trump would go on to name Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to the position. 'Who the hell is this guy?' Now, months after his unsuccessful push to have Trump name him to the Fed board, Fishback has announced an insurgent campaign to take down Rep. Byron Donalds, President Trump's endorsed candidate for Florida governor. His announcement on Monday came after spending the last two weeks unloading relentless attacks on Donalds, while even taking shots at President Trump and getting into social media spats with the same Trump advisers he had been lobbying a few short months ago. When asked if being passed over for the fed role played any role in his decision to run, Fishback told ABC News, ""Not at all."" ""I called President Trump in early August and offered to serve out the final months of the remaining term of a newly vacated seat at the Federal Reserve. I was glad to see that he later picked my friend Steve Miran for the role, who I have known for years,"" Fishback told ABC News. ""The D.C. establishment speaking anonymously to the press to try to hurt my campaign before even I've even declared tells you how much they fear my run for Florida governor."" ""The only thing that has to do with this, me getting into this race, is Byron Donalds being an utter America last failure,"" he said. Fishback's announcement is the latest wrench thrown into next year's Republican primary for Florida governor, a race that's already swirling with intrigue. While Trump has endorsed Donalds, sources tell ABC News that Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited and cannot run for reelection, is still searching for a potential heir to back in the primary to continue what he views as his legacy in the state. Rumors have circulated about Lt. Gov. Jay Collins possibly jumping into the race, and earlier this year sources told ABC News that DeSantis' wife, Casey, was seriously considering a 2026 run for Florida governor to succeed her husband. At one point, former congressman-turned-OAN host Matt Gaetz was also weighing a gubernatorial run next year, sources said, but after a damning House Ethics Committee report released earlier this year, speculation around his candidacy has since died down. When asked if he had ruled out running next year, Gaetz wouldn't say, instead telling ABC News, ""Right now I'm having a blast growing 'The Matt Gaetz Show' on One America News!"" Fishback's effort to secure a spot on the Federal Reserve Board was just one in a growing list of episodes that sources said have puzzled some in the MAGA world since his profile has risen over the course of the year. ""A lot of people are just asking themselves, who the hell is this guy?"" one Trump adviser told ABC News. ""Clearly, Byron Donalds and his D.C. establishment backers see me as a threat,"" Fishback told ABC News. ""They should. Floridians are sick and tired of the inside baseball. They want a governor who will preserve Ron DeSantis' legacy and make it easier to get a great paying job, buy a home, raise a family, and retire with dignity."" ""Voters want and deserve a leader who will fight for Florida -- not sell us out to multinational corporations that want to develop every inch of our state, build AI data centers that threaten our water supply and raise our electric bills, and replace American workers with H-1B servants,"" Fishback said. Fishback's lobbying for a Fed Board seat was not the first time he had privately sought support from Trump world. Weeks earlier this year, he began reaching out to figures in Trump's orbit, looking for investments in his newly launched Azoria exchange-traded fund. Alex Bruesewitz, a senior adviser to Never Surrender PAC and influential MAGA figure who is backing Donalds' run for governor, told ABC News that Fishback approached him earlier this year and the two met for coffee in West Palm Beach, where Fishback boasted of numerous political and financial ventures he claimed were underway. Soon after, Fishback sent documents for Bruesewitz to wire $25,000 into the Azoria fund and promising substantial returns. In an email from late July obtained by ABC News, Fishback thanked Bruesewitz for agreeing to make the investment. ""He was talking about how he's going to make me so much money in return,"" Bruesewitz told ABC News, adding that the documents included lofty projections and plans for additional funds, and highlighted Fishback's social media reach. Bruesewitz said that before wiring the money, he became uneasy over the proposal, having only recently met Fishback, and showed the materials to a friend who manages several publicly traded funds. The friend warned that the proposal appeared dubious, Bruesewitz said. In response, Fishback told ABC News that Bruesewitz has every reason to fabricate smears about him and push them to the media given that he is supporting the Trump-backed candidate in Florida's gubernatorial primary. Bruesewitz ultimately declined to invest in Azoria. In October, Trustees moved to liquidate and terminate Azoria's ETFs, the Azoria 500 Meritocracy ETF (SPXM.Z), and the Azoria Tesla Convexity ETF (TSLV.Z), which the board said came after ""considering all relevant information, including without limitation recent litigation involving a principal of"" Azoria. Fishback called the move another example of ""de-banking of conservatives,"" arguing that it came after he vowed to ""stop investing in companies that use the H-1B program to fire Americans."" 'DOGE adviser?' Fishback had a breakthrough moment on the conservative media scene earlier this year, riding the wave of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, when he began appearing on CNN, Fox News, and Newsmax, often described as a ""DOGE adviser,"" weighing in on work being done by the team. His platform grew even more when in a post on X in February, he pitched Musk the idea of DOGE dividend checks that would pay Americans money based on government savings. After the idea caught fire online, Musk said he would bring the concept to Trump -- who later endorsed the idea and has since floated a similar concept around sending Americans $2,000 ""tariff dividend"" checks. The success of Fishback's viral ""DOGE dividend"" idea led to more media appearances by Fishback, raising his profile further. In an interview with conservative news outlet Breitbart in July, Fishback was asked, ""Tell us about your time at DOGE. What was it like, and when did you leave?"" Fishback replied, ""I started working on the DOGE movement at the beginning with Vivek (Ramaswamy, an initial DOGE co-lead), and I left at the end of May or early June when Elon had this big fallout with the president that he lost, and it is because Elon did not deliver in the way I thought he would have."" However, even though he made appearances across cable news as a ""DOGE adviser"" and claimed he was one on social media, multiple senior officials who worked for DOGE, both before its official establishment in January and after, told ABC News that Fishback never held any official or informal role advising Musk or the DOGE team, and that he was inflating his connection to the group. ""The idea he had anything to do with DOGE is laughable,"" a former senior DOGE official told ABC News. Fishback disputed claims that he misrepresented his connections to Musk and DOGE to boost his profile. He acknowledged he was never a paid DOGE employee, arguing that his involvement came from drafting the so-called ""DOGE dividend,"" the proposal he independently pitched to Musk over X, and dismissed DOGE officials' accusations that he overstated his role as a dispute over ""semantics."" In July, a former senior DOGE adviser and spokesperson for Elon Musk responded to a post from Fishback on X where he said he ""advised DOGE."" ""You didn't advise DOGE,"" Katie Miller wrote. Fishback responded to Miller's post by writing to Musk, ""Stop making your employees lie for you."" Fishback has faced allegations of misrepresenting his credentials before. A lawsuit filed earlier this year by his former employer, Greenlight Capital and DME Capital Management, alleged that he misrepresented his position at the company in order to gain credibility for his own fund, Azoria Partners, by falsely claiming he was the company's ""Head of Macro."" ""Fishback falsely represented himself to industry contacts and at industry events as Greenlight's 'Head of Macro' and the person running macro investing at Greenlight and responsible for the performance of its macro investment portfolio. None of these things were true,"" the lawsuit alleges. Fishback's former employer claims he repeatedly told industry contacts, conference audiences, podcast hosts, and social media followers that he held the ""Head of Macro"" role. However, the company says that Fishback was hired as a research analyst and was never given any such role because, as the lawsuit states, ""the title 'Head of Macro' has never existed at Greenlight."" ""Fishback apparently thought this would provide him and Azoria with more credibility and help attract investors at Greenlight's expense,"" the lawsuit claims. In September, Fishback admitted to sharing unauthorized, confidential company information with individuals outside the firm, according to a joint court filing from the company and Fishback. Fishback agreed to return and permanently delete any confidential information that remained in his possession, the court filing said. The court filing omitted some of the firm's allegations, including alleged misstatements about Fishback's position at the firm, which Fishback maintains ""were introduced and then eliminated from Greenlight's lawsuit."" ""The only claim of Greenlight's that advanced was a vanilla 'breach of contract' claim,"" Fishback told ABC News in a statement, and pointed ABC News to an email from May 2023 that was part of the litigation where the Greenlight Chief Operating Office said in an email, referring to Fishback, ""He's our head of macro."" Greenlight did not respond to a request for comment. In an SEC filing, Tidal said it moved to shut down the Azoria 500 Meritocracy ETF and the Azoria TSLA Convexity ETF after reviewing relevant information, including litigation tied to ""recent litigation involving a principal of"" Azoria. Fishback disputes that the liquidation is justified and has alleged political motivations. 'He would appear and irritate us all' Fishback's rise in the conservative media sphere this year appears to date back to being introduced to Ramaswamy by billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, according to a podcast episode Fishback appeared on with Ramaswamy in 2023. While Ramaswamy took a liking to Fishback early on, Fishback's behavior during the early days of Ramaswamy's 2024 presidential campaign quickly puzzled some staffers and raised some early red flags as he began showing up to campaign events around the country unannounced and uninvited, according to multiple former campaign staff. In one instance, Fishback, who never held a paid position on the campaign, showed up to campaign events in Florida, including a fundraiser at The Breakers in Palm Beach, when the campaign was still operating on a shoestring budget. According to former campaign aides, at the end of the Palm Beach event, Fishback flagged down staff to ask if he could stay the night in a hotel room booked by the campaign, which confused staff given he had not been invited or included in any event or budget planning. The campaign declined to pay for his stay, sources told ABC News, and staff who were unsure where Fishback was ending up sleeping and later joked that maybe he slept on the beach. But the request set off early concerns about how much time Fishback was spending around Ramaswamy, staffers said. ""I can just tell you full stop two things: I've never slept on any beach, and I've never stayed a night at The Breakers,"" Fishback told ABC News, dismissing the concerns as ""jealous staffers"" who ""didn't like that I was on the plane or at Vivek's house."" Ramaswamy was initially impressed by Fishback as a young conservative entrepreneur whose rhetorical and political style in some ways mirrored his own, sources said, and he introduced Fishbeck to conservative political power players and donated to the high school debate league Fishback founded, Incubate Debate. But sources said that as the campaign went on, staffers grew increasingly frustrated by Fishbeck's persistent efforts to figure out ways to be close to Ramaswamy, including asking staff if he could ride on his private jet as it crisscrossed the country. ""I liken him to a rash. He would appear and irritate us all, and then he would go away,"" one former senior campaign staffer said. ""And that's James Fishback."" When Ramaswamy's presidential bid ended, sources said, Ramaswamy himself had grown tired of Fishback. ""At first he thought he was fantastic,"" one former aide said. ""By the end, he did not."" The relationship deteriorated further, sources said, when Fishback publicly criticized Ramaswamy in December 2024 amid backlash over his comments supporting H-1B visas, which allow companies to hire foreign workers who are skilled in specialty occupations. Ramaswamy did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News. At the end of October, speculation began to rumble about Fishback potentially jumping into the Florida governor's race after he shifted to criticizing Donalds for the first time across his social media accounts. His first post targeting Donalds appeared on Oct. 31, when he shared a 2012 video of Donalds supporting the H-1B visa program, which Donalds has since said he was against. Fishback wrote that he hoped Donalds had ""changed his mind,"" and has since posted relentlessly on X, attacking Donalds over the issue. He has labeled Donalds, who is Black, ""DEI Donalds,"" which several voices on the right have criticized as racist. Fishback has pushed back on the charge, and has since appeared to claim that ""DEI"" meant ""Didn't Earn It."" Just weeks earlier, Fishback's X account had a different tone toward Donalds, sharing posts from an event the pair had recently done together -- some of which have since been deleted. According to Fishback, he soured on Donalds and began considering a run against him after having dinner with him and his wife at the Capitol Grill in Naples, Florida, which he said the Donalds paid for. Fishback didn't mention his plans during the dinner, but Fishback said he left thinking, ""Someone else had to step into this race."" ""Everything changed for me on Aug. 18. I had dinner with Byron Donalds and his wife,"" Fishback said. ""You're not going to find anything positive about me and Byron Donalds after Aug. 18."" But nearly a week after the dinner, Fishback appeared alongside Donalds at a fireside chat in his hometown of Madison County, Florida, where he told the crowd he was honored to speak alongside Donalds and that he was ""proud to call Byron Donalds a friend."" ""It's not personal,"" Fishback told ABC News. ""It is simply that I don't believe that he would be a great governor.""",left
"Forget the Grinch — this year, it’s tariffs that could try to steal the Christmas tree. Artificial Christmas trees will cost an estimated 10% to 20% more this season than they did last year because of increased tariff costs, according to several major U.S. importers. And the cost of lights could jump as much as 63% for the same reason. Mass market Christmas decor has not been manufactured in the United States for decades. If vendors were to try to make it domestically, the mere cost of moving the manufacturing operations would be prohibitive — let alone actually producing the trees. Mac Harman, the founder and CEO of artificial tree vendor Balsam Hill, estimates that if he were to manufacture Christmas trees in the U.S., the price of an $800 tree would skyrocket to around $3,000. “When we make Christmas trees, some of the equipment is the size of a U.S. football field,” he told NBC News in an interview. ""There’s a ton of capital that’s invested in these factories, and the equipment’s so big you can’t even pick it up and put it on a container [ship] and transport it,"" he said. Moreover, the most popular artificial option, prelit trees, are a very labor intensive project, Harman said. The lights are often strung by hand, a job that American factories have neither the manpower nor the budgets to undertake. “There are over 20,000 people in China that manufacture Christmas trees. Many of those people are the ones that are experts in stringing the lights, and they’ve done it for a long time. They’re very fast at it. They’re good at it,” he said. Harman described how the U.S. export Christmas decor business first took off in Thailand in the 1990s, before moving to China over time. Now, he estimates, around 90% of mass market Christmas decor products are made in China. But that could be changing. Following Trump's election last November, Harman tried to diversify Balsam Hill’s supply chain because he anticipated the president would follow through with China tariffs after he had spent months campaigning on them. As a result of those diversification efforts, Harman said, during this Christmas season, around a third of Balsam Hill's trees will come from outside of China. Balsam Hill also tried to blunt tariff-related price pressures this year by importing the bulk of its inventory ahead of Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement in April. But the administration's constant back-and-forth since then on China tariff rates — from a low of 30% at one point all the way up to 145% — proved too unpredictable for Harman to effectively execute the pricing plan he had initially wanted to. “Unfortunately, most of these trees [this year] have come into the industry at 20% or 30% tariffs. So those costs do add up,” he said. The overall supply of artificial trees will also take a hit this year, he said, after vendors opted to import fewer trees to offset the higher tariff costs. Harman said he expects the industry to stock 15% fewer artificial trees this season, potentially leading to fewer options for those who tree shop later in the season. Balsam Hill is not alone in paring back its Christmas decor imports during this year of outsized tariff impacts. Costco CEO Ron Vachris said on the company’s September quarterly earnings call that the big-box discounter had “really thinned down that whole category"" of discretionary Christmas items such as toys and decor this year. Yet, in spite of the broader tariff pressures and stubbornly low consumer sentiment, the National Retail Federation forecasts that U.S. holiday spending will surpass $1 trillion this year for the first time. According to a recent National Retail Federation survey, the average consumer plans to spend around $270 on non-gift holiday items like decor and cards this season. One place that tariffs don't seem poised to bite American consumers this Christmas is in the live tree category. The vast majority of live trees that are sold stateside are grown in the U.S. But even those grown in Canada will be tariff-free this year under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal. This comes even as the Trump administration enacts a 45% duty on Canadian lumber entering the U.S. According to the Real Christmas Tree Board, a live tree industry group, 84% of the wholesale Christmas tree growers it surveyed recently said they do not plan to increase prices this year. “We’re one of those few products where we can say, 'Hey, we don’t have to worry about that,'” Marsha Gray, the board’s executive director, told NBC News. And given that live Christmas trees take about 10 years to grow to market size, current economic factors like tariffs are not poised to impact supply in the next few years. “We’re at a point right now where we just have a really, really strong inventory, the strongest inventory I’ve seen in over a decade,” Gray said. No matter what type of Christmas tree people choose, the National Retail Federation says that while consumers may be slightly more cautious this year about shopping, they’re also more prepared. “Somehow, every year, Santa Claus always comes, and I think that really captures the way the holiday season goes,” federation President and CEO Matthew Shay wrote in the group's holiday forecast. “People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it.”",left
"What we covered here • A flurry of economic data released Tuesday after a blackout during the government shutdown paints a confusing picture of the US economy. • September wholesale inflation rose by 0.3%, keeping the annual level at 2.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. • Retail sales rose 0.2% in September, but after factoring in the 0.3% increase in prices that month, spending was actually down 0.1%. • Consumer confidence for November fell to its lowest level since April as Americans expressed concern about what the future holds for their jobs, cost of living and the economy at large. Our live coverage has ended. For more analysis about the US economy, read here. Dow rises by 550 points as latest data signals more chance of another rate cut Wall Street continued to waver Tuesday after a slew of economic data was released following the end of the government shutdown. The Dow rose by around 550 points, or 1.19%, in the early afternoon session. The S&P 500 rose by 0.72% and the Nasdaq pushed higher by 0.41%. On balance, traders focused on any sign that the latest economic news would boost the chances of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve when policymakers meet in a couple of weeks. Some Fed officials have in recent days telegraphed their intention to trim rates at the next meeting, invigorating markets. Traders are currently pricing in a chance of more than 80% that the central bank will ease off. But the tech sector still continued to struggle Tuesday, with AI darling Nvidia falling by around 3% on news that Meta was mulling purchasing chips from Alphabet. September retail sales and PPI data landed several weeks late. October and November remain ""TBD"" Data for September retail sales and wholesale inflation landed Tuesday, several weeks delayed by the recent US government shutdown. But just when – or even if – the following months’ retail sales and Producer Price Index reports will be released remains TBD. The federal statistical agencies are working their way through an unprecedented economic data backlog after the lengthy lapse in appropriations stymied efforts to collect, analyze and release reports for a month and a half. As it stands now, several crucial economic reports for the month of October – notably the jobs report and the Consumer Price Index – won’t be published in their original form. Instead, partial data will be released alongside the November reports. As of Tuesday midday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics had yet to provide an update as to whether and how the October PPI will be released as well as a rescheduled date for the November report. The Census Bureau still has a “TBD” pasted by the October release date for retail sales. After stripping out costly energy and food costs, underlying wholesale inflation eased in September When economists and policymakers analyze inflation data, they often look to “core” indexes that strip out the categories of food and energy, which tend to be more volatile. In the September Producer Price Index, that underlying trend looked fairly tame: Core PPI rose just 0.1% for the month, which brought the annual rate to 2.6%, the lowest since July 2024. This is better than the 0.3% monthly gain and 2.7% annual rate economists were expecting for core, according to FactSet consensus estimates. PPI doesn’t translate directly to the inflation consumers see; however, sharp-rising goods prices – specifically in the areas of gasoline, food and electricity – could be foretelling that those key household purchases could get even pricier than they already are. Consumer confidence falls to lowest in seven months as concerns grow about the economy America’s economic mood is souring as worries about the labor market mount. The Conference Board’s latest survey of American consumers, released Tuesday, showed that consumer confidence declined sharply this month to a reading of 88.7, the lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs. “Consumers’ write-in responses pertaining to factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics, with increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,” Dana Peterson, the Conference Board’s chief economist, said in a release. The government shutdown ended earlier this month, so consumer confidence could rebound in December. The survey also showed growing pessimism among respondents about job availability and income prospects in the next six months. “Mid-2026 expectations for labor market conditions remained decidedly negative, and expectations for increased household incomes shrunk dramatically, after six months of strongly positive readings,” Peterson said. There have been high-profile announcements of layoffs in recent weeks, but that doesn’t immediately translate into higher unemployment, which was at a low 4.4% rate in September, according to the latest Labor Department data. The latest inflation data shows some businesses are absorbing tariff costs Tuesday’s PPI data indicated that some firms are shielding their customers from the brunt of the steep and blunt tariffs on imported goods, wrote Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He noted the trade services category, which tends to be quite volatile, measures profit margins for wholesalers and retailers. So, economists have been watching that category closely as a potential indication for how much businesses might be absorbing some of the tariff costs versus passing them along to consumers. Trade services in September dipped 0.2%, following a 1.7% drop in August, PPI data showed. “But the picture differs markedly by sector, with auto retailers accepting substantially lower margins, while most other retailers are passing on all the rise in acquisition prices to consumers,” Tombs wrote. For consumers, September PPI could mean better news if they’re in the market for sneakers or sports equipment, less so if they’re wanting to buy a new computer or TV. In addition to auto dealers, the industries showing some of the biggest hits to their margins (and potentially lower cost increases for the end consumer) included retailers of sporting goods, clothing, shoes and jewelry as well as wholesalers of machinery, paper and plastics, PPI data shows. Industries with the largest increases in margins (indicating higher costs are potentially being passed on to consumers) were retailers of TVs, video equipment, computers, furniture and flooring – categories where the US is heavily reliant on imports. Pending home sales rose in October to highest level in nearly a year US home sales based on contract signings rose in October to the highest level in nearly a year, in a sign that lower mortgage rates are spurring home-buying activity. Pending home sales rose 1.9% in October from the prior month, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday, bringing the index to its highest level since November 2024. Sales were up across the country except in the West, with the Midwest seeing a robust 5.3% monthly increase. “The Midwest shined above other regions due to better affordability, while contract signings retreated in the more expensive West region,” Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, said in a release. “Days on the market typically lengthen from November through February, providing better negotiating power to buyers during the holiday season.” It typically takes about a month or two for a home sale to close after an offer was accepted. Mortgage rates have been steadily declining since May, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reaching this year’s lowest point in late October. Mortgage rates have increased slightly since. US home-price growth slowed in September to its weakest pace since 2023 US home prices increased in September at the weakest pace since mid-2023 as affordability challenges in major markets across the country kept buyers on the sidelines. The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index rose 1.3% in September, S&P Global said Tuesday, slightly down from August’s 1.4% gain. The index has been steadily weakening since 2022, when the Federal Reserve began to hike interest rates to tamp down inflation. The central bank is now lowering borrowing costs, with its benchmark lending rate at its lowest point in three years. “National home prices continued trailing inflation, with September’s (Consumer Price Index) running 1.7 percentage points ahead of housing appreciation,” Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables & commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a release. “This marks the widest gap between inflation and home-price growth since the two measures diverged in June, with the spread continuing to widen each month.” Chicago, New York and Boston saw the strongest price gains in September, while home prices in Tampa, Phoenix, Dallas and Miami declined that month. “Markets that were pandemic darlings — particularly in Florida, Arizona, and Texas — are now experiencing outright price declines,” Godec said. “Meanwhile, traditionally stable metros in the Northeast and Midwest continue to post solid gains, suggesting a reversion to pre-pandemic patterns where job markets and urban fundamentals drive appreciation rather than migration trends and remote-work dynamics.” US stocks are mixed after latest economic data Wall Street started the day on a fairly quiet note as investors digested a batch of long-delayed economic data. Within minutes of the opening bell the Dow was already up by close to 270 points, or 0.5%. The broader S&P 500 hovered in and out of the red. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3%. Stocks are coming off two days of strong gains as hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts have boosted markets. However, the S&P 500 and Dow are still on track for their first losing month since April. The Nasdaq is set for its first losing month since March. Investors were keen to see how aspects of the economy – like retail sales – fared in recent months. Investors have embraced hopes for Fed rate cuts after recent comments from central bank officials suggested a cut could be on the table. Treasury yields ticker lower Tuesday morning as investors leaned in to bets that the Fed will cut rates in December. Gold futures rose 1.3%. Gold prices can rise when the Fed is expected to lower rates. It's pricier goods, not services, driving wholesale inflation higher Wholesale goods prices leapt 0.9% in September – the sharpest monthly increase for the category in more than 18 months – and were the driver behind the overall September gain in the Producer Price Index, the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed Tuesday. Wholesale services prices were flat for the month. Energy prices, particularly sharp-rising gas prices, accounted for about two-thirds of that goods index monthly increase. Within goods, categories such as meats, residential electric power and motor vehicles also moved higher. When taking energy out of the equation, as well as food, the underlying goods inflation trend perhaps shows a silver lining: “Core goods price gains slowed to 0.2% after a couple of larger pops, suggesting tariff pressure might be ebbing,” Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO, wrote Tuesday in a note to investors. See PPI's trajectory over the past few years The delayed data for September’s Producer Price Index showed that core inflation is “moving away from the Fed’s 2% target rate,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, in a note Tuesday. “There is not no inflation and it is higher than the 2.1% year-on-year rate for core factory goods when the president took office in January,” he wrote. Headline inflation mostly remained close to expectations. Does the latest economic data change the calculus for the Fed? The federal government on Tuesday released key economic reports on inflation and spending, but the numbers likely did little to sway the heated debate among Federal Reserve policymakers. Central bankers are split on whether they should lower interest rates again at their upcoming meeting in December. They’ve lowered rates twice this year, in September and October, each time by a quarter point, bringing their key interest rate to its lowest level in three years. One side — mostly members of the Fed’s Board of Governors — argues that the Fed should continue lowering rates to preserve the labor market’s health, while the other camp believes that officials should hold rates steady and get the job done on inflation, considering that it has remained above their 2% target for more than four years. The latest data didn’t offer any clear indication that the economy urgently needs any relief from the Fed — nor that price pressures are getting out of control. The numbers, delayed by the government shutdown, are also dated. Retail spending in September was on the weaker side, but it remained in positive territory. And inflation at the wholesale level that month came in mostly as economists had expected. Retail sales rose in September for fourth-straight month Sales at US retailers increased in September for the fourth consecutive month, boosted by low unemployment and a buoyant stock market. Retail sales, which account for about a third of overall spending, rose 0.2% in September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That was a much slower pace than August’s 0.6% gain. But after factoring in the 0.3% increase in prices that month, according to the Consumer Price Index for September, retail spending edged down 0.1%. Spending was up across half of categories in September, increasing the most at so-called miscellaneous retailers by a solid 2.9%. Sales also increased at restaurants and bars, rising 0.7%. Meanwhile, sales were down at car dealerships, clothing stores, electronics retailers, department stores and online. The report was originally due on October 16, but it was delayed because of the government shutdown. The figures show that consumer spending, the lifeblood of the US economy, was somewhat weak heading into the current quarter, which stretches from October through December. In September, employers added jobs at a robust pace and unemployment ticked up but remained low. Scott Bessent: ""This isn't sport; this is people's lives"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in a biting rebuke of the Federal Reserve, said members of the central bank should quit commenting publicly about the potential direction of rate-setting policy and focus instead on listening to Americans who are struggling with high borrowing rates. “It’s time for the Fed to move back into the background like it used to, calm things down, work for the American people, [and] set monetary policy on a good course,” Bessent said in an interview with CNBC Tuesday morning. “This isn’t sport; it’s people’s lives. We just need to calm down all these speeches by these bank presidents that are redundant.” Markets have moved – sometimes dramatically – in recent days after Fed governors and regional bank presidents commented on potential monetary policy decisions. But Bessent said he believes the Fed should lower rates in December, arguing that the government shutdown hurt the economy. “We know the economy hasn’t gotten better,” he said. “I’m not even sure what the discussion is here.” US wholesale inflation heated up in September US wholesale inflation picked up speed in September, an indication that prices could soon heat up even more for consumers. The shutdown-delayed Producer Price Index for September showed that prices increased 0.3% on a monthly basis, keeping the annual inflation rate at 2.7%. In August, wholesale prices fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, largely because of compressed profit margins. August’s annual increase, which was initially estimated at 2.6%, was upwardly revised to 2.7%. Economists were expecting that producer prices rose 0.3% from August and was 2.6% for the 12 months ended in September. Why consumer spending seems stronger this year Black Friday through Christmas will test America’s economic strength. Preliminary reports look good: Early-bird holiday shoppers have been out in strong numbers this year, according to a report earlier this month from Bank of America. High-income consumers keep spending like they’ve never heard of this affordability crisis people keep talking about. Middle- and lower-income folks, despite declaring that they’re fed up with their financial situations, are also still spending, in aggregate. But Americans are all spending more in part because prices are higher. Stubborn inflation, combined with already-high prices, has forced people to shell out more for the holidays, pushing spending numbers up. It’s one reason a poll published by Fox News this week showed 76% of Americans have a negative view of this economy, up from 67% in July. Read more here. An unusual trend in the economy is worrying the Fed Something in the US economy isn’t adding up, and it’s rattling the people charged with wrangling inflation and keeping the labor market intact. US companies have sharply slowed their hiring this year, hesitant to invest without knowing the full effects of President Donald Trump’s sweeping economic policies. The economy lost jobs in June and August, and the average pace of job gains for the three months ending in September was only around 62,000, according to the Labor Department. Yet workers’ productivity, a key driver of economic output, remains high. And gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy, has stayed robust. That dichotomy of an expanding economy and a softening labor market presents a conundrum for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, complicating their efforts to determine whether the economy needs cooling or boosting. A growing economy, boosted by resilient consumers and massive investments in AI, should be spurring hiring, especially now that the Fed has started lowering borrowing costs. But that hasn’t happened — and there are fears it won’t. Read more here. Gas prices are now higher under Trump than under Biden President Donald Trump and his economic team often respond to concerns about the affordability crisis by touting how much cheaper gasoline is than under his predecessor. For the vast majority of 2025, this was a legitimate bragging point for the White House. Until now. For the first time since the start of Trump’s second term, the discount between this year’s prices and last year’s has effectively disappeared. The national average for regular gas stood at $3.055 on Tuesday, almost exactly the same as $3.056 a year ago under former President Joe Biden, according to AAA. In fact, Tuesday breaks an eight-day streak where the national average was up on a year-over-year basis, according to AAA data shared with CNN. It’s a big shift from earlier this year, when gas was 30, 40 and even 50 cents cheaper than the same point in 2024. Read more here. Stock futures dip lower ahead of key economic data US stock futures were lower Tuesday morning as investors awaited a slew of economic data. Dow futures fell 34 points, or 0.07%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.04%. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.11%. Stocks are coming off two days in the green. The tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 2.69% on Monday, posting its best day since May. Wall Street is trying to discern whether the Federal Reserve will lower its benchmark interest rate at its policy meeting in December. Traders on Tuesday morning were pricing in an 81% chance that the Fed cuts rates, according to CME FedWatch. New York Fed President John Williams and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly in recent days have suggested they could support a rate cut in December, which helped send stocks higher on Friday and Monday. Stock investors like lower interest rates because it encourages spending and business activity, boosting corporate profits, while lowering bond yields, making stocks relatively more appealing. “During this holiday-shortened week, investors will receive a cornucopia of data now that the government is open again,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a note. “Some of the data will be a bit stale. But they should indicate how [the third quarter] ended for the economy.” CNN’s Fear and Greed Index hovered in “extreme fear.” What to expect from today's inflation numbers Next up in the pipeline of shutdown-delayed economic reports is the September iteration of the Producer Price Index. This closely watched report provides a gauge on inflation at the wholesale level: It lays out the average change in the selling prices that producers receive for their goods and services. While PPI doesn’t directly translate to the Consumer Price Index, it’s viewed as a potential bellwether for the prices consumers may see in the months ahead. That’s where things get interesting with this seemingly old-news report: The trajectory of the pricing trends in Tuesday’s report could provide a window into the price increases consumers are seeing currently and into the near future. That could be especially salient considering the October CPI has been drastically marred as the shutdown hampered data-collection efforts. Economists expect that producer prices likely rose 0.3% in September, which would be an acceleration from the preliminary 0.1% drop reported for August, a decline that was driven by compressed profit margins. The annual rate is expected to hold at 2.6%.",left
"Why are stocks falling and what should investors do? Experts explain Stocks tumbled on Monday, extending a dayslong slide. Stocks tumbled on Monday, extending a dayslong slide that presents a dilemma: Should investors buy in at bargain prices or unload in fear of worse to come? The tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 3% last week, the index’s largest weekly decline since the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. The S&P 500 fell 1.6% over that period, ending three consecutive weeks of gains. The trading marks a rare bout of turbulence on this year’s glide path to higher returns. Even after the losses, the S&P 500 remains up 15% in 2025. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 11%, and the Nasdaq has soared 19%. Two major culprits are to blame for the downturn, analysts said: Growing skepticism about the artificial-intelligence technology at the heart of the market rally, as well as a realization the Federal Reserve may keep interest rates higher for longer than many investors had previously expected. Still, the analysts added, the decline is more likely to be a blip than a sustained downturn, even as they acknowledged uncertainty about the path forward for the U.S. economy. “The market is taking a more sober look,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at trading firm Interactive Brokers, told ABC News, noting Wall Street had breezed past previous hiccups on the way to further returns. “Maybe the glass isn’t always completely half-full.” The recent market decline has coincided with fears about tech giants dependent on AI, which make up a disproportionately large share of the S&P 500. As big-tech names spend hundreds of billions to build data centers necessary to run the energy-intensive technology, the financial benefits remain uncertain. Market gains this year have been concentrated in a handful of tech giants, known as the magnificent seven: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia. Worries over artificial intelligence have thrown cold water on the stocks in recent days, causing their prices to waver, some analysts said. “There’s a recognition that if they spend all this money on data centers, it will weigh on their earnings. And it’s not clear at this point how profitable those investments will be,” Ed Yardeni, the president of market advisory firm Yardeni Research and former chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank's U.S. equities division, told ABC News. Investors are also reckoning with the decreasing probability of an interest rate cut at the Fed’s meeting next month. Traders peg the chances of a quarter-point rate cut next month about 41%, well below where the odds stood two weeks ago, according to CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment. The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate at a meeting last month, and policymakers projected an additional quarter-point cut in December. But stubborn inflation has prompted some Fed officials to voice caution about the further interest rate cuts. Prices rose 3% in September compared to a year ago, putting inflation a percentage point higher than the Fed’s target rate. The prospect of an interest-rate cut typically boosts the stock market, since the promise of cheaper borrowing means a potential boon for firms and their investors. But the opposite also holds true, analysts said: As hope of a rate cut fades, stocks may turn lower. “With increased uncertainty comes increased volatility – and that’s exactly what we’ve seen so far in November,” Bret Kenwell, an investing analyst at eToro, told ABC News, citing the interest rate expectations as well as a potential Supreme Court ruling that could do away with a large swathe of Trump’s tariff policy. Despite acknowledging the recent strain, analysts signaled confidence about the path forward. Ivan Feinseth, a market analyst at Tigress Financial, said the S&P 500 would finish the calendar year with an uptick from its current level of about 6,700 to 7,000. Feinseth attributed his optimism to expectations of continued adoption of AI as well as resilient economic performance. While hiring has slowed in recent months, the U.S. economy has continued to add jobs and sustain steady economic growth. “Sometimes the market gets ahead of itself and everybody kind of panics,” Feinseth said. “But I still think the market’s momentum is to the upside.”",left
"A federal judge in Rhode Island said Thursday that the Trump administration must fully cover food stamp benefits for tens of millions of Americans in November. “People have gone without for too long,” US District Judge John McConnell said during a hastily called hearing Thursday. “Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable.” Nearly 42 million Americans receive food stamps. Payments are made on a staggered basis over the course of a month. But the US Department of Agriculture took the unprecedented step of halting benefits for November, saying the program had run out of funding amid the government shutdown. Despite the judge’s ruling, however, many beneficiaries may have to wait at least a few more days to see the assistance, depending on where they live. States send food stamp enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards, often days or weeks before the new month begins. Those steps need to take place before benefits can restart. McConnell’s order comes days after the administration, in response to an earlier order from him, said it would provide only partial food stamp benefits for November by using $4.65 billion in a contingency fund maintained by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. The judge said the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure money reached the program’s millions of recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided earlier this week that it would not provide the full benefits this month. Under McConnell’s new ruling, the government must tap into billions of additional dollars held by USDA in a separate pot of money so full SNAP benefits can be paid. The judge said those payments needed to be made to states, which administer the program, by Friday. The administration quickly appealed McConnell’s new order, as well as his ruling from last week that required the administration to at least partially fund food stamp benefits for November, to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. The Boston-based appeals court is stacked with appointees of Democratic presidents. Throughout the brief hearing, McConnell repeatedly chastised an attorney representing the Trump administration over the government’s failure to ensure SNAP benefits quickly reached the millions of Americans who rely on them, stressing the on-ground-impact nearly a week after recipients began missing payments for November. “Without SNAP funding for the month of November, 16 million children are immediately at risk of going hungry,” the judge said. “This should never happen in America. In fact, it’s likely that SNAP recipients are hungry as we sit here.” On Tuesday, a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses that brought the legal challenge complained that the administration was not complying with McConnell’s order from last week. The plaintiffs claimed that since the government admitted in court filings that reduced benefits could take weeks or months to be administered, they were violating his directive that the government work “expeditiously” to ensure November payments are made. The judge agreed. “It is clear to the court that the administration did not comply,” he said. “The court was clear that the administration had to either make the full payment by this past Monday, or it must ‘expeditiously resolve the administrative and clerical burdens it described in its papers.’ … The record is clear that the administration did neither.” The hearing was the latest high-stakes court showdown over food stamps, which the administration had attempted to defund amid the government shutdown, prompting both the lawsuit in Rhode Island and a separate one filed by Democratic governors and state attorneys general in Massachusetts. In both cases, McConnell and US District Judge Indira Talwani, of the federal court in Boston, made clear last week that the USDA must tap into contingency funds to provide at least partial SNAP benefits this month, but they left it up to government to decide whether to use unused tariff funds meant for child nutrition programs to provide full SNAP benefits for November. Both judges were appointed by former President Barack Obama. The administration said earlier this week that it opposed using the nearly $17 billion left in the child nutrition fund because it would endanger the nation’s free and reduced-price school meals program, which serves about 29 million children a day. (The agency has transferred $750 million in tariff revenue to the WIC food assistance program for pregnant women, new moms and young children.) But McConnell ruled on Thursday that the administration’s choice not to make full payments by dipping into the other pot of money at the USDA did not reflect reasoned agency decision-making. He pointed specifically to the USDA’s decision to pull money from that pot to the fund the WIC food assistance program, saying that move “undermines” their argument against using it for SNAP payments. “A rationale premised on such legal errors must be set aside as arbitrary and capricious,” McConnell said. The administration pushed back strongly on claims that it wasn’t complying with McConnell’s earlier order and that it had made a slap-dash decision to only partially fund food stamps this month. It insisted in court papers filed Wednesday that since it had released the money from its contingency fund to states and provided guidance on how state officials can calculate reduced payments, “there is nothing more USDA could do.” “We resolved all of the burdens that the government is responsible for,” Tyler Becker, a Justice Department lawyer, said during Thursday’s hearing. Attorneys for the plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case said the new ruling from McConnell was a “major victory” for the millions of Americans who receive the federal food benefits. “This immoral and unlawful decision by the administration has shamefully delayed SNAP payments, taking food off the table of hungry families,” said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward. “We shouldn’t have to force the President to care for his citizens, but we will do whatever is necessary to protect people and communities.” Recalculating partial benefits The swiftly changing legal landscape has left states scrambling to catch up and recipients wondering when they would receive any assistance. The USDA provided states with guidance on Tuesday on how to issue benefits based on cutting households’ maximum allotments in half, which the agency initially said was all it could provide with the available contingency funds. To provide partial benefits, which has never been done before, states have to reprogram their systems to recalculate recipients’ payments. Illinois said that beneficiaries would start seeing payments on Friday, while North Carolina and Massachusetts said recipients could expect to get their assistance next week. But Pennsylvania wrote the agency a letter saying that it would take a few weeks to get aid to recipients because of the burdensome process the USDA chose. Other states CNN contacted could not give a timeline for when benefits would be distributed. By midweek, however, the situation has changed twice in less than 24 hours. On Wednesday evening, the USDA announced it could actually pay 65% of maximum benefits from the contingency fund and issued new guidance to states, which would necessitate another round of recalculations. The next day, McConnell ordered full payments to be made for the month. This story has been updated with additional developments.",left
"Stocks close higher after Trump tariffs encounter skeptical Supreme Court The Supreme Court heard oral arguments about Trump's tariffs on Wednesday. Stocks closed higher on Wednesday after some conservative justices on the Supreme Court voiced skepticism about the lawfulness of President Donald Trump's steepest tariffs, raising the possibility the policies could be struck down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 225 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 jumped 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq increased 0.6%. Trump has ratcheted up tariffs in recent months, in part due to powers invoked under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the legal authority at issue before the Supreme Court. The major stock indexes fell dramatically after Trump unveiled far-reaching tariffs in April, but markets recovered to new highs over the ensuing days and weeks after Trump eased the policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed about 11% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has jumped 16%. Still, the levies have coincided with an uptick of inflation and a slowdown in hiring, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as ""stagflation."" Trump is the first president to try use the IEEPA to set tariffs without Congress, and the justices pushed Solicitor General John Sauer to justify the sweeping authority. Sauer argued the tariffs are ""regulatory"" in nature, and that any revenue raised is incidental. That, despite Trump often boasting about the billions of dollars he says the administration has raked in as a result of the levies. Sauer then faced a barrage of questions from the justices, including several conservatives, who appeared skeptical of Trump’s tariff authority under IEEPA. As part of the case, the nation’s highest court will weigh in on the lawfulness of levies on dozens of countries unveiled in a Rose Garden ceremony that Trump dubbed ""Liberation Day."" The case also concerns tariffs imposed on China, Mexico and Canada, as well as a baseline 10% levy slapped on nearly all imports. If the Supreme Court allows Trump’s steepest tariffs to stand, price increases may accelerate while economic uncertainty associated with the tariffs could put downward pressure on hiring, some economists previously told ABC News. But some economists said the Supreme Court case would have little effect on inflation or interest rates due to the sheer size and inertia of the U.S. economy, as well as the Trump administration’s plans to impose tariffs under other legal authorities. Trump would still retain the power to levy sector-specific tariffs and impose a 15% tariff for up to 150 days under the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to address trade disparities with other countries. Tariffs stand at an overall average effective rate of 17.9%, the highest since 1934, the Yale Budget Lab reported last week. Price levels are expected to climb incrementally this year as a result of the levies, representing a loss of about $1,800 for the average household, the group said. ABC News' Devin Dwyer and Peter Charalambous contributed to this report.",left
"Democrats are torn on what the party's senators got out of the shutdown deal. A Latvian company attempts to solve Europe's Russian drone problem. And, the S&P 500 index is on track to broadly underperform compared to foreign markets this year. Here's what to know today. What Democrats say they won in the Senate shutdown deal Democratic allies and progressive activists were torn after eight Democrats struck a Senate deal with Republicans to end the longest U.S. government shutdown ever. Some characterized the deal as what is wrong with the party: The eight senators caved to the Republicans while not taking advantage of the leverage built off the public's frustration over the shutdown. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. But there are others who see silver linings in the deal, even if the Democrats didn't get everything they wanted from it. By striking a deal to end the six-week standoff, the two sides' agreement includes a ""minibus"" of three appropriations bills, which will fund some parts of the government through next fall. The rest of the government will be funded through Jan. 30. The deal includes funding of the food assistance program known as SNAP for the rest of the fiscal year through September 2026, meaning food stamps can't be used as leverage in any funding fight in the coming months. They also got the Trump administration to agree to reinstate federal workers who were laid off during the shutdown through reductions in force. And they secured language barring future mass firings for the duration of the resolution that keeps the government open through January. The deal fell far short when it comes to health care. Democrats failed to win an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits that are set to expire on Dec. 31. Instead, they secured only a promise from Senate Majority Leader John Thune that the Senate will vote on a bill to extend the health subsidies by the end of the second week of December. The House has made no such promise. Senate Republicans said they're open to extending a pot of Affordable Care Act funds — but only if Democrats acquiesce to stricter abortion restrictions on insurance plans. The demand presents a significant hurdle to reaching a bipartisan deal as Democrats are adamant that existing abortion guardrails under Obamacare are sufficient. Drawing out the high-stakes shutdown through October and into the November ACA open enrollment period served two purposes for Democrats, members on both sides of the deal said. It gave them time to educate the public about an issue few in the country were talking about — the expiring subsidies — and came as Americans began receiving notices of skyrocketing monthly premiums for 2026.

Trump says he has an 'obligation' to sue BBC President Donald Trump has said he has an obligation to proceed with his threatened $1 billion lawsuit against the BBC for editing a speech he made before his supporters’ violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the presidential election result. The BBC’s top executive, Director-General Tim Davie, and its news CEO, Deborah Turness, resigned Sunday after an internal report, leaked to the Daily Telegraph, highlighted this and other alleged editorial misjudgments. Asked whether he would sue, Trump told Fox News Tuesday night: “Well, I guess I have to you know, why not? Because they defrauded the public, and they’ve admitted it.” “I think I have an obligation to do it, because you can’t get people, you can’t allow people to do that,” he said, before comparing the action to his lawsuit against CBS for a “60 Minutes” interview with his then-presidential election rival Kamala Harris. CBS paid $16 million to settle the case. Trump also told Fox News he took offense at this coming from “one of our great allies,” meaning the United Kingdom. The BBC is funded by a national license fee of 174.50 pound ($228) per household, but it is editorially independent and frequently runs critical and revealing news stories about the government of the day. The incident has provided potent fuel for conservative critics of the BBC, including many lawmakers and right-wing newspapers who oppose the license fee and accuse the corporation of being culturally liberal and institutionally biased.

Staff Pick: U.S. vs the world In a year when the stock market has repeatedly hit record highs and the administration has so often touted it as a sign of success, it could seem like it's been an impressive year for investments. But we took a deeper dive into the data. Our analysis found that the S&P 500 is lagging behind the world broadly by more than 10%. We went even further and broke out stock indexes from more than 60 countries around the world to compare them to the U.S. and we found that the S&P falls way down, in 41st place. As the year nears its end, it would likely take a large jump to close the gap significantly. So while America is most likely still a highly desirable place for all kinds of investors, from the average person putting money into a 401(k) to a professional trader, the lagging performance this year is more than your typical year. – Steve Kopack, senior business reporter NBC Select: Online Shopping, Simplified The NBC Select team rounded up the 100 best travel accessories for smoother trips and broke down a top deal on the De'Longhi Magnifica Evo espresso machine.

"Costco sues Trump administration over tariffs, seeks refund of fees Wholesale retail giant Costco has sued the federal government to ensure it will receive a “complete refund” on import duties if the Supreme Court rules against President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York on Nov. 28 and reviewed by USA TODAY, asked the court to find Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs as unlawful. Costco, the largest warehouse club operator in the United States, said it has been the “importer of record” for products affected by the tariffs, but did not provide a specific dollar amount it is seeking in damages. The corporation noted in the filing that the suit was necessary because importers are not guaranteed to receive a refund if the high court strikes down the tariffs, unless they sue. Costco also claims in the lawsuit that Customs and Border Protection denied its request to delay the calculation of the total tariffs that it owes. The lawsuit claims that Costco’s ability to receive a refund will be significantly impacted if those calculations are completed. The suit is separate from the larger case challenging Trump’s tariffs that the Supreme Court heard on Nov. 5. Other companies have sued to preserve refund rights, but the Issaquah, Washington-based retail warehouse club operator is among the largest to sue the administration so far. Others that have sought to protect tariff refunds include Bumble Bee Foods, eyeglass giant EssilorLuxottica, Kawasaki Motors, Revlon, and Yokohama Tire, court records show. CBP deferred to an earlier White House statement on tariffs in an email sent to USA TODAY on Dec. 2. Costco did not respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment on Dec. 1. ‘Razor-close case’ During nearly three hours of debate on Nov. 5, Supreme Court justices questioned whether Trump has the power to impose sweeping tariffs on most imports using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Several legal experts said the justices’ questions reveal a lot about where they stand on Trump’s policy. Ashley Akers, a former Justice Department attorney now with the law firm Holland & Knight, previously told USA TODAY that she heard a “notable skepticism from justices across the ideological spectrum.” “Overall, it felt like a strong day for the tariff challengers, though it feels like this will be a razor-close case,” Akers said. Several justices were concerned that if they sided with Trump, Congress would lose control over tariffs, even though the Constitution gives that power to lawmakers, said Curtis A. Bradley, an expert on foreign relations law at the University of Chicago Law School. Oliver Dunford, an attorney with the libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation, said the case is complicated enough without a majority of the court focusing on just one legal argument. “If I had to guess,” Dunford said, “I’d guess that the court will rule against the president without agreeing on the reason.” The Supreme Court took the tariff case on an accelerated basis, but has not said when it will rule.

"For only the third time in 10 years, one of America’s most broadly representative stock indexes, the S&P 500, is poised to give up its longtime spot as the world’s top performing stock index. But drill down deeper, and the scale of the S&P’s underperformance becomes even starker. Ranked against dozens of other countries’ indexes, the S&P’s annual performance so far is not even among the world’s top 20. Or the top 30, or 40. With annual returns of 16% through Monday, the S&P lands in 41st place among more than 60 stock indexes around the globe, according to an NBC News analysis. This number requires a few caveats, however. The companies in the S&P have created more value so far this year than listings on any other country’s index — more than $7.7 trillion in market value. That exceeds the annual economic output of every country on Earth, except the U.S. and China. Likewise, more than 5,400 companies choose to list their shares on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, according to the World Federation of Exchanges. This combined total gives the U.S. clear standing as the No. 1 destination for publicly traded companies outside of China. Still, the S&P’s relative performance this year is remarkably out of line with historical norms. On Wall Street, even the most bullish predictions for where the index will land at the end of 2025 would only bring the S&P just in line with the performance of most international markets. Another way to compare the S&P’s performance against the rest of the world is by comparing its returns to the MSCI All Country World Excluding U.S. Index, which tracks the indexes of 46 countries. The S&P 500 currently trails this index by more than 10%. That places the S&P on track to broadly underperform the rest of the world this year for only the third time in a decade. The first time, in 2017, after President Donald Trump assumed office for his first term. The most recent instance happened in 2022, when stocks tumbled in response to significant interest rate hikes to combat post-pandemic inflation. This gap in performance partly reflects the trade uncertainty that has cast a shadow over the U.S. economy since Trump began his second term in late January. Trump’s on-again-off-again tariff policies have caused investors around the world to look beyond the United States for more stable, safer opportunities. America’s mounting debt, a sinking U.S. dollar and Trump’s attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve have also given investors pause. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tariffs vs. AI After Trump won the 2024 election, stocks had a strong start to the year. Markets hit record highs in mid-February. But on worries about his tariff policies, markets plunged in March. When Trump rolled out his long-promised tariff policies in early April it sent markets spiraling further, with more than $5.8 trillion of value erased from the S&P 500 in a matter of days. On April 9, Trump announced he was pausing most of his global tariff rollout. Markets soared and the S&P 500 posted its third largest one-day gain in history. The Supreme Court is now considering the fate of Trump’s sweeping tariff agenda. If the administration loses, it could trigger refunds of the duties paid by importers due back to them, forcing the Treasury Department to issue new debt to pay for them, which could drive up yields. While tariff uncertainty has remained and the administration’s trade agenda has hit a number of speed bumps, most notably with China, equities have been buoyed by the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence boom. Trillions of dollars are being poured into the industry by companies and investments have sent the values of firms such as Nvidia, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet soaring to market values as high as $5 trillion. The U.S. currently has nine companies trading above $1 trillion in value. Fears have grown about a potential bubble in the sector. But still, the performance of U.S. stocks broadly lags the world by a wide margin. With AI and tech stocks fueling the momentum, a look at the other 493 companies in the S&P reveals some major differences. For the third quarter, those seven tech stocks are expected to post earnings growth of nearly 15%. The other 493 companies? The expectation is just 6.7%. “The economy is running at two speeds,” ABN AMRO senior economist Rogier Quaedvlieg wrote Tuesday. “AI and related sectors are thriving, whereas most other areas are stagnant or contracting.” The leaders Through Monday, South Korea’s Kospi index held the No. 1 spot. The index that trades on the Korea Stock Exchange has posted a return of nearly 70% this year. “While semiconductor exports remain Korea’s central growth driver, the country is also emerging as a formidable defense exporter,” Franklin Templeton’s Dina Ting recently wrote. “Additionally, South Korea’s stock market has been buoyed by the rebound in its technology sector, notably semiconductors, as demand for memory chips recovers globally,” Ting added. “The country’s leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and AI-related investment are key drivers of this momentum.” After South Korea rank the likes of Kenya, Nigeria, Chile, Poland, Pakistan, Israel, Spain, Czechia and Jordan to round out the top 10. Not until more than 40 countries down the ranking does the S&P 500 appear. One of the ways that trade policies and tariffs have made the gap between the U.S. and other indexes wider than it might otherwise be is by weakening the U.S. dollar. The sinking dollar has helped propel international indexes higher. As the dollar weakens, the values of foreign investments and stock returns rise by comparison. In turn, a rising or stronger dollar would dampen the relative return of money invested outside the U.S. The currency factor The Dollar Index, a measure of the U.S. currency’s strength against a basket of foreign currencies such as the pound, yen, euro, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar, has sunk 9% since the start of 2025. The continued erosion in the dollar’s value makes it more expensive for American companies and consumers to import goods, go on vacation or send money abroad. “I see signs that the attraction of the dollar is slightly eroded, and [the] future will tell whether there is more erosion of that,” European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told CBS News in October. “For a currency to be really trusted you need a few things,” she said. “You need geopolitical credibility, you need the rule of law and strong institutions. And you need a military force that is strong enough.” “I think on at least one and possibly two accounts, the U.S. is still in a very dominant position,” Lagarde continued. But the central banker warned that the U.S. “needs to be very careful because those positions erode over the course of time.” Not everyone agrees. “The dollar’s been on a pretty good run over a long period of time and it’s certainly given back — this year given some of the policy actions — some of the gains, but fundamentally the dollar is the reserve currency of the world,” Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said on Bloomberg Television on Oct. 30. “I don’t see anything at the moment that threatens that.” “I think it’s something to watch, but I’m not concerned that there’s some fundamental shift,” Solomon said. CORRECTION: (Nov. 11, 2025, 6:17 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated how many times in the last 10 years the S&P 500 has not been the world’s top performing stock index. It’s the third time, not the second. And a graphic misstated the S&P’s performance in 2022. It was negative 19.4%, not positive.",left
"Supreme Court ruling against Trump on IEEPA wouldn't mean the end of all tariffs, experts say High tariffs on America's trading partners are likely to remain in place even if the Supreme Court rules that President Trump improperly invoked federal emergency powers to impose the levies, according to trade experts. In a hearing on Wednesday, several of the high court justices appeared skeptical of Mr. Trump's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement sweeping tariffs on nearly every country. Trump administration officials say the policies are needed to reduce the nation's trade deficit and spur domestic manufacturing. Ted Murphy, co-leader of the global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice at law firm Sidley Austin, said Mr. Trump is unlikely to abandon tariffs, noting that the president has other legal tools at his disposal to maintain sharply higher duties on imports. ""Our view is that even if the Supreme Court were to strike down the IEEPA tariffs going forward, the result won't be any different,"" Murphy said. ""The U.S. will be living in a higher tariff rate environment going forward — it just might be under different tariff authorities."" Other statutes the Trump administration could lean on to impose broad tariffs instead of IEEPA include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to impose duties on trade partners to protect national security. Mr. Trump could also draw on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the Department of Commerce would need to investigate whether foreign trade partners engage in any unfair trade practices. Still, a Supreme Court ruling against Mr. Trump would represent a blow to his economic agenda. Murphy noted that the process for implementing Section 232 and 301 tariffs, which Mr. Trump applied to imports such as steel and aluminum during his first term as president, is more limiting and cumbersome than the broad authority granted under IEEPA. ""Section 232 and 301 are the most obvious directions for the administration to turn, but they'd likely take months to conclude, rather than weeks,"" added Patrick Childress, an international trade attorney at Holland & Knight. Potential tariff refunds An adverse ruling for Mr. Trump could require the U.S. government to offer billions of dollars in refunds to businesses. Through August, importers had paid a total of nearly $89 billion in IEEPA tariffs, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of toy company Learning Resources, a plaintiff in the IEEPA case before the Supreme Court, ""I definitely want my money back,"" adding that the ""government has chosen to hit us with a massive tax."" The U.S. has an average tariff rate of 18%, the highest tax on foreign goods since 1934, according to the Yale Budget Lab. Although a ruling against Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA could lead to a refund for businesses, it could also sow more uncertainty, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS News. ""It would be unlikely to significantly alter where we see tariffs ending up in our forecast, and the economic implications,"" she said. ""It is only going to lead to heightened uncertainty regarding trade policy, so it might have a lagged impact on hiring and business investment, similar to what we saw earlier this year."" The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether Mr. Trump would turn to other laws as an avenue for imposing tariffs if the Supreme Court rules against him on using IEEPA. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Wednesday told Fox Business that he's optimistic that the court will rule in Mr. Trump's favor. ""I'm confident that the President's emergency powers…we did have emergencies, the President has dealt with them. He's continuing to deal with them,"" he said. Experts expect a ruling in the case early next year.",left
"Why tariffs might make real Christmas trees more attractive this holiday season Manton, Michigan — At Dutchman Tree Farms in northern Michigan, it's all hands on deck as Americans prepare to deck the halls. More than 1,500 workers cut and wrap row after row of pines. This year, they'll ship out over 500,000 real Christmas trees. Scott Powell helps run the over 9,000-acre family farm. ""Our desire is for folks to put a real live North American-grown Christmas tree in their home,"" Powell told CBS News. ""Tariff-free, that's grown by families."" While Powell's tree prices haven't gone up, the price of imported plastic trees is up. The majority of those are made in Asia and subject to tariffs introduced by President Trump earlier this year. Chris Butler, CEO of the National Tree Company — a company that sells artificial Christmas trees and other holiday-themed products — says tariffs on those items ""basically went from zero"" to between 20% and 30%, ""depending on the country of origin."" Butler said his company has had to pass along some costs to consumers. He estimated that 85% of Americans still choose artificial Christmas trees over real ones, and said he's actively lobbying lawmakers to push for tariff relief. He says the price of an approximately $100 artificial tree has risen about $10 to $15 due to tariffs. ""We want to be treated the same as bananas, coffee, mangoes, etc.,"" Butler said, in reference to an executive order signed by Mr. Trump earlier this month that exempts products including beef, coffee, tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados, cocoa and certain spices from the new tariffs. ""Those things are not grown in the U.S. We know that those are now being exempted. Our raw materials are not available in the U.S. And so we think we should be treated in the same way."" Meanwhile, for the Pena family, it's tradition that drove them to handpick an 8-foot-tall Fraser pine at Dutchman Tree Farms as their Christmas tree. ""The smell triggers those memories growing up, and I just want to provide that for my family,"" David Pena said. It's a scent that farmers like Powell are banking on to boost sales. ""It's the smell and the joy of bringing that real tree into their home,"" Powell said. ""That's what we're really selling.""",left

"It’s finally happening. Three years after Matter launched, the interoperability standard now includes the most popular smart home devices: cameras. Camera support could be the boost Matter needs Matter 1.5 fills a huge gap in the smart home standard’s promise of universal compatibility. We’ll see if the platforms keep up. Camera support could be the boost Matter needs Matter 1.5 fills a huge gap in the smart home standard’s promise of universal compatibility. We’ll see if the platforms keep up. The Matter 1.5 spec, announced today, adds support for all types of video cameras — from indoor and outdoor, wired and battery-powered cameras, to video doorbells, baby monitors, pet cams, and more. Matter support should be possible with an OTA update, so some of your existing cameras could become Matter-compatible. The new spec also adds garage door controllers, soil sensors, bi-directional charging for EVs, and more advanced integration with utilities for energy management. So far, cameras have been among the least interoperable devices in our homes, and bringing them into Matter is a big win for the standard. With Matter, you should be able to add any certified camera to your smart home platform of choice, such as Apple Home, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google Home, and access it there alongside cameras from different manufacturers. “Cameras might create even more momentum [for Matter]. Cameras might leapfrog everything.” Cameras will use Matter-over-WiFi (or ethernet), which, as a local protocol, should improve reliability and latency, especially for things like streaming footage to your smart display and using camera events, such as motion, to trigger other devices and smart home automations. However, all of these benefits will ultimately depend on how each platform and manufacturer decides to implement support — specifically, whether they decide to support cameras in Matter at all. What capabilities will cameras have in Matter? According to the Connectivity Standards Alliance, the organization behind Matter, Matter-certified home security cameras will support live video and audio streaming, two-way talk, and local and remote access. The standard also allows for pan-tilt-zoom controls for the cameras and the setting of detection and privacy zones. Along with streaming, Matter 1.5 enables continuous and event-based recording, with the option to store recordings locally or in the cloud. But it doesn’t cover the storage of that footage. Instead, Matter hands off to whatever local or cloud storage options are available from the device makers and platforms. “It should be possible for most modern cameras on the market today, and in people’s homes, to be updated to support Matter.” This means a camera company could support Matter, but still require a cloud subscription in order for you to review recorded footage, Chris LaPré, head of strategy at the CSA, told The Verge in an interview. Additionally, while Matter support will likely be an add-on to a camera manufacturer’s connectivity options at first, the local storage route presents the possibility that someone could develop a network video recording (NVR) system that records everything locally, works with every smart home platform (that supports cameras in Matter), and never touches the cloud. With Matter, all footage will be encrypted in transit, with end-to-end data encryption available “if the ecosystem wants to use it,” says LaPré. The standard supports streaming using the popular WebRTC protocol and access via STUN and TURN. It will also support TCP transport. This covers all the different streaming technologies camera companies use, he says, which is one of the reasons it took a while to bring cameras into the spec. “We didn’t want to piecemeal this,” says LaPré. “We wanted to launch with a full-scoped spec.” (If you want to dig into the nitty-gritty, check out the Matter camera Device Type GitHub page.) Matter doesn’t specify or limit the resolution of camera footage, nor does it dictate or manage features such as AI-powered detection types (person, package, etc.). These will be part of how camera manufacturers and platforms can differentiate their offerings — through adding things like AI-powered descriptive alerts (which Ring, Arlo, Wyze, and Google Nest offer). The CSA says the standard is backward compatible. “It should be possible for most modern cameras on the market today, and in people’s homes, to be updated to support Matter,” LaPré says. However, which models will get the update is entirely up to each manufacturer. When will Apple, Google, and Amazon support Matter cameras? Based on previous rollouts, it takes at least a year from the release of a specification to achieve market penetration of devices. It’s been three years since Matter 1.0 was released, and we have plenty of lightbulbs, smart plugs, and locks. But other device types have taken longer. Household appliance support arrived in 2023 with Matter 1.2, but there are still only a handful of Matter-certified appliances. However, with backwards compatibility and the huge popularity of cameras, I anticipate we’ll see movement a lot faster here — probably beginning with CES 2026, which is just two months away. Aqara, a strong supporter of Matter, is aiming for the first half of 2026 to launch its first Matter camera. Cathy You of Aqara tells me that the company also plans to add Matter support to some existing cameras. Eve, another early supporter of the standard, won’t be updating its existing Eve Cam and Eve Outdoor Cam. Lars Felber of Eve says it’s not technically feasible, but that they plan to introduce Matter-enabled models at some point. The big three — Apple Home, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google Home — have been glacially slow to adopt new Matter device types. I asked Amazon whether Ring or Blink will support Matter, and spokesperson Melanie Garvey said, “We don’t support the Matter standard in our cameras, and we don’t have a timeline for when we will.” Google declined to comment on its Nest cameras. I also reached out to several other camera manufacturers, including Arlo, Reolink, and Eufy, and will report back if I receive a response. Of course, none of this will make much difference unless the platforms support cameras. And the big three — Apple Home, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google Home — have been glacially slow to adopt new Matter device types. Google Home only added local control of lights, plugs, and switches last week. But it seems likely that Apple will support cameras in Matter. Especially as, according to the Matter GitHub project, one of the leads on the camera project is Aron Rosenberg, an Apple Engineer previously of Logitech, which developed some of the first cameras with support for Apple’s HomeKit Secure Video service. I reached out to Apple, but have not gotten a response. If they do, presumably Matter cameras would connect to Apple Home’s existing HomeKit Secure Video platform and process video locally in your home on an Apple Home Hub, such as an Apple TV or HomePod. My guess is we won’t see support any earlier than next spring, which is when we might be getting a new HomePod Mini and Apple TV, according to ongoing rumors. SmartThings will probably jump on adoption. Samsung abandoned its first-party camera hardware years ago, and Matter could provide the platform with the opportunity for broader camera support it desperately needs. Home Assistant’s Gord Cameron tells me support is on the roadmap, but points out that Home Assistant is already pretty good at integrating cameras. “Some of our tech really lines up well with the Matter camera implementation,” he says. “But there are a couple of things we need to develop into Home Assistant (like two-way audio for smart doorbells) before we can fully implement Matter cameras.” As for Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa, considering their new AI-powered assistants are so closely integrated with their in-house camera brands (Nest and Ring, respectively), and they have been rolling out new AI-powered features at a pace, I don’t anticipate a speedy uptake for Matter. However, both companies have long touted how open their smart home platforms are, so I don’t see them letting Apple take the lead. A lot of this will depend on momentum — how many camera manufacturers jump onto Matter, which in turn will hinge on how many platforms support it. Cameras were always a major missing piece for the Matter standard. On paper, the implementation checks all the right boxes. It really feels like they’ve done this right. Combined with the recent momentum gained by companies like Ikea and Philips Hue putting their full support behind Matter, it could be a big boost to the standard. “We heard from a lot of people that once you have cameras, we’ll be more interested,” says LaPré. “Cameras might create even more momentum, cameras might leapfrog everything.” Matter 1.5 also brings better energy management and garage door controls More energy management Recent Matter updates have focused on developing the standard’s energy management features. A truly interoperable standard will make it much easier to control the energy use of appliances in your home across various brands. Matter 1.5 rounds out the infrastructure needed to make this happen with a new “electrical energy tariff” device type. This will allow utilities to integrate with Matter and share real-time and forecasted pricing, along with how clean the energy on the grid is. Then, Matter devices in your home can receive that data and automatically adjust, either independently or through a Matter smart home platform with energy management capabilities. “How and when energy is used should ideally be a whole-home decision,” says LaPré. “There’s a need to coordinate when devices like the EV charger, dishwasher, and pool pump run, in order to balance usage.” The energy tariff device type can also incorporate real-time or predictive data from a solar installation, allowing your home energy management system to track both the energy you generate and the energy you use. Plus, utilities can use Matter to tell your home about the needs of the grid. This could bring more fine-grained control for those who participate in demand response programs — where the energy company lowers your energy use (for example, by raising the temperature on your smart thermostat) when the grid is under strain. The final energy management update in 1.5 is support for bi-directional EV charging, which lets you use your EV to power your home. It’s all great infrastructure for energy management, but so far, there are no Matter-certified products you can buy to support this. Garage door controllers arrive Matter now finally supports garage door controllers. Despite being announced as one of the first device types Matter would support (and a couple of companies coming out with work-arounds), garage door controllers haven’t been part of the Matter spec until now. With 1.5 and a new “Support for Closures,” the category is now official. Closures will also cover a variety of devices that go up and down or side to side, such as shades, drapes, awnings, and gates, and enable more motion types than are currently supported in the spec. This should bring more control options to fancier shades, such as those that open from top to bottom. A smarter garden Soil sensors, which measure moisture and temperature, are now a device type in Matter. These should be able to feed data to a smart sprinkler or other irrigation system, to help automate watering. The Matter 1.5 spec officially launches today, meaning developers can start working with the SDK and test tools. But, as mentioned, it will likely be several months, if not years, before we start to see any of these products in our homes. What is Matter? Matter is a smart home interoperability standard designed to provide a common language for connected devices to communicate locally in your home without relying on a cloud connection. It is built to be secure and private, easy to set up, and widely compatible. Developed by Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung (and others), Matter is an open-sourced, IP-based connectivity software layer for smart home devices. It works over Wi-Fi, ethernet, and the low-power mesh networking protocol Thread, and currently supports most of the main device types in the home. These include security cameras, lighting, thermostats, locks, robot vacuums, refrigerators, dishwashers, dryers, ovens, smoke alarms, air-quality monitors, EV chargers, and more. A smart home gadget with the Matter logo can be set up and used with a Matter-compatible platform via a Matter controller and controlled by more than one platform via a feature called multi-admin. Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, and Apple Home are some of the major smart home platforms supporting Matter, along with hundreds of device manufacturers.",left

"There’s a narrative that Democrats are adrift or, at the very minimum, bereft of obvious leaders. Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries aren’t very popular, and none of the 2028 contenders seem, outside of redistricting brawler Gavin Newsom, to stir the blood all that much. Yet after Tuesday night, there’s much for Democrats to celebrate. Virtually every election result, from New Jersey to Virginia to Georgia to California, was exceedingly good for them. Every faction of the party could exult in the outcomes: Leftists got their new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, and moderates spiked the football over the ascensions of Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger. Virtually all Democrats were thrilled that Proposition 50 passed in California, allowing Newsom to oversee a Democratic gerrymander that can counter the Texas GOP’s. There are plenty of similarities between 2025 and 2017, another strong off-year for Democrats that foreshadowed the blue wave of 2018. The greater reality, which even chest-thumping Democrats may not want to acknowledge just yet, is that MAGA is in twilight. In the days before his inauguration, Donald Trump was actually liked by a majority of Americans. He had won a popular-vote election, and voters were largely disillusioned with all the Democrats had to offer, whether it was Joe Biden slipping into senility or milquetoast Kamala Harris. While MAGA will never quite believe it, they will probably never have it as good again as they did in January 2025. Americans had given Trump a second chance. Enough of them earnestly believed he was going to address the cost-of-living crisis and begin to make their lives better. As disorienting and terrifying and overwhelming as second term Trump has been, the elections on Tuesday demonstrated the fundamental — and likely unfixable — flaw of the entire MAGA movement. It revolves fully around Trump and can only thrive if he sits at the top of the ticket. And since it is so deeply tied to one man, his failures undercut whatever populist realignment they believed was possible at the close of 2024. Today, Trump is unpopular, with most polls showing a significant dip since the start of the year. During his first term as president, and again as a candidate over the last several years, he was a trusted voice on the economy because he was a businessman who once presided, through luck, over an era of low inflation. That economic edge is now gone. The tariff regime is alienating, housing and grocery prices remain stubbornly high, and Trump has given little indication he cares about — or can focus on — this affordability problem. Americans wanted a tighter border, not marauding, maniacal ICE agents in their streets, and almost no one asked for DOGE, National Guard invasions, or furious crackdowns on free speech. Again and again, Trump and his most vicious cronies, including Stephen Miller, have tried to manufacture crises to justify all of this gross federal overreach. It’s obvious enough that most Americans aren’t buying it. They’re sick of Trump and weary of what MAGA stands for. And for the many rank-and-file Republicans who have hitched their wagons to Trump over the last decade, a new reality is settling in: Trump, in fact, isn’t eternal. It’s always possible that Trump, in his 80s, decides to violate the Constitution and seek a third term, but that seems to be growing more unlikely, if Trump’s own public pronouncements are to be believed. For younger Republicans, there is very much life after Trump, and they’re going to have to start contemplating it — especially as the Supreme Court readies to potentially invalidate his tariffs and the odds of Democrats storming to a House majority in 2027 keep increasing. Republicans are still favored to hold the Senate, and Trump will be the most powerful man in the world for another three years. But no matter who his successor is — J.D. Vance is most likely, followed by Marco Rubio — none of them are him. Trump’s charisma fused the disparate factions of MAGA and kept a great deal of peace within the Republican tent. When he exits the scene, there will be a bloody contest for the future of the movement and the Republican Party itself. Still in full control of the federal government for at least another year, Trump and his MAGA allies can exert themselves plenty. They can keep bullying Democrat-run cities, harassing college students, and terrorizing immigrants. They can indulge their autocratic fantasies. What they can’t do is force Americans to like any of it. The old fascist regimes, or even the Bush-Cheney post-9/11 regency, had — at least in the beginning — a great deal of popular buy-in. The masses collectively yearned for that style of punishing leadership. Trump won a popular vote by less than two points and has governed like he was delivered a far greater mandate. He squandered whatever goodwill he had with the public, and MAGA’s future is now much murkier than it was a year ago. The final dark question is how Trump will exit the scene. Scenarios of an illegal presidential run or an attempted seizure of power must be entertained, as well as the possibility of Vance, or another Republican, trying to steal an election in the event of a loss. As unlikely as it is, Trump could try to declare martial law and somehow cancel elections. With him, everything is on the table. The saving grace, in the end, might be federalism — it’s the states and counties that control election apparatuses, not the president — and MAGA’s deficit of competence. Full-blown autocracy is very hard to implement. As the days tick down in 2025, Trump may be finally understanding this.",left

"There’s a lot of talk about an AI bubble these days. Could that, paradoxically, be a good thing? “It appears to be conventional wisdom that we are in some form of a bubble”, said high-profile entrepreneur and marketing professor Scott Galloway in a recent podcast. He rattled off some recent headlines: Bill Gates likening AI to the dot-com bubble, short seller Michael Burry doubling down on AI bubble warnings, and even Vogue asking if fashion is “ready for the AI bubble to burst”. Meanwhile, Bank of America’s latest fund manager survey shows more than half think AI stocks are already in bubble territory. As for retail investors, a recent American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) poll showed bearishness hitting its highest level since April’s tariff chaos. However, a new study, Bubble Beliefs, suggests the ubiquity of bubble talk may actually be a sign that a crash isn’t coming. It found that during past boom-busts, analysts projected near-miraculous earnings and expected further gains, short interest stayed low and the media almost never uttered the B-word. READ MORE In most cases, from Yahoo! in 1999 to any number of forgotten high-flyers, attention surged but few raised any doubts. Instead, “optimism portends crashes”, with the most bullish forecasts predicting the highest crash risk. There were exceptions, such as the media clearly flagging 2021’s GameStop bubble. Generally, however, periods of heavier media coverage are actually linked to a slightly lower risk of a crash, highlighting how little awareness there usually is of an emerging bubble. Today? Instead of euphoria, there is anxiety; instead of uncritical cheerleading, a chorus of warnings. True, some AI valuations look very stretched. But historically, it seems, markets that are worried about being in a bubble tend not to be.",left
"Supreme Court justices appear skeptical of Trump's tariffs, but some may give leeway At least five justices shared concern about Trump’s unprecedented tariffs. In one of the most significant legal cases for President Donald Trump's administration, the Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared skeptical of the president’s claim of unbounded tariff authority -- though some of the justices signaled a potential willingness to give the president some flexibility on foreign trade. While the Trump administration faced broad skepticism from the court, some of the justices suggested that the president could use tariffs as a tool to regulate trade, rather than generate revenue. Such a reading of the law at the center of the case could provide Trump an opening -- along with other tariffs that have not been challenged in court -- to continue his global-trotting mission to reshape trade imbalances, even if the high court curtails his broad tariff power. “It's very important that they are regulatory tariffs, not revenue-raising tariffs,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the justices. “This policy is by far the most effective if nobody ever pays the tariffs.” Specifically, Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Justice Neil Gorsuch zeroed in on language in IEEPA that says a president may ""regulate importation"" in times of emergencies using ""licenses, instructions, or otherwise."" “We’ve been focused on regulating importation, but actually the statute says the President may, by means of licenses or otherwise, regulate importation,” said Gorsuch. “We’ve had some discussion today about the fact that maybe the president could simply recharacterize these tariffs as licenses or rejigger the scheme so that they are licenses.” Barrett similarly suggested that the Trump administration might be able to reframe the tariffs as licenses to avoid legal scrutiny. “Tell me what the distinction is between licenses and fees if it matters?” she asked. “If there really is no distinction, why couldn't you just call it a license here?” Neal Katyal, who argued on behalf of the small business that brought the case, pushed back on the idea that simply rebranding Trump’s tariffs would resolve the legal issue. “If you were to do that, it’s open-ended,” he said. “It allows, under the word license… to tariff the world.” Overall, a majority of the justices appeared skeptical of the broad interpretation of the 1977 law governing emergency economic powers that the Trump administration claims provides unlimited tariff power. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act gives Trump the power to “regulate importation” but does not explicitly mention tariffs, and some of the justices expressed concern that the current tariffs amount to a tax on US citizens. “It’s a congressional power, not a presidential power, to tax. And you want to say tariffs are not taxes, but that’s exactly what they are,” said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Multiple justices also raised concerns that no other president or court has determined that the phrase “regulate importation” confers tariff authority. “Can you point to any other place in the code -- or any other time in history -- where that phrase, together, ‘regulate importation’ has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?” Barrett asked. There was no apparent consensus on whether the Court might entirely strike down Trump's sweeping global tariffs -- a centerpiece of his economic agenda -- or otherwise clarify limits on his authority in some way; however, several conservative justices indicated a desire to find a way to preserve Trump's tariff regimen, noting the practical considerations of invalidating it and the traditional deference given to presidents on matters of foreign affairs. “If you win, tell me how the reimbursement process would work. Would it be a complete mess?” said Justice Amy Coney Barrett. “It’s difficult, absolutely, we don’t deny that,” Katyal later said. IEEPA has been used to justify nearly 70% of Trump’s tariffs -- including his global reciprocal tariffs and tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico -- and has resulted in the collection of more than $89 billion. Depending on the Supreme Court’s decision, that money could be returned to the businesses that have already paid the levy on the goods they imported into the United States. Even if the court determines that IEEPA does not give unlimited tariff power, the high court could consider defining a much more limited authority that falls within Trump’s power. Barrett and Gorsuch floated the idea of using licenses instead of tariffs or more narrowly tailoring tariffs that seek to regulate, rather than raise funds. “So revenue-raising tariffs are not foreign affairs, but regulatory tariffs are?” asked Gorsuch “I don't think a revenue-raising tariff would be foreign affairs, to the same degree at least. I think it has a foreign application, obviously, but I don't think it would raise the same issues,” Sauer said. However, Trump’s own rhetoric might cut against that argument, with the president frequently boasting about the amount of money raised through his tariffs and its impact on the U.S. deficit. On Wednesday, at the same time as the Supreme Court oral arguments, he told business leaders in Florida about “big numbers” generated by his tariffs. ""At the same time, my tariffs are bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars into helping slash the deficit this year by more than 50%. Did you see those numbers? We're going to be down 50%. Anywhere from 25 to 50, but closer to 50%. Who would think of that one? Those are big numbers,"" Trump said.",left
"Near the end of his opinion in Trump v. United States, Chief Justice John Roberts chastises the dissenting justices for “ignoring the Constitution’s separation of powers” and “fear mongering on the basis of extreme hypotheticals” that imagine a future ruled by a lawbreaking president. He might as well have called them hysterical. Among their fears: a world where the commander-in-chief orders the armed forces to assassinate a political opponent or critic, a president takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon, and a leader wields any of his vast powers as top law enforcer in ways Congress has deemed criminal for everyone else. The 6-3 decision in favor of Donald Trump did more than halt the first-ever criminal prosecution of a former U.S. president, who was charged with the first-ever criminal conspiracy to unlawfully remain in power. Roberts wasn’t interested in those “present exigencies,” let alone in how his ruling might be received by the public or the political branches; he told us he was looking to “the future of our Republic.” That future is here and now. And in the parade of recent Trump-administration power grabs, you can find traces of Roberts’s thinking from the case. The vindictive prosecutions of James Comey and Letitia James, to name one aftershock of the ruling, can be directly tied to Roberts’s hair-raising conception of the prosecutorial function as not apolitical and independent but a blunt instrument the president can reach for without any restrictions. Is there any recourse against a president who orders his Justice Department, as Trump recently mused, to pay him a settlement of nearly a quarter-billion dollars — an act of self-dealing so far beyond the normal course that it may even violate the presidential bar on self-enrichment with public funds? Since the chief justice reasoned that the president holds “exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials,” the answer is “no.” And what about the military strikes on vessels on the Caribbean and the Pacific, without any basis in law, that have killed dozens of civilians suspected of transporting narcotics? Are drug cartels, which Trump has designated as terrorist organizations, now fair game because “their actions constitute an armed attack against the United States,” as he informed Congress? Once again, the chief justice would reason that scrutinizing these conclusions is off limits too, because the president commands the armed forces and his duties include “managing matters related to terrorism, trade, and immigration.” And confirming what one scholar of executive power has observed about Trump’s shield, its protections would extend to subordinate officials who carry out even patently illegal orders. Likewise, because the president has the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, neither Congress nor the courts are allowed to take any steps to rein in that power. Because clemency lies “within his exclusive sphere of constitutional authority,” Roberts has admonished, the president is absolutely immune from any criminal prosecution arising from its improper use. Under this rubric, there’s nothing Congress and the courts can do about Trump’s pardon of Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, which has gone to great lengths to legitimize and enrich the president and his family’s burgeoning crypto empire. These actions track some of the “nightmare scenarios” the dissenting justices hoped would never come to pass as a result of Trump v. United States. “In every use of official power,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her prescient response to Roberts, “the President is now a king above the law.” The worst may be yet to come. Over the next three months, the Supreme Court will consider a string of cases that, together, could well cement the head of the executive branch as the centerpiece of the Constitution — leaving Congress, the judiciary, and all 50 states at the mercy of a president who doesn’t believe in the separation of powers as much as in his own. One of the grievances for which this nation declared independence from King George III was the militarization of daily life. But in ways that might have horrified the people who came up with the idea of a country where Congress decides when and how state militias can be called into federal service, since this past summer, Trump has led an unprecedented effort to bring them under his control. And unlike other Trump-era excesses, this attempt to set up the National Guard as a roving police force — without bounds and only against Democratic-led cities and states that oppose him — could irreparably alter how federal and state governments relate to each other. A key ingredient in this distortion of the constitutional design is a concerted plan to sideline judges. The administration has been waging a relentless campaign to shut the courts entirely out of deciding whether the president may nationalize the Guard — in effect conscripting states, against their governors’ wishes, to provide Trump with his own personal army. So far, lower courts in California, Oregon, and Illinois have been holding the line. A federal judge in Chicago and the appeals court there rejected the contention that the president has “unreviewable discretion” to deploy the military domestically. And both courts cast doubt that facts on the ground there, as the law requires, amount to a “rebellion” or else have deteriorated to such a degree that Trump is “unable” to execute the laws of the United States, as the statute allowing the president to call forth the Guard commands. Yet the Trump administration continues to press these same radical, anti-judge arguments in an emergency petition filed in October with the Supreme Court, leaning heavily on Roberts’s language in the immunity ruling for the proposition that judges are the ones irreparably harming Trump’s power to direct his subordinates, with the National Guard’s assistance, to help him faithfully execute the laws. “The President’s authority to fulfill his constitutional mandate would be seriously undermined if courts could second-guess his judgments,” D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, wrote. But if not judges, then who? As the appeals court hearing Trump v. Illinois saw it, Congress did not make the president the final arbiter of the facts required to trigger such sweeping powers. “Nothing in the text of § 12406 makes the President the sole judge of whether these preconditions exist,” the judges there wrote. “It follows that the President’s decision to federalize and deploy the National Guard under the statute is reviewable.” The Supreme Court may have other ideas down the line, but in an encouraging sign, the justices, at least in this one area, seem more interested in order rather than in chaos. Last week, they ordered Illinois and the Trump administration to address whether the phrase regular forces, as outlined in the law, “refers to the regular forces of the United States military.” What that means, in plain English, is that the Supreme Court may be inclined to let Congress rule the day here — by holding Trump to the requirement that he cannot federalize the National Guard unless the conditions on the ground are truly warlike, such that not even the U.S. military, which the president controls, can contain them. A totalitarian understanding of the president’s authority, one in which he alone can be the judge of the facts and the laws that apply to the executive branch, without regard for courts and the legislature, arises with equal urgency in three back-to-back disputes slated for oral argument between now and January. And in all of them, the administration is banking on Roberts’s extreme pronouncements on presidential power over the years to offer Trump a lifeline. The tariffs cases, which the justices heard Wednesday, mark the first time in modern history that a president has unilaterally invoked emergency powers to impose sweeping levies on other nation that then the rest of us end up paying for. “Tariffs are taxes,” Neal Katyal, the superlawyer representing the small businesses challenging Trump’s tariffs, said at the outset of his presentation. “They take dollars from Americans’ pockets and deposit them in the U.S. Treasury. Yet here, the president bypassed Congress and imposed one of the largest tax increases in our lifetime.” At their most basic, the cases ask, Who gets to impose tariffs? A secondary question: Are tariffs a “major question” that Roberts and his colleagues should closely examine? Quoting James Madison, the specialized appeals court that ruled decisively against Trump on these questions wrote that the Founding Father had once dismissed the concern that a president “may easily become a king” because Congress controlled the money. “The purse is in the hands of the representatives of the people,” Madison said. Because he claims to be responding to “unusual and extraordinary” threats from abroad, Trump insists that his word and his alone controls in this area. As Sauer put it, emergencies of this kind “are essentially judicially unreviewable.” To make this point stick, one of many arguments the administration is throwing at the wall is the idea, drawn from Roberts’s thinking in the Muslim-ban case from 2018, that presidents use “leverage” in the foreign-affairs realm to obtain concessions from other nations, and thus judges must either yield or be highly deferential in that area. “The Court made clear that second-guessing that use of leverage would be ‘inconsistent with the broad statutory text and the deference traditionally accorded the President in this sphere,’” Sauer wrote in the main brief supporting the tariffs. On Wednesday, he added that the emergency justifying the tariffs was “existential.” Extreme deference to Trump’s ability to declare anything that walks an emergency, which would enshrine his haphazard approach to slapping on tariffs whenever anyone slights him, would leave the world’s economy, if not the global order, in dire straits. But the Supreme Court is not being asked to end Trump’s trade war; its job, as in other controversies on the Trump docket in the past nine months, is not to let the presidency eat up the other branches — and forever cede Congress’s power of the purse when the world’s greatest deliberative body, however feebly, is trying to reclaim it. Neil Gorsuch, of all people, seemed troubled by the idea that a future president—perhaps Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—declaring a global climate emergency and imposing a 50-percent tariff on all gas-powered cars and auto parts. “What president’s ever going to give that power back?” Gorsuch asked. “A pretty rare president.” Yet if exerting economic pain or rattling the markets without safeguards is the goal, the Supreme Court may yet give the president even more power to do just that in Trump v. Slaughter and Trump v. Cook, a pair of related cases the justices will hear in December and January, respectively, that are expected to settle the independence of the Federal Trade Commission and the leadership of the Federal Reserve for good. Congress long ago determined both agencies should be insulated from direct presidential control and influence by vesting their leaders with fixed terms and for-cause removal protections. And the Supreme Court, in the landmark Humphrey’s Executor v. United States (1935), confirmed this structure was constitutional. In this regard, both the FTC and the Fed are virtually indistinguishable in their design. “There is no legal difference between Jerome Powell and me,” Rebecca Slaughter, the Democratic FTC commissioner Trump unlawfully fired in March, said of her status under the law at the time. Powell, whom Trump has been raring to oust since his return to power, has said as much. Yet since taking office, Trump has had other ideas. And Chief Justice Roberts, acting on his own or alongside his supermajority, has all but overruled Humphrey’s in response — effectively unsettling the congressional structure that for decades has guided the work of the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, to name but a few agencies the Court has let Trump bring under his thumb. And doing so without overruling the very precedent that, as Justice Elena Kagan recently complained, “prevents the majority from giving the President the unlimited removal power Congress denied him.” The Justice Department, with the wind at its back, is embracing Roberts’s language in the immunity decision and earlier precedents defanging other independent agencies to say Trump’s firing authority is “conclusive and preclusive” and thus “may not be regulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts.” There’s even a suggestion, culled from Roberts’s own words, that Trump may direct the FTC’s investigative functions — which can be read as an invitation to corruptly influence the industries and corporate giants that come under scrutiny (or not) for anti-competitive behavior. Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, who remains on the job despite Trump’s attempt to fire her over questionable allegations of mortgage fraud, may well be the sole survivor of this unrestricted firing spree. She has Roberts to thank: Back in May, while kneecapping the NLRB, he and the court’s supermajority went out on a limb to recognize that the Federal Reserve is “uniquely structured” and holds a “distinct historical tradition” — a made-up-from-whole-cloth distinction that Kagan has ridiculed as the “creation of a bespoke Federal Reserve exception” devised to “reassure the markets.” Yet that hasn’t stopped the administration from insisting, relying on Roberts’s grand vision for the presidency in the immunity ruling, that Cook should go because the president said so — and that the courts have no business examining his reasons for that decision. As Sauer wrote, looking into Trump’s motives for firing Cook would, pace Roberts, “seriously cripple the proper and effective administration of public affairs.” Unless and until the chief justice and the Supreme Court take steps to disempower the anti-constitutional Frankenstein’s monster they have created and have been feeding, the future may well include a president free to militarize our streets, set monetary policy on a whim, pick and choose the taxes U.S. consumers pay for basic goods, and personally decide whom the government investigates, prosecutes, or worse. Unencumbered by Congress, the courts, and other safeguards in the constitutional scheme, that future is closer than it appears.",left
"Irish technology companies saw venture capital backing rise 8 per cent in the third quarter of the year, new data shows, as the impact of US tariffs on international investors faded. But funding for the first nine months of the year was down 10 per cent year on year, data compiled by the Irish Venture Capital Association (IVCA) said, and early deals suffered. A total of €207.9 million was ploughed into Irish small and medium-sized enterprises in the third quarter, according to the Irish Venture Capital Association Venture Pulse survey, published in association with William Fry. That followed a “dismal” second quarter, when funding dropped to its lowest in 10 years, following the US announcement of Liberation Day tariff plans in April, shaking international investor confidence. READ MORE However, the latest data indicated investors had started to return to the market, with backing from overseas investors more than doubling to €146.7 million in the current quarter compared with €69.5 million in the second quarter. “Hopefully we are starting to see some confidence and stability return to the market, but it remains a challenging time for early-stage companies,” said IVCA chairperson Caroline Gaynor. Gaps also remained in some areas in the third quarter, with deals for seed funding and those under €1 million yielding less positive results. Year on year, seed rounds fell by 30 per cent to €23.4 million, and by 31 per cent for the first nine months of the year. Total funding for the first nine months stood at €853.4 million, down from €945.3 million in 2024. “The process for deploying the Government’s €250 million Enterprise Ireland Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2025-2029 is well under way,” said IVCA director general Sarah-Jane Larkin. “We are optimistic that the environment for very early stage Irish companies seeking first-round funding will pick up in the first half of next year.” Deals in the €1 million to €5 million range accounted for 30 out of the 39 transactions in the quarter, with those in the €1 million to €3 million up 35 per cent year on year. Deals in the €3 million to €5 million range were up 18 per cent. But funding in the €10 million to €30 million category was down by two-thirds, declining to €26 million, while deals up to €10 million were down by 74 per cent to €13.5 million. In the €30 million and over category, standout deals included €62 million raised by ProVerum, while AI machine learning firm Nory raised €34 million. Life sciences topped the list for funding this year to date, followed by cybersecurity, AI and machine learning, fintech and software.",left
"Transcript: New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,"" Nov. 9, 2025 The following is the transcript of the interview with New Jersey Gov.-elect , a Democrat, that aired on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" on Nov. 9, 2025. MARGARET BRENNAN: Friday we spoke to one of the other big Democratic winners last Tuesday, New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who is currently a member of Congress – and asked whether given her new role as the chief executive of a state hard hit by the shutdown, she would support the Democratic Party position of blocking government funding until Obamacare subsidies are extended. REP. SHERRILL: Well, it's really important that we keep up that fight, because we see in the market, costs going up by 175% if the Republicans don't address this health care crisis. We know that there have already been huge cuts in the One Big, Beautiful Bill to people's access to health care. And you know, when we look at this crisis, so much of it is really imposed by Donald Trump. So there is money for him to put towards SNAP funding that he's refusing to do, even though courts are demanding it. Now he's kind of slow walking it, making it very difficult for states to do that illegally, and courts are holding him accountable. We see with air traffic control problem, some of this is because the administration hasn't moved quickly enough at Newark in some of the problems we had over the summer. So we're already down by 25%. Now, with this crisis going on because the President refuses to open up the government, we're seeing another 10% in flights being derailed, and we see continued late and delayed flights. So, it's time that the government- that the Trump administration, that Republicans in the House and the Senate, get serious about opening up government. MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at our recent polling, a majority of Americans are really concerned that this shutdown is going to hurt the overall economy. How can you justify the damage? REP. SHERRILL: Well, it truly is hurting the economy, and you can't justify the damage, which is why the President and the Senate and Republican majority in the House need to get this government open, and they need to do so in a way that's going to stop punishing the American people. I think what we saw with this election is the American people, you know, really demanding that our federal government operate in a way that is going to stop punishing them economically. I'll tell you I ran on affordability, on the fact that I'm going to fight in Trenton to make sure we're cutting through red tape and permitting to drive down costs, but also that I'm going to continue to fight that- for Washington, to address things like the tariff program, which is raising costs and everything from a cup of coffee to groceries, to fight the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' which is continuing to raise costs on education and innovation, housing, health care, to continue to fight this government shutdown so that we can really address health care needs here in the state. MARGARET BRENNAN: You keep saying it's up to the president to reopen the government, but you withheld your own vote on that continuing resolution, that short term funding bill, and over in the Senate, Leader Thune is tearing into Democrats for that decision. He said, It shows you're not caring that there are men and women in uniform frequenting food banks because of the shutdown, not making rent payments, trying to borrow. He said, Dems view this as leverage, and he used that word because it was your House leadership, Katherine Clark, justified withholding votes to end the shutdown, saying that's one of the few parts of leverage that Democrats have. How do you respond to this accusation that it's actually Democrats who are being heartless here? REP. SHERRILL: Well, when you have the Republicans that have the presidency, they have the majority in the Senate, they have the majority in the House. They've even, many would say- including myself, taken over the court system. Then they have a responsibility to open up this government, and I have to tell you as a veteran myself, I know how devastating that is – (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: It was Whip Clark who said those votes are leverage. REP. SHERRILL: We're- leverage to serve the American people. I mean, we see again and again these Republican attacks on everything from health care. Look, if if they don't fund the Affordable Care Act, costs are going to go up by 175% for people here in New Jersey, at already high levels. That is going to kick so many people off health care that's on top of the huge Medicare cuts that we're seeing in the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' on top of the tariff cuts that are raising grocery prices everywhere, on top of the fight he's in now, which is raising gas prices. So again and again, we're seeing the Trump administration punishing people, and these Republicans have got to come to the table, and they've got to start really working for the American people, and this election showed that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you were talking about the extension of the health care subsidies, why isn't the promise to hold a vote on those health care subsidies enough for Democrats to vote to reopen the government? REP. SHERRILL: So we are working hard to address the concerns for the American people, and Republicans, again and again, are refusing to address that. So right now-- (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the leader Thune said they'll hold a vote-- REP. SHERRILL: --part of how we get the government open and they should do it right now, I think we have seen what the promises that Republicans have made have been worth. What he needs to do is actually put the subsidies in. We can serve the American people, we can drive down health care costs, and that's really key. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk a bit about your election. As you said, the economy was front and center for you. Energy prices in particular, you focused in on. In New Jersey, they're up 19% over the past year, versus 6% nationwide. I know you want to declare a state of emergency day one, but what does it actually mean? How quickly will prices come down? REP. SHERRILL: So the state of emergency will freeze rate hikes, because there are some rate hikes that are set to come into play in the next several months, and I- you know, I'm not going to allow those to be put on the back of the New Jersey rate payer, and we see that the can has been kicked down the road by too many people. So the utility companies have already come to the table to say, okay, let's negotiate those rate hikes. We have money that comes in through the BPU to defray the cost. But what's really going to also happen is, very quickly, I'm turning to adding a lot of power to our grid. Right now, PJM, that's our regional grid operator, has really screwed up the market for various reasons, and so every electron we produce in New Jersey will defray the cost of elect- of electricity we have to buy on the market. So that's why, immediately, I'm going to cut through red tape and permitting delays to get solar done. We're going to continue to build out battery storage, and then in the first budget, we will expand modernization of our natural gas facilities, and in the long term, nuclear. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said on CNN this past week that there's a feeling working people have not been heard, and that there's too much caution and mediocrity in the Democratic Party today. What? What did you mean by that? REP. SHERRILL: That- as I was talking to people across the state, thousands of people, they wanted to see an agenda to get their costs down, and something that was going to take place quickly. As I said, you know, I'm not writing a strongly worded letter. I'm not doing a 10 year plan. I'm on day one declaring a state of emergency, not just because I'm furious that, you know, as too many people have failed New Jersey rate payers, that the costs are being dumped on them. Yes, that is a huge problem for me that I'm addressing, but it also, I think, conveys that sense of urgency that I feel to work for the people of New Jersey, so that they know that this is a day one issue for me. They also want to see somebody though that has their backs, because they know that these tariffs are raising costs. They know that the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' is going to take away their health care. They know that attacks on the Gateway Tunnel Project are going to raise costs here and really cut into job opportunities. So they want to know that whoever is governing is going to be focused on governing for them, not a party of one like Donald Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your criticism there was of fellow Democrats, as I understood it. But let me ask you about Speaker Emeritus, Nancy Pelosi. She just announced that she is going to be leaving Congress. When I spoke to her last on this program, she indicated that she knows it's a problem recruiting new candidates, in part because of the environment we're in, including just how nasty our politics are and the security threats. And she said that's discouraging- in particular women who fear the impact on children. What do you say to those considering for office right now? Are you seeing that that female candidates are fearful of doing what you just did? REP. SHERRILL: Well, we've worked very hard here in New Jersey to really build out a future and an idea that's going to bring everybody in and- and really working hard to keep people safe. Public safety is a huge issue for me and for people across the state. As we double down on our constitutional protections, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, etc., but it is a scary time. I remember right after I won my primary, the assassinations in Minnesota took place, and here I have four kids, and I'm suddenly thinking, oh my gosh, am I putting them at risk by running? But you know what? I think most of us are weighing as moms if we're candidates is, what is my kids' future look like if I don't run? And that's on balance, I think people are choosing to run. I see women across our state running. We have, you know, people newly getting into races, and also some of the great, powerful women in our state continuing to serve. So I don't think it's dissuading them, but it certainly is on our minds as we are thinking about, how are we going to keep our families safe as we are running for elected office? MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, we'll be watching as you transition into being the next Governor of New Jersey. Thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",left
"The Irish economy is expected “to grow exceptionally” this year amid the front-loading of exports into the US ahead of tariffs. In its latest set of autumn forecasts, the European Commission predicted the economy here would expand by 10.7 per cent in gross domestic product (GDP) terms in 2025, eight times the 1.3 per cent rate projected for the euro area overall. The EU’s executive arm said the forecast, which tallies with the Department of Finance’s own prediction, reflected “strong export activity in the first half of the year”. However, as the front-loading effect unwinds, growth here is expected to moderate to 0.2 per cent in 2026, “reflecting a technical base effect from 2025 dynamics, before stabilising at 2.9 per cent in 2027,” it said. READ MORE Irish goods exports to the US rose by 153 per cent to €71 billion between January and May as companies rushed to get product into the US market ahead tariffs. The Commission noted that real GDP here rose by 18.5 per ent in the first half of 2025, “driven by pharmaceutical exports to the US, likely reflecting front-loading in anticipation of US tariffs”. “The domestic economy also performed robustly, supported by strong private consumption and growth in modified investment (which excludes the more volatile intangible and aircraft leasing components),” it said. The Commission said the recent EU-US trade agreement helped ease tariff-related uncertainty. “While the impact of the US tariffs will vary across sectors, the overall effect on Ireland’s exports is expected to be limited, as its main goods exports to the US – notably pharmaceuticals – are not currently subject to these measures,” it said. On the public finances, the Commission predicted a budget surplus of 1.5 per cent “strongly supported by a buoyant growth in corporate tax revenues”. It said corporation income tax was set to be boosted by around €3 billion from 2026 onwards, as Ireland’s domestic top-up tax applying a minimum effective tax rate of 15 per cent for large corporate groups “is foreseen to start generating receipts”. “Bracket creep will strengthen personal income tax revenue thanks to a continued growth in wages, while a slowdown is expected for VAT receipts as a range of reduced VAT rates are to enter into force in 2026,” it said. The Commission cautioned that spending growth was set to outpace the growth in revenues “due to strong increases in permanent spending announced in the budget for 2026.” “This includes public sector pay, social welfare payments and capital investment, the latter supported by the revised National Development Plan envelope,” it said. Brussels also warned about the risk to the public finances from changes to the international trading environment and amplified by the concentration of revenue around a handful of firms. “The vulnerability of Ireland’s public finances to international developments, such as shifting US trade and tax policies or the global tax rules, remains the key risk exacerbated by the significant concentration of revenues in few pharmaceutical and ICT companies,” it said. On the wider euro zone economy, the Commission predicted the euro area economy would maintain its moderate expansion after weathering US president Donald Trump’s tariff turmoil better than expected. Output will rise 1.3 per cent in 2025, 1.2 per cent in 2026 and 1.4 per cent in 2027, it said. That’s an upgrade for this year compared with May’s prediction, and a small downgrade for 2026. Inflation is seen at 2.1 per cent in 2025, as previously forecast, and should stick close to the European Central Bank’s 2 per cent target over the next two years. Officials cautioned, however, that the 2027 figure, which matches that goal, includes an upward effect from a new carbon-pricing system that governments and lawmakers want to postpone. “Even in an adverse environment, the EU’s economy has continued to grow,” Economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said. “Now, given the challenging external context, the EU must take resolute action to unlock domestic growth.” Additional reporting by Bloomberg",left
"To paraphrase a perennial Washington question: What is the president going to release and when is he going to release it? Donald Trump is reeling from a spectacular defeat, easily his worst from his own party on Capitol Hill during two turbulent presidencies, after every step he took to stall and deflect the Jeffrey Epstein saga blew up in his face. No one would have believed as recently as this past weekend that a bill requiring the Justice Department to release files related to the convicted sex offender would race through the GOP Congress with only one vote against it by Tuesday evening. But such can be the power of suddenly unleashed political justice. Now, Trump and his Attorney General Pam Bondi, who both triggered the political uproar by pledging to open the Epstein files, only to then refuse to do so, are back where they started. Only in a much more vulnerable political position. And they have unappetizing political choices at a moment when Trump’s presidency appears damaged, his popularity is falling and a crush of other intractable issues bogs down his White House. Speculation is growing about whether a president who many were recently warning was a dictator is close to becoming a lame duck. Vindication for victims The overwhelming House and Senate moves to release the Epstein files are a stunning triumph for Epstein’s victims after they became more visible earlier this summer. A president who believes he enjoys unfettered power and who disdains democracy was defeated by grassroots political campaigning in combination with a handful of courageous lawmakers from both parties. But Haley Robson, a survivor of Epstein’s abuse, told CNN’s Erin Burnett that Tuesday’s moves were not the end for women who long ago lost trust the government would protect them. “We have to be very honest with ourselves. … We do have a long road in front of us,” she said. But the pressure of the survivors’ campaign now threatens to bear down on Trump alone, after the House and the Senate moved with extraordinary speed to dump a radioactive political issue on the White House. Their pace might at least momentarily weigh on the mind of a president who was twice saved from conviction in an impeachment trial by pliant Republican senators. In one of the most startling developments, House Speaker Mike Johnson, who’d long opposed the bill before Trump’s reversal, insisted the Senate must make changes to the bill. But senators ignored him and passed it up to the White House in an instant. Unless Trump and Bondi release the Epstein files immediately, the question that’s been haunting Trump for months will now become even more acute: What is he hiding? A bid by the DOJ to play for time — perhaps by arguing documents cannot be released because of ongoing investigations — might obstruct the hopes of survivors. But it might also mean Trump never escapes a storm that, judging by his eruptions at reporters, is driving him to distraction. Another DOJ strategy could be to release countless pages of Epstein files but with details, names and other information blacked out to avoid incriminating people. But that would only prolong the controversy. There’s been no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump in relation to his former friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in prison in 2019. Trump again branded the drama a Democratic “hoax” on Tuesday. But multiple mentions of the president in emails sent by Epstein recently released by Congress raise the possibility that he’s also referenced in documents held by the DOJ. One option for Bondi could be a vast document dump that casts suspicion on multiple prominent men who victims say maintained ties to Epstein in the hope that any minor mentions of Trump might be swept away in a deluge of scandal. But as president, he’s under the harshest spotlight and would be sure to attract the most interest, even though he has said he always knew Epstein was a creep. Of course, Trump has turned his DOJ into an arm of his political movement. So it would not be a surprise to see partial disclosures that do not satisfy his critics. But such is the intrigue around the drama, that there is no guarantee people would believe that he’d released everything. And conspiracists who’ve obsessed about the Epstein issue will never be satisfied. “The next question is, will Trump use some other maneuvers in an effort to deny the information to the public that’s required by the statute?” Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch said Tuesday. “We’ll see, but I don’t trust Trump on that.” Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, who broke with Trump to force through the bill demanding the release of the Epstein files, warned after the vote that he would act if there was an attempt to thwart disclosure of the Epstein evidence. As a last resort, he said, he might read aloud the names of alleged associates of the accused sex trafficker in the House. But he added that was only “if we hit all of the walls — but so far, we’re making it through the walls and over the walls, and we’re getting this done.” What wider damage has Trump sustained? Beyond the difficulty of next steps for Trump, there are the questions of how much political damage he’s suffered in recent days, both within his own party and personal power base and in the country more broadly. Ever since returning to the White House, Trump has wielded massive power through dominance, or at least the perception that he’s all-powerful. He never followed his party; it followed him. But the myth of total power was shattered on Sunday night when he reversed his adamant position that the House should block the attempt to release the Epstein files. The flip-flop was an attempt to defuse a looming political loss. But if his myth of omnipotence frays, it’s likely only to encourage further challenges to his authority. Of course, Trump’s instinct might be to lash out with constitutionally questionable conduct. This is an unusual moment for Trump. Could it presage a new phase of his presidency where the GOP does not move in lockstep on his orders? Or is the Epstein issue — which, at least to begin with, was disproportionately important to the conservative base — a one-off? One test might come soon for Trump over whether GOP lawmakers revolt over another matter: the expiration of enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which triggered the government shutdown. Some GOP lawmakers want to compromise with Democrats on the issue, but the president reiterated on Tuesday that he opposed any solution that sends more money to insurance firms. The US political calendar is relentless. And following larger-than-expected victories by Democrats in governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey this month, Republicans are wary about midterm elections next year. And onetime Trump ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s recent attacks on Trump’s globetrotting and lack of empathy over high prices suggest that frustration with him cuts deeper than Epstein alone. Yet Trump is a survivor, and not just of two assassination attempts. He pulled off the greatest political comeback in history in 2024 despite a criminal conviction and after leaving power in disgrace in 2021 after refusing to accept the results of an election. No modern president has ever had such an unshakable connection with his base. Still, Trump’s most potent political strategy has been to claim he’s been persecuted. That’s not an approach that seems likely to work as he’s faced with victims of Epstein offering their testimony in public. Trump’s rough patch Stunning developments on the Epstein files are not happening in isolation. It’s been a terrible few weeks for Trump. His polling numbers have slumped, especially over his handling of the economy. In another potential blow to his aura of invincibility, a federal judge this week raised grave questions about the viability of the DOJ’s prosecution of one of his enemies, former FBI Director James Comey. The Supreme Court recently seemed skeptical about Trump’s tariff policy ahead of a seismic pending ruling on presidential authority. And a federal court on Tuesday blocked Texas from using new congressional maps drawn at the president’s behest to aid the GOP’s bid to hold on to its House majority in next year’s elections. (Texas plans to appeal to the US Supreme Court.) This leaves Trump needing a political rebound — a tough ask for a White House organized on the principle of the president’s infallibility and for a commander in chief who will be 80 on his next birthday. It’s possible Trump no longer controls his own political fate. Presidents often get overtaken by events in second terms — most recently George W. Bush, whose political capital was consumed by the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina. And the symbolic might of Epstein’s long-overlooked victims has the look of a political force with unstoppable momentum. Epstein’s death deprived many of his victims of justice. But on Tuesday, Jess Michaels, an Epstein survivor, spoke about watching House members add their votes to a 427-1 victory that she told CNN’s Jake Tapper represented a commitment not to “stay silent about powerful predators.” There’s no evidence of criminal conduct by Trump. But his handling of the Epstein crisis now threatens to consume his presidency.",left
"Transcript: Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,"" Nov. 9, 2025 The following is the transcript of the interview with Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, that aired on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" on Nov. 9, 2025. MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin this morning with the Director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. This is now the longest shutdown in American history. The treasury secretary told us two weeks ago November 15 was the hard stop for any paychecks going to US troops. Does that remain the point of exhaustion? KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Right, I think that- that's about the right number. And the problem is that under the law, we're not allowed to spend money that hasn't been appropriated. And there is a law, the Antideficiency Act, that says that if a government official spends money that isn't appropriated by Congress, which will only happen if the Democrats vote to open up the government, then you could even have criminal penalties. And so people are very carefully studying the law and trying to get as much money out the door as is legal. And we're very glad that we found a way to get a lot of the SNAP money out, but it's really pushing the boundaries of the law, which is why the Supreme Court had to take that ruling from Rhode Island and put it on hold. MARGARET BRENNAN: Until the lower court rules-- HASSETT: Until the lower court goes back and comes up with a legal justification for what they said, because there probably isn't one, sadly, which is why we have to get this government open. I mean, the fact is Goldman Sachs, they have a top economic team, and they're estimating that we've already knocked about 1.5% off of GDP. I think that number is probably low if we keep going even a couple more weeks, because there's going to be a massive amount of air disruption, especially around the holidays. And one of these things every now and then when we're talking economics, you and I, we talk about seasonal adjustments and things like that. But the fact is that Thanksgiving, that Thanksgiving time, is one of the hottest times of the year for the economy. It's Black Friday, you know, and all that kind of stuff. And if people aren't traveling at that moment, then we really could be looking at a negative quarter for the fourth quarter. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is significantly disruptive to the president's agenda. But to the point you were just making about food stamps, and we saw this Friday, a temporary stay by the Supreme Court that would block full food stamp benefits pending the lower court decision. The administration's argument, as you just referenced there, was that it would be illegal to move around funding and to tap the Section 32 account at the USDA. But why not do this as a short term patchwork solution? Because you have found ways with the military pay to stretch things out. Why prioritize in that case and not do so with food? HASSETT: Well, the president's job, and all of our jobs, is to uphold the law. And when- I'm not a lawyer, but when the lawyers tell us-- [CROSSTALK STARTS] MARGARET BRENNAN: But are-- HASSETT: what we can do-- MARGARET BRENNAN: -- that wasn't done with the military. HASSETT: But, but, but yeah, I think that the military is different because of the commander-in-chief stuff. But the legal analysis suggests that we're doing everything by the book, and then stretching things as much as we can, and basically trying to keep people from committing crimes. Which you know, you know about- in the season of lawfare, if you are a cabinet secretary and you spend money that's not appropriated for that purpose in your cabinet, then they can come back and they can take you to court. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're also making a political bet that Democrats aren't going to challenge paying the military. Do you really think Democrats would challenge and take to court paying people for their food stamp benefits? HASSETT: Let's just say that we've seen Democrats-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --if, if Congress is going to fund it, when the shut- shutdown ends? HASSETT: We- we've seen Democrats take to court people that- on really, really poor charges, and so I think they're likely to do anything. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it seems a political calculation is the point. HASSETT: Well, we, we don't have a political calculation. Our calculation is to get the government open, to get the food stamps to people, and to get people to be paid, 750,000 government workers aren't getting paid right now. I know you're talking to the Governor of Maryland in a minute. I'm sure his people are really hurting. Let's just get the government open, and then let's talk about things like the healthcare premiums, but do that through regular order. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it sounds like you are saying the position is the same, open the government, then we'll talk about healthcare. But the president, just in the past 36 hours, has put out a number of social media posts. It sounds sort of like he's proposing something in regard to health insurance payments. He said, I'm recommended- to Senate Republicans that hundreds of billions of dollars currently being sent to money-sucking insurance companies to save bad healthcare provided by Obamacare now be sent to the people so they can purchase their own much better healthcare. He also said they should terminate Obamacare. What does this alternative system look like? Because the entire standoff is about healthcare right now. HASSETT: Right. Well, the president is, you know, a beautiful tactician, a beautiful negotiator-- MARGARET BRENNAN: This is an off-- HASSETT: --And this is- you know, what he said, he's brainstorming and trying to help the Senate come up with a deal that can get the government open. And one of the things you could do is conservatives believe that they don't want the government to micromanage people's lives. And you know, everybody believes that people should have healthcare, and so why not take the people who have higher healthcare premiums and just mail them a check and let them decide? The reason why it could have an effect is that there are multiple tiers under the Affordable Care Act of different types of insurance, and it could be that people would rather have the money and go from like, you know, this kind of plan to that kind of plan and save themselves a little bit. And so that's, that's, you know, basically giving the people an opportunity to make more choices than the government usually lets them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the Senator Cassidy proposal? HASSETT: I'm sure that Senator Cassidy and President Trump talked about it, but whether he agrees with everything that Cassidy- I haven't talked to him about it yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, does the Republican leader in the Senate accept-- HASSETT: --The president-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --this proposal?-- HASSETT: -- the president started this idea yesterday, I don't think that it's been discussed widely in the Senate yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president-- HASSETT: It's the weekend. MARGARET BRENNAN: --The Senate's in session this weekend-- HASSETT: --Yes, the Senate is in session this weekend and we are-- MARGARET BRENNAN: because they're trying to end the shutdown-- HASSETT: --And here I am. MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is not the Republican Party's position. HASSETT: As of right now, it's not the Senate position, but the president thought it was something they should think about. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he seems to be negotiating before the government's open. HASSETT: He's talking to his colleagues in the Senate on the Republican side. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would agree that there does need to be a deal on healthcare, that healthcare costs are too high. HASSETT: Well, I think that if you look at the Affordable Care Act, these premiums weren't made permanent by the Democrats during the COVID emergency because they're worried about the budgetary costs. And so if you look at the premium increases, they don't affect most people below two times the poverty line, three times the poverty line. But there are a lot of senior citizens that are above, like, around four times the poverty level, which with a husband and wife team would be about 120,000, that are seeing really big premium increases. And I think that everybody's going to want to think about what the next step for that would be, because are seeing- again most people aren't seeing much of an increase at all, but the maximum increases you're seeing could be up to about $500 a month for seniors who have really costly plans. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has also been talking about affordability, and our CBS polling shows the president's approval rating on the economy has dipped to 38%, the lowest of this term. 75% of those polled say he's not focusing enough on lowering prices, but the president said this week Democrats are making it up and quote, ""every price is down."" I'm sure you know the Consumer Price Index showed grocery prices are up nearly 3%, in September from a year ago. HASSETT: --well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Do you dispute that? HASSETT: Well, actually, let's go through the facts, right? Inflation went up about 5% under President Biden. In President Trump's first eight or nine months, depending where we get the last number, it's up 2.7%. One of the big things that's hurting affordability is mortgages. The interest rate went up by about 4%. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is grocery prices-- HASSETT: --No, grocery prices are actually down significantly under Trump. But here's the thing-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --but depends on which-- HASSETT: Let me-- I'll just make a point. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. HASSETT: That if you look at the real reduction in spending power for Americans under Joe Biden, then it went down about $3,000 because we had up to 9% inflation, and then they went to the grocery store, they couldn't buy the things they're used to buying. The real spending power, adjusted for inflation, under President Trump has gone up about $1,200 so far this year. $1,200 is not $3,000, and so people are right to feel stretched, but we're making progress. And if you look at all the positive things about the economy, industrial production just about at an all time high, capital spending about at an all time high, GDP growth right now about 4%, then that shows that the income growth that we need to get more affordability is on the path to happening. And the bottom line is that the last Consumer Price Index surprised down. It was lower than expected, and it would have been even lower because there was a refinery shutdown that caused it to go slightly higher. So we see inflation under control and the economy booming, but we understand 100% why people are still hurting, because we haven't made up all the room that was lost under Joe Biden. MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you comfortable with 3% inflation? HASSETT: I'm comfortable with 2% inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: So no, you're not happy where things are now. HASSETT: Well, they got to go down a little bit more, but there- but the point is that inflation is like the Queen Mary, my friend Alan Greenspan used to say, so when you go from almost 4% that we had in January down to the mid twos, then that's a trajectory that usually has momentum. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the St. Louis Fed found tariffs account for half a percentage point of the annual inflation rate. How much do you think the tariffs are hiking prices? HASSETT: You know, there's a couple of papers out there that say that prices went up by between two tenths and five tenths. And the thing to remember, if those papers are true, is that that's a level adjust, because the tariff goes in, and then the tariff is just there, so it doesn't affect inflation in the future. It would be a one time level adjust. Our estimates at CEA are much closer to zero, and it's all based on modeling and assumptions about elasticities and things. But for the most part, the one way you can see it is you could look at the price of imported goods, and the price of imported goods, CEA put a report out, has actually been declining under tariffs. Because what happens is that the Chinese want to sell us lots of stuff, and there's a tariff, so they cut their prices so that they can still have a larger market share in the US. MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, always good to have you here. Of course, we have to leave it there for now. We'll be right back in a minute. Stay with us.",left

Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Epstein saga re-emerges as the House returns to Washington The House is set to vote to end the government shutdown this evening, but it was the Jeffrey Epstein saga that again took over the spotlight in Washington today. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released emails from Epstein, the late convicted sex offender, to his associate Ghislaine Maxwell and journalist Michael Wolff that referenced President Donald Trump, Megan Lebowitz reports. In one 2019 email, Epstein wrote in reference to Trump: “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” The top Democrat on the House committee, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, said in a statement that the released emails “raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.” In a Truth Social post, Trump called the Epstein story a “hoax” and accused Democrats of releasing the documents to distract from news about the government shutdown. He urged Republicans not to “fall into that trap.” Trump has long denied wrongdoing in connection with Epstein’s crimes, though he has acknowledged they crossed paths in the 1990s. A spokesperson for the GOP-led committee accused Democrats in a statement of aiming to “carelessly cherry-pick documents to generate click-bait that is not grounded in the facts.” Republicans on the panel later released what they say are 20,000 additional pages from Epstein’s estate, in which Trump is referenced repeatedly. Epstein vote: On top of the newly released emails, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., swore in Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., whom he had refused to seat when the House was out of town during the shutdown after her Sept. 23 special election victory. One of Grijalva’s first moves was to provide the 218th signature on a bipartisan discharge petition that would allow rank-and-file lawmakers to bypass Johnson and force a floor vote to release the Justice Department files from its Epstein investigation. The measure is expected to pass the House in the coming weeks, though it would face long odds in the Republican-led Senate. But it will keep the issue in the conversation when Trump and Johnson would rather shift the focus elsewhere. Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina were the four Republicans who signed the discharge petition. Shutdown vote: Meanwhile, the House plans to vote in the coming hours on legislation to reopen the government and bring a close to the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Democrats have taken plenty of heat from members of their party in the last few days for failing to secure an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies as part of the funding deal. But some Democrats see a silver lining in the 43-day standoff, Scott Wong, Ryan Nobles and Lillie Boudreaux report. The eight Senate Democrats who negotiated the bipartisan agreement said it protects federal workers who had been laid off during the shutdown — at least temporarily. More importantly, they said, the showdown “crystallized” the battle lines in the next major political fight over health care that is sure to spill into the 2026 midterm elections. And they said it painted the White House in a negative light on the issue of food stamps. One other issue that has caused bipartisan consternation: a provision that was tucked into the funding package would allow senators to sue the federal government for potentially millions of dollars if their data is obtained without their notification. That would uniquely benefit eight Republican senators who were recently found to have had their phone records — but not the contents of their calls or messages — accessed as a part of the investigation that led to former special counsel Jack Smith’s probe of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Frank Thorp V notes. Johnson said House Republicans will introduce a stand-alone bill to repeal the provision. U.S policy dominates behind-the-scenes talk at G7 meeting By Andrea Mitchell Niagara Falls may be an iconic romantic setting, but romance was not in the air today for diplomatic leaders of the world’s major economic powers. At a meeting of G7 foreign ministers on Canada’s side of the falls, Canada announced more sanctions on Russia, while Britain called for more support for Ukraine as Russia bombards its critical energy infrastructure. But all the talk behind the scenes was about how to deal with the biggest power of them all: the United States.Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s foreign affairs and security representative at the G7 meeting, told NBC News in an interview that the ministers have discussed an issue that wasn’t on the official agenda: the legality of the U.S. strikes against ships in the Caribbean. Kallas said there are two justifications under international law for such strikes: self-defense or under the authority of a United Nations resolution. Since neither of those conditions would justify the U.S. military operation, she said, “looking forward,” the ministers are discussing changing international law because “the countries are all struggling” with the drug gangs. “It affects us all.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio told me that the ministers did not raise the strikes with him directly at the G7 meeting while defending the administration’s moves. “I don’t think that the European Union gets to determine what international law is. What they certainly don’t get to determine is how the United States defends its national security, Rubio said. “The United States is under attack from organized criminal narco-terrorists in our hemisphere, and the president is responding in the defense of our country.” Kallas also said in the past they could “follow the money” to get at the cartels, but that the rise of cryptocurrency has made that more difficult. She did not disagree when it was noted that the Trump administration’s endorsement of crypto has led to its growing legitimacy in international finance. And she said they have discussed the importance of freedom of navigation in international waters. Another point of contention at the G7 was trade. Canada took steps to hedge its bets on trade because of the Trump administration’s erratic tariff policy by inviting India, Brazil and other countries to attend today’s meeting, hoping to broaden its trading relationships beyond its closest neighbor. 🗞️ Today's other top stories - ☕ Cost concerns: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that “substantial” tariff relief for a number of everyday consumer items like coffee and fruit would be announced shortly.

"President Donald Trump keeps saying beef is the only grocery product that has gotten more expensive during his second presidency. âGroceries are down except for the beef, which Iâll get down too,â he said in a speech last week in Tokyo. âGroceries are way down, other than beef,â he said in a Fox News interview on Wednesday. â(Grocery prices) went up under Biden. Right now, theyâre going down. Other than beef, which weâre working on, which we can solve very quickly,â he said in a CBS interview taped last week. âWe have much lower prices than (Democrats) do, and we only have one thing, beef,â he said at the White House on Thursday. Trumpâs claim that grocery prices are down is wrong. And so is his claim that beef is the only grocery product that has increased in price. Grocery prices are up, not down. Grocery prices have increased during Trumpâs second term. Average US grocery prices in September were 1.4% higher than they were in January, the month he returned to office, and 2.7% higher than they were in September 2024 under former President Joe Biden, Consumer Price Index figures show. The 0.6% increase in average grocery prices from July 2025 to August 2025 was the biggest month-to-month jump in three years, and it was followed by a 0.3% increase from August to September. Itâs not just beef â not even close. The prices of dozens of grocery products increased from January to September. A smattering of products got cheaper, notably including eggs, but a far greater number of products got more expensive. You can see the long list of increases in the graphic below. âThe presidentâs claims about grocery prices donât align with the governmentâs own data,â Michigan State University professorâ¯David Ortega, a food economist, said in a Thursday email. He added, âWhile itâs true that beef prices have risen to record highs, theyâre far from the only category seeing increases. â¦ The reality is that prices for many everyday grocery items have increased in recent months, and tariff-related cost increases are now feeding through to consumers.â Prices increased from January to September in five of the six overarching groups of grocery prices tracked by the federal governmentâs Consumer Price Index: meats, poultry, fish, and eggs (up 4.5%); nonalcoholic beverages and beverage materials (up 2.8%); cereals and bakery products (up 1.4%); fruits and vegetables (up 1.3%); and âother food at homeâ (up 0.8%). Only the dairy and related products group was down, declining 0.2%. Grocery prices, like overall prices, tend to rise over time, and they can bounce around for all sorts of reasons unrelated to the actions of the president. But experts like Ortega say two of Trumpâs signature policies have clearly contributed to this yearâs increases: large and broad tariffs on imported goods (including food and food packaging materials) and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants (who make up a large percentage of the US farm workforce). The price of uncooked ground beef was up 14.2% between January and September. There was an even bigger increase, 15.3%, in the price of coffee; coffee consumed in the US is almost entirely imported, and much of it is now hit with big tariffs. Bananas, another product that is almost entirely imported in the US and now faces substantial tariffs, saw a 7.9% spike since January. Below is a list of the January-to-September changes in the price of 56 grocery products or product categories tracked by the Consumer Price Index.",left

"President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order exempting a range of food imports — including coffee, beef and bananas — from his reciprocal tariff policies. The White House said the president had “determined that certain agricultural products shall no longer be subject to the reciprocal tariffs.” Among the items being exempted are coffee, tea, tropical fruits, fruit juices, cocoa, oranges and tomatoes, the White House said. The rollback comes amid nationwide complaints of high grocery prices, despite Trump’s campaign pledge to lower prices. White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement Friday that Trump had detailed potential tariff modifications in a Sept. 5 executive order that “specifically laid out various natural resources and agricultural products not produced in the United States that could be eligible for tariff-free treatment.” “Exemptions are accordingly set to be granted following a spate of new trade deals being inked with some of our biggest allies in the western hemisphere, in addition to the deals that President Trump has already secured with the EU, Japan, the UK, and other major trading partners,” Desai said. Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement the administration is “finally admitting publicly what we’ve all known from the start: Trump’s Trade War is hiking costs on people.” He said the administration is putting “out a fire they started and claiming it as progress.” In a statement Friday, Chris Swonger, the president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States — the industry’s national trade organization — criticized the administration’s decision to leave distilled spirits from the European Union and the United Kingdom off the list. He described it as “yet another blow to the U.S. hospitality industry just as the critical holiday season kicks into high gear.” “EU and UK spirits, including Scotch, Cognac, and Irish Whiskey, are value-added agricultural products that cannot be produced in the United States,” Swonger said. Trump’s order comes a little more than a week after Democrats defeated Republican gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey. NBC News polling showed that the vast majority of voters — about two-thirds — think Trump hasn’t lived up to his promises to curb inflation and improve the economy.",left
"President Donald Trump delivered a speech on the economy to business leaders in Miami on Wednesday, one day after Republicans suffered brutal election losses in states where exit polls showed voters deeply concerned about financial issues. While the president has started to acknowledge that economic anxiety — including over the government shutdown — is hurting Republicans politically, his address to the American Business Forum largely hyped his economic agenda. “This is the golden age of America,” Trump said opening his campaign-style remarks, which even featured the song ""Y.M.C.A."" — a staple of his election rallies. Trump focused much of his time on what he views as three positive economic indicators: the stock market hitting record highs, wages ticking up and an easier environment for American-born workers to find jobs. “Almost 2 million American-born workers are employed today more than when I took office,” Trump said. Trump also said any economic slump is due to a ""transition period"" needed for his economic policies to really take hold, and — without evidence — boasted that there has been $18 trillion in investment made in the country since he returned to office, a number that has been debunked in the past. Trump's speech, however, frequently weaved away from the economy. He returned to attacks against his political opponents, going after former President Joe Biden for using an autopen and the new presidential library of former President Barack Obama, and he tried out nicknames for Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, saying he should be called ""Slimy Newscum."" Trump’s upbeat remarks at the Miami event largely did not reflect the increasingly difficult economic and political environment for his party. On Tuesday night, Democrats swept almost every high-profile race across the country during off-year elections seen as a testing ground for the 2026 midterms, when Republicans will try to hold onto slim majorities in the House and Senate. Though Trump did not put much direct effort into any of the races, his shadow loomed large over polling places across the country. Exit polling data showed that in each of the four states with significant elections — Virginia, New York, California and New Jersey — at least 55% of voters said they “disapprove” of Trump’s performance during his first 100 days in office. It’s the latest in a flurry of data that show much of that disapproval is tied to the economy, which Trump has tried to rewire with his across-the-board tariffs and a more than $4-trillion tax cut package. An NBC News poll released on Sunday showed that just 34% of voters think he has “lived up” to expectations on the economy, while 52% blamed Trump and Republicans in Congress for the government shutdown, which has gone on for 36 days and is now the longest in the nation’s history. The legality of Trump’s unilaterally imposed tariff regime was also the subject of a much-awaited Supreme Court hearing Wednesday, where administration attorneys were greeted by justices who seemed skeptical of arguments that Trump had the legal authority to impose sweeping tariffs under a federal law designed for national emergencies. Chief Justice John Roberts said that the tariffs amount to a tax — an argument the administration has vocally rejected — and said the power of taxation is the responsibility of Congress. Ahead of Wednesday's hearing, attorneys for the federal government argued that the Trump-imposed tariffs would “generate between $2.3 trillion and $3.3 trillion.” But when pressed during the hearing, Solicitor General D. John Sauer seemingly contradicted that argument, telling justices that they were not designed to raise revenue but rather “regulatory tariffs” designed to help Trump cut trade deals. If the court rules that Trump did not act lawfully when he unilaterally imposed the tariffs, it could spin off even further economic uncertainty. Trump does appear to finally be sensing some political trouble, showing a rare bit of reflection during a breakfast Wednesday morning with Republican senators. Trump acknowledged that the government shutdown is being blamed on Republicans more than Democrats, and said his party, which controls both the House and Senate, needs to reopen the government or face further political backlash. He also appeared to express some concern that ""countless public servants are now not being paid, and the air traffic control system is under increasing strain"" — a notable shift in rhetoric from his frequent criticisms and digs at federal workers, whom his administration targeted for layoffs and suggested might not be entitled to post-shutdown pay. Trump has been pushing senators to pursue the ""nuclear option"" of scrapping the legislative filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes to pass most legislation out of that chamber. Lawmakers have so far rejected that drastic measure. “If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans,” Trump said Wednesday morning. “Last night, it was not expected to be a victory, it was a very Democrat areas. I don’t think it was good for Republicans. I don’t think it was good for anybody. We had an interesting evening and learned a lot.” “We have to get the country open,” he added. Vice President JD Vance wrote on social media Wednesday that it was ""idiotic"" to read too much into Tuesday's election losses, since the contests took place in blue-leaning states. But even he admitted Republicans need to do more on the economy and said the outcome will be critical to the party's future in the midterms. ""The president has done a lot that has already paid off in lower interest rates and lower inflation, but we inherited a disaster from Joe Biden and Rome wasn't built in a day,"" he said. ""We're going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that's the metric by which we'll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond.""",left

"GE Appliances bolsters ties with US suppliers as it moves production from China to Kentucky GE Appliances says it has awarded more than $150 million in new contracts to U.S. suppliers as a result of its decision to shift production from China to Kentucky LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- GE Appliances on Thursday touted wide-ranging ripple effects from shifting production from China to Kentucky as it announced more than $150 million in new contracts awarded to U.S.-based suppliers. The supplier contracts range in value from $330,000 to $41 million, span 10 states and cover crucial segments of the supplier chain for the appliance maker's washer and dryer production — from plastics and castings to steel and aluminum, the company said. The suppliers range in size from U.S. Steel to family-owned companies. With the new contracts, GE Appliances said it is increasing domestic spending on suppliers by 3.3%. The suppliers will support production of a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers, all of which GE Appliances is moving from China to its sprawling Louisville complex known as Appliance Park. The company says it's investing $490 million to retool a plant for the project, which will create 800 new jobs. Production is scheduled to begin in early 2027, it said, and will expand the total footprint devoted to clothes care production at Appliance Park to the equivalent of 33 football fields. “When we invest in U.S. manufacturing and our people, it drives growth far beyond our own walls,” Lee Lagomarcino, a GE Appliances vice president, said Thursday in a news release. “These new supplier contracts represent what ‘Built for America’ is all about — investing in U.S. manufacturing, creating more American jobs and building opportunity that multiplies.” The announcements come as President Donald Trump attempts to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes — tariffs — on foreign goods. The president recently said the U.S. would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20% to 10%. That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57% to 47%. The $150 million-plus in new supplier contracts reflects the amount GE Appliances will spend each year for shipments of parts, components and raw materials to produce the washers and dryers, it said. Contract values could increase if sales of the washers and dryers grow, the company said. GE Appliances said it spends $4.6 billion with more than 6,500 U.S. suppliers, a 69% increase in spending and a 58% rise in its number of suppliers since 2019. Its U.S. supply chain has grown for more than a decade, it said. ""While tariffs have certainly been a factor, there are also many other benefits such as shorter lead times, reduced transportation costs and the ability to collaborate with your supply chain to ultimately serve our customers better,” Lagomarcino said. The new contracts were awarded to businesses in Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Alabama and California, GE Appliances said. It awarded more than $40 million in contracts to suppliers in Kentucky, more than in any other state. The contracts are the first of many expected ripple effects from its broader, five-year, $3 billion commitment to strengthen its U.S. manufacturing, reshore certain production and create more than 1,000 jobs, the company said. GE Appliances announced plans in August to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico. The company also has manufacturing plants in South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Connecticut. The company is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.",left
"Tariffs have been Donald Trump's personal crusade. Now, a Supreme Court test Trump, who wanted to attend arguments, says it's the ""most important"" case ever. Back in April, President Donald Trump made his decadeslong view on tariffs the official policy of the United States by imposing sweeping levies on virtually all global trade partners. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will consider whether those tariffs are lawful and allowed to stand. Trump is calling it the ""most important"" case before the court in its history. In a sign of his personal stake in the issue, Trump had talked about going to watch the arguments himself, which would have likely made him the first sitting U.S. president to do so. But he reversed course on Sunday, saying he didn't want to cause a distraction by attending. “No, I don't think so, because I don't want to call a lot of attention to me. It's not about me, it's about our country,” he said. ""I wanted to go so badly, I just don't want to do anything to deflect the importance of that decision,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One as he returned to Washington from a weekend in Florida. The president has painted the outcome as existential to the country's future. ""Everybody uses tariffs on us. If I wasn't allowed to use tariffs on them, we would be a third rate -- we would be a third world nation,"" Trump said in an interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes"" that aired Sunday. Trump's yearslong push for tariffs turned reality When Trump unveiled his tariffs on April 2, a date he dubbed ""Liberation Day"" for the U.S., he described them as retribution for a grievance he's held since the 1980s when he was a Manhattan real estate developer. ""I've been talking about it for 40 years because I saw what was happening 40 years ago,"" Trump said. ""I'd be on a television show, I'd be talking about how we were being ripped off by these countries. I mean, nothing changes very much. The only thing that changed were the countries, but nothing really changes. It's why it's such an honor to be finally able to do this,"" Trump added. Trump that day declared trade deficits a national emergency as he hit nearly every country with a baseline 10% tariff rate and tougher, so-called ""reciprocal"" rates on countries he deemed as the worst trade offenders. Since then, the administration says it has raked in billions of dollars in revenue and Trump has touted various deals with the United Kingdom, European Union, Japan, South Korea and most recently China. But the tariff rollout led to economic uncertainty and concerns of price increases for American businesses and consumers. One recent estimate from the Yale Budget Lab said tariffs will cost U.S. households $1,700 per year. A new poll from ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos found more than 6 in 10 American disapprove of how Trump is handling tariffs and the economy overall. Tariffs central to economic agenda, but Trump uses them for more Trump said on ""60 Minutes"" that he believed the U.S. economy would ""go to hell"" if the Supreme Court struck down his tariffs, now the cornerstone of his entire economic agenda. But he has used tariffs for leverage not just in trade negotiations but in a number of foreign policy matters. Trump said the threat of tariffs helped him bring an end to international conflicts between Cambodia and Thailand, India and Pakistan and more. He's used them to pressure Mexico and China into pledging more action to curb the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Brazil over the country's prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, a hard-line conservative who was convicted of trying to overthrow democracy. Trump relied on the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose his tariffs, sidestepping Congress in the process. Trump on Sunday, during his ""60 Minutes"" interview, bemoaned it would take Congress too long to act if he didn't have the power to impose tariffs himself. ""You want that power. You want that executive power,"" CBS's Norah O'Donnell asked Trump. ""You need it to ru-- to protect our country. This is a national secure -- tariffs are national security,"" Trump said. It's the biggest-- I think it's one of the biggest decisions in the history of the Supreme Court,” he said.",left
"Ireland will be asking the Trump administration to lift trade tariffs on whiskey, medical devices and certain agricultural products, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Helen McEntee has said. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer are in Brussels to meet trade ministers from the EU’s 27 states on Monday, with European governments making ]their cases for import tariffs to be eased on a range of products and goods. Nearly four months after a tariff deal was agreed between US president Donald Trump and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, progress securing carve outs to the across-the-board import taxes on goods sold to the US has been slow. European negotiators will use the opportunity with Mr Lutnick and Mr Greer to ask for a range of products to be exempted from 15 per cent tariffs that have applied to all imports coming from the EU. Goods on the EU’s wish list include pasta, cheese, wines, whiskey and olive oil. READ MORE Speaking before the meeting on Monday, Ms McEntee said the Government would be pushing for key Irish industries to benefit from any possible tariff cut. “Ireland will be working hard, and we’ll be making the case, as I will be today, to make sure that medtech is very much part of that, to make sure that our whiskey industry and our agri food industry is part of that as well,” Ms McEntee said. The EU agreed to stomach tariffs of 15 per cent to prevent a fight with the Trump administration that many believed could have escalated into a hugely damaging trade war. Tariffs on pharmaceuticals, which account for a huge chunk of Irish transatlantic exports, would be capped at that 15 per cent rate. Despite repeated threats, Mr Trump has yet to levy tariffs on pharma products yet. As part of the one-sided tariff deal, the EU did secure commitments that certain products, such as aircraft, aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and cork products, would be exempt from import levies. The European Commission, the EU’s executive branch which represents the bloc in the trade talks, has been seeking to extend those tariff exemptions to cover a much broader range of goods and industries. “Our American friends are very much aware of where the European Union would like to see tariff reductions, or other changes,” one EU diplomat said in recent days. The meeting between the senior Trump administration officials and EU trade ministers was arranged to give both sides a better understanding of where the other was coming from. The discussion will take place over lunch, where the two sides will also cover steeper 50 per cent tariffs on steel imports, and their approach to China. Ms McEntee said at the time the EU-US tariff agreement was struck that it was clear there would be “space for further discussions on further areas of common interest”. The Government continued to stress pharmaceutical companies’ complex, interconnected supply chains were vital to what was an “important two way industry for both the US and the EU”, she said.",left
"The recent jump in Irish exports was driven almost entirely by pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and its two bestselling weight-loss drugs. In a report on the likely impact of US tariffs on corporation tax here, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) said the rapid increase in exports during the first five months of the year was down to a single product category: protein and peptide-based hormones, which are used in the manufacture of these drugs. US customs data showed all US imports of protein- and peptide-based hormones from Ireland during the period went to the state of Indiana. Eli Lilly is headquartered in Indiana where it has several large manufacturing sites. READ MORE The company produces the active ingredients for its two blockbuster weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, at its plant in Kinsale, Co Cork, before shipping these to the US for further development. Global sales of these medicines have surged in recent months. Last month the company upgraded its projected full-year earnings to $63 billion (€54.3 billion) this year, crediting the growing adoption of these drugs. Will Imagine’s big gamble double its customer base? Between January and May, Irish goods exports to the US surged by 153 per cent to €71 billion as firms rushed to get product into the US in advance of tariffs. Ifac said about $42.3 billion of this related to exports of protein- and peptide-based hormones. “This spike in exports likely reflects strong US demand for these medicines, along with stockpiling in the US ahead of potential tariff changes,” it said. In its report, Ifac assessed the threat to Ireland’s corporate tax base from US tariffs. It said about three-quarters of Ireland’s €29 billion corporate tax haul came from a handful of large US multinationals in the technology and manufacturing sectors, leaving the exchequer exposed to a sudden shift in activity or profitability. “For now, at least” most of Ireland’s big corporation taxpayers have not been directly affected by tariffs, it said. Despite recent warnings, the short-term outlook for tax receipts was positive, it said, with profits in the tech sector potentially benefiting from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and profits in the pharma sector being helped from increased demand for weight-loss and other medications. However, it warned this increased profitability could make corporation tax even more concentrated, which posed a risk to the State. “Corporation tax is a key part of Ireland’s public finances. But it’s also one of the most volatile and uncertain sources of revenue,” report author Brian Cronin said. “Our analysis shows that recent US policy changes haven’t yet had a major impact on Ireland’s biggest taxpayers. In fact, some of the changes may have temporarily boosted corporation tax receipts.” He said this could change quickly, though. “The US is trying to encourage more manufacturing at home and it’s also pushing to lower drug prices domestically. Both could reduce the corporation tax paid in Ireland,” he said. However, Mr Cronin said there were countervailing factors that could increase Ireland’s corporation tax. “These include the performance of blockbuster drugs whose active ingredients are made in Ireland. Profits in the tech sector are also rising, driven by advances in artificial intelligence and growing demand for their products and services,” he said.",left
"European shares fell to a one-month low Tuesday, sparked by worries about an overvalued tech sector and diminishing prospects of an imminent interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve.

NEW YORK Wall Street’s main indices were lower in early afternoon trading on concerns over lofty equity valuations and dimming prospects of a December interest rate cut, while investors awaited Nvidia’s earnings and key government data due later this week. Most heavyweight tech stocks were under pressure. Nvidia’s quarterly results, due after markets close on Wednesday, are seen as a litmus test for the AI-driven rally that has pushed markets to record highs this year. The AI chip giant’s shares were down. Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai told the BBC in an interview on Tuesday that no company would be unscathed if the AI boom collapses.

"The Trump administration plans to lower the United States’ tariffs on goods from Switzerland, according to an announcement Friday from the White House and the Swiss government following a meeting with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. The tariff rate the US charges on Swiss imports will fall to 15% from 39%, which had been among the highest levies the United States charges for any country’s goods. As part of the agreement, Swiss companies committed to investing “at least $200 billion into the United States, with at least $67 billion worth of investment occurring in 2026,” according to a White House fact sheet published on Friday. In a separate statement, the Swiss government said the total investments would be completed by 2028. It also said it agreed to lower tariffs on “a range of American products.” Additionally, tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors from Switzerland won’t exceed 15%, according to a joint statement. This comes as the Trump administration has been mulling higher tariffs on both sectors. “They’re going to send a lot of manufacturing here to United States — pharmaceuticals, gold smelting, railway equipment,” Greer said in a CNBC interview on Friday, previewing details of the agreement. Wristwatches, unsmelted gold and medical equipment are all among the top goods the United States buys from Switzerland. While gold had been excluded from the tariffs, wristwatches and medical equipment, as well as other Swiss exports, could get cheaper for Americans to buy. The United States ran a $38 billion trade deficit with Switzerland last year, according to US Commerce Department data. Greer said the agreement reached seeks to lower that. Before President Donald Trump’s second term, goods from Switzerland were generally charged a tariff of between 0% to 2.5%. “Although overall tariffs remain higher than before the additional tariffs were introduced in April, the agreed reduction in additional tariffs is expected to have a positive impact on the Swiss economy,” the Swiss government said.",left
"Are you missing a trick when it comes to smart meters? About two million of us have them installed in our homes, but data published this month shows many of us aren’t sure exactly what to do with them. The meters were installed by ESB Networks and we were told they would help us find cheaper electricity tariffs. But there seems to be an information gap about what happens next. Just having the meter itself won’t give you cheaper electricity, householders need to take further action to achieve that. And that’s the bit that’s missing. Almost six in ten of those with a smart meter are “unaware” they need to move to a smart meter price plan to get the benefit of it, according to Electric Ireland’s Sustainability Index, a nationally representative survey of one thousand people by Red C published this month. While 63 per cent of those surveyed said they have a smart meter, only three in five of those respondents said they had moved to a smart meter plan, according to the survey. READ MORE Irish households don’t seem to have made the link between having the meter and the potential it has to lower your bills. Until we do, these meters remain a piece of kit on a wall. So, how can your smart meter help you lower your bills? The meter keeps information about how and when your household uses most electricity. If your home heating, water heating, tumble dryer and dishwasher are usually going gangbusters at 6.30pm before slumping at 8pm, your meter logs this. This will allow you move some of your usage to a time of the day when electricity is cheaper, or use the data to switch to a price plan that better matches your usage, and you can lower your bills. First step: Set up smart meter account The first step to using your smart meter to find savings is to create an account at esbnetworks.ie. Once you’ve set up an account, or logged in, you’ll need your “MPRN” – this unique ID is located at the top of your bill. It’s a different number to your account number. Once you’ve created an account, you’ll have direct access to your usage data, as stored by your smart meter. You’ll see a breakdown of your electricity usage by day of the week, or at different times of the day – for example, “peak time” is 5pm to 7pm and “night time” is 11pm to 8am. By knowing how your household is using electricity, you can make more informed decisions about your consumption. Do you really need to start the dishwasher at 6pm, or could it wait until 9pm when you can pay less for the same thing? Some savings you can only achieve with behaviour changes – like swapping energy-guzzling tumble drying, dishwashing, water heating, or car charging, to lower cost times. On the right plan, doing this can save you a significant amount on your bills, without compromising on your comfort, says Electric Ireland. Second step: Use a comparison tool The second way you can save money is by uploading your smart meter data to one of the many free electricity plan comparison tools to find the cheapest tariff for your usage. With almost 60 tariffs available from a dozen energy suppliers, your meter data allows you to make an evidence-based decision. The Commission for Regulation of Utilities recommends using free price-comparison websites to shop around for the best plan. It approves bonkers.ie, switcher.ie, powertoswitch.ie and energyswitch.ie. There are other tariff comparison tools too, including ones from energypal.ie and kilowatt.ie, which is useful for EV and solar panel users. DCU’s Research Centre for Data Analytics offers a tool , and so too does UCD’s Energy Institute, in collaboration with the Sustainable Energy Authority Of Ireland. Step three: Find the right tariff The best tariff for you might be a smart tariff; a day/night rate, or a fixed 24-hour rate – you can use your individualised smart meter data to find out. If you have a smart meter, you can switch to a “time-of-use” tariff. This is where you pay different rates at different times of day. This differs from a traditional “flat” tariff, which charges the same rate at all times of day. With a time-of-use tariff, you will typically pay a higher rate for electricity during peak hours, like late afternoons and early evenings when people return from work and many businesses are still open. It costs more to provide electricity during these peak hours. You will pay a lower rate during offpeak hours, such as overnight – this is to encourage you to shift your energy consumption to times of lower demand. You could choose something like a “night” plan which provides ultra-low electricity rates while you are sleeping, making it ideal for electric vehicle owners, households with heat pumps or anyone able to shift their usage to offpeak times. Smart plans will be most beneficial to those who can shift usage to cheaper times. If you’re working from home and can put on a wash outside of peak hours, great. Step four: Enjoy the savings But will all of this really make a difference to your bills? Wholesale electricity prices fell by 18.5 per cent in October compared with the same period last year, data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) shows. The price was 74 per cent lower when compared with the peak that occurred in August 2022 in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It was, however, up 6.6 per cent compared with the previous month. While wholesale prices have eased considerably over the past 12 months, retail prices for consumers remain high. Flogas, SSE Airtricity, Bord Gáis Energy, Pinergy and Energia have all increased electricity prices by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent on average, which will add about €200 to the average annual bill for their customers. On the flip side, Yuno Energy, PrepayPower and Electric Ireland have announced they are freezing electricity prices for the next few months at least. Several thousand households have found a cheaper tariff by using its comparison tool, says DCU. The cheapest annual bill for users of the DCU tool averaged just under €1,600 while the most expensive averaged €2,750. That’s a difference of more than €1,150 a year for the same household, the same energy usage, just by choosing the wrong tariff, says DCU. There are other benefits to smart tariffs too. Time-of-use tariffs don’t just enable you to save money; moving to a cheaper, offpeak time also makes room for renewable power in our national grid, says the CRU. This cuts our CO2 emissions and lowers our reliance on fossil fuels. We’re not incurious about our electricity usage – eight in 10 households in Ireland say they are interested in receiving an annual review of their energy consumption, while seven in 10 want to get tips on how to reduce their usage, according to the Electric Ireland data. So next time your electricity contract is up for renewal, instead of blindly renewing, use your smart meter data to analyse your usage and find a better tariff. Let the recent cold snap focus your mind. If you do one thing to save money in 2026, use that piece of smart kit on your wall to get cheaper electricity.

"Editorial Roundup: United States Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad: ___ Nov. 19 The New York Times says the U.S. shouldn't provide cover for the misdeeds of our allies The realities of geopolitics have long required the United States to ally itself with foreign leaders who commit terrible deeds. Defeating foreign threats often requires the help of countries that fall far short of being liberal democracies that respect human rights. Saudi Arabia is a classic example of such a country today. It both has a disturbing human rights record and is a legitimately valuable American partner in countering Iran’s aggressions and building a more stable Middle East. But working with imperfect partners does not mean that the United States should cover up and lie about their misdeeds, as President Trump did when receiving Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, in the Oval Office on Tuesday. It was a fawning, cringe-worthy performance that belied America’s more powerful status. It was absolution rather than realpolitik. Mr. Trump embraced the prince’s implausible claim of innocence in the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen and journalist, and berated Mary Bruce, of ABC News, for asking about the killing. The C.I.A. has concluded that the crown prince almost certainly ordered the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a critic of the prince who was living in self-imposed exile in the United States and was murdered while visiting a Saudi consulate in Turkey. A United Nations investigator and a coalition of nongovernmental organizations reached similar conclusions. These inquiries noted that Saudi officials offered conflicting accounts of the killing and concealed information about it. Eventually, the kingdom investigated several members of Prince Mohammed’s inner circle for the killing. The president’s performance was alarming for three main reasons. One, it suggested that the truth was irrelevant, and it discarded the hard work of American intelligence in trying to determine that truth. It continued a long pattern of Mr. Trump lying when it suits his interests. Two, he whitewashed a brutal human-rights violation — a killing by strangulation, followed by the dismembering and disposal of the body, committed by a team of Saudi operatives. The United States does not have the power to rid the world of human-rights abuses. At its best, though, this country has successfully nudged allies toward better behavior. Mr. Trump, by contrast, signaled this week that foreign despots can eliminate bothersome critics without worry of American disapproval. Three, the president showed open disdain for the principles of press freedom enshrined in the Constitution. Traditionally, foreign leaders who visit the White House understand that they will not be able to avoid hard questions, as authoritarian leaders can at home. Ms. Bruce, the ABC correspondent, lived up to this tradition with a two-part question about the Trump family’s business dealings in Saudi Arabia and the prince’s role in Mr. Khashoggi’s killing. Mr. Trump unpersuasively waved away his conflicts of interest before demeaning Mr. Khashoggi — “a lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about” — and defending Prince Mohammed. “He knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,” Mr. Trump said. “You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.” The role of the news media in our democracy is not to flatter foreign leaders or, for that matter, American ones. It is to pose important and sometimes challenging questions and publish the facts. As president, Mr. Trump repeatedly shows contempt for this principle. Over the past week alone, he called Ms. Bruce “a terrible person” and told another female reporter, “Quiet, piggy.” His behavior suggests that he would prefer an American news media that behaves more like Saudi Arabia’s largely muzzled and obsequious media. The prince is a complicated dictator. He has pushed his country to become more modern and open in important ways, including by expanding women’s rights, reducing the influence of religious hard-liners and diversifying the economy. He also remains an authoritarian. In addition to evidently masterminding the savage killing of Mr. Khashoggi, he regularly jails critics and has overseen a sharp increase in executions for low-level drug offenses. The appropriate role for the United States is to make him uncomfortable about his abuses and push Saudi Arabia toward a freer future. ONLINE: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/opinion/saudi-mbs-trump-khashoggi.html ___ Nov. 24 The Washington Post says Trump's immigration policies are over the top The Trump administration has named New York City the next target in its deportation tour. White House border czar Tom Homan revealed last week he is planning a widespread dragnet across the Big Apple “in the near future,” in addition to enforcement sweeps already happening. The administration sees this as the obvious next step in its pressure campaign against “sanctuary” policies in blue cities and states. But these actions are not without cost. In fact, the administration’s mass deportation campaign is already backfiring. Securing the border and deporting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes are some of President Donald Trump’s most popular policies. The latter has support among 79 percent of Americans — including 69 percent of Democrats — in the latest Harvard-Harris poll. Despite this, approval for Trump’s immigration agenda has dropped nine points since February. The president’s over-the-top approach to deportations is almost certainly the reason why. While Homan has vowed to prioritize going after the “worst of the worst,” the administration has rounded up more than just hardened criminals. Americans can see the difference between carting off a rapist and deporting the neighborhood gardener who pays taxes. The Trump administration blames “collateral arrests” — picking up people who weren’t the target of an operation — on sanctuary policies. Todd M. Lyons, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has said they wouldn’t feel compelled to be so aggressive if localities willingly turned over “violent criminal aliens.” Lyons raised a valid public safety concern. Some progressive states and cities limit local law enforcements’ ability to honor ICE detainers, or requests for law enforcement to hold people past their release date, unless a serious crime has been committed. And some cities, such as New York, require a conviction for a serious crime or a judicial warrant. Sanctuary jurisdictions often argue that holding someone for a civil ICE detainer amounts to unlawful detention. This means that some migrants with criminal charges have been released back into the community in defiance of a detainer. It’s reasonable to debate how local law enforcement can cooperate with ICE to track down potentially dangerous criminals. But that isn’t an excuse for the government to round up just anyone, nor is it a particularly effective way to convince moderates to rethink sanctuary policies. “Bringing hell” to Boston, as Homan promised to cheers at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, hasn’t gotten Massachusetts to change its policy on honoring ICE detainers, but it did make Boston’s defiant mayor, Michelle Wu, a progressive hero. Some states, such as Colorado, have even strengthened their sanctuary laws since Trump took office. Meanwhile, mass deportations — and Trump’s broader anti-immigration policies — are threatening key industries like construction and agriculture. In October, Trump’s own Labor Department released a document that “the near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce” is disrupting production costs and “threatening the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers. ”For a moment, Trump seemed to understand this, briefly directing immigration officers in June to stop arresting agriculture and hospitality workers before reversing that policy a week later. New Yorkers have already been through a roller-coaster of immigration policies. In 2022, Republican governors in border states bused migrants to the city to test the sincerity of its sanctuary laws. In time, Mayor Eric Adams (D), once a defender of those laws, changed his tune. In April, his administration issued an executive order allowing ICE into New York’s Rikers Island prison complex to investigate transnational gang members, just days after federal prosecutors dismissed corruption charges against the mayor. His order was blocked in September by the New York State Supreme Court because of an “impermissible appearance of a conflict of interest.” At his chummy news conference with Trump on Friday, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said New York’s laws allow the city to coordinate with ICE on some serious crimes, but that these have “very little to do” with the deportation of women and children whose only crime is being in the country illegally. Some members of the Trump administration don’t care about that distinction, but the American people seem to. ___ Nov. 21 The Wall Street Journal on what Trump's latest peace offering means for Russia and Ukraine The Trump Administration is making another run at ending the war in Ukraine, and a lasting peace with honor would be a laudable achievement. But for three years the only peace on offer has been Ukraine’s surrender, and the latest American offer—really, an ultimatum—is merely another dressed-up version. The 28-point plan that was mooted in the press but became public on Thursday includes a reduction in Ukraine’s military and a cap on its manpower at 600,000, from about 900,000 now. It isn’t clear if foreign peace-keeping troops would be allowed on Ukraine’s soil or if it could maintain long-range weapons. The deal hands Mr. Putin all of the Donbas in the east. He’d pocket the territory he’s already seized there—and get the rest that Ukraine still holds despite nearly four years of Russian assaults. Ukraine would forfeit its right to join a defensive Western alliance in NATO. Oh—and the U.S. and Ukraine would recognize Russian control of Crimea, which Mr. Putin took by force in 2014. Mr. Putin has made these demands since 2022 after his failed storming of Kyiv. This managed capitulation would be a bitter pill in Ukraine. “Now is one of the most difficult moments in our history,” Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday. Ukraine must choose between “dignity, or the risk of losing a key partner.” That bracing remark underscores that Mr. Trump is essentially saying Ukraine must agree to his terms or he will stop U.S. weapons and intelligence support. Mr. Zelensky is in a weakened domestic position amid the embarrassment of a fresh corruption scandal in Kyiv. But after Mr. Putin’s brutalities, it will be hard for any Ukrainian patriot to sell this settlement to the Ukrainian public. Trump officials will say that Mr. Trump is for the first time offering an explicit U.S. security guarantee, albeit details unknown. The decision for Ukraine is whether to believe this guarantee. A parchment promise does not mean Mr. Putin has abandoned his designs to control Ukraine. For him it is an ideological and historical mission that is part of his legacy. “If Vladimir Putin lives up to a cease-fire or peace treaty with Ukraine,” as Sen. Roger Wicker put it this year, “it will be the first time ever.” Then there are the questions for the United States. Mr. Putin’s method is to push against red lines and probe the will of his opponents. Mr. Trump will have handed Mr. Putin favorable terrain in the east that helps the Russian make a direct run for Kyiv when he’s rearmed and ready. Mr. Trump’s offer would defang a fighting ally in Ukraine—the kind the Administration says it wants—and expose the U.S. to a greater risk of a direct confrontation with Russia. Where are the supposed realists and restrainers who run this Administration? We are supposed to believe that the same President who won’t sanction China for buying Russian oil and assisting its war machine will go to war for Kyiv? And assume for a moment that Mr. Trump is prepared to back up his promise to Ukraine with the lives of the men and women of the U.S. military. What about a President JD Vance or President Gavin Newsom? Also extraordinary is the offer to rescue and rehabilitate Mr. Putin financially. “Russia will be reintegrated into the global economy,” the document says, and return to make the G7 again the G8 group of nations. Russia would be the only dictatorship in that group. The U.S. will enter some “long-term economic cooperation agreement” with Russia, an outgrowth of the Trump delusion that Mr. Putin can be wooed with commerce. The plan floats working with Russia on—we are not making this up—artificial intelligence. Mr. Trump might as well skip the middle man and surrender the U.S. tech advantage to China directly. Mr. Trump insists the war in Ukraine is Europe’s problem, but then why not first consult those who live in Mr. Putin’s backyard? The deal looks like an echo of Trump’s first term freeze out of the Afghan government while Zalmay Khalilzad negotiated with the Taliban in Doha. That set the stage for President Biden’s abandonment of Afghanistan. Mr. Trump may figure he can finally wash his hands of Ukraine if Europe and Ukraine reject his offer. He’s clearly sick of dealing with the war. But appeasing Mr. Putin would haunt the rest of his Presidency. If Mr. Trump thinks American voters hate war, wait until he learns how much they hate dishonor. Mr. Trump can tarnish his legacy if he wants, but the bigger risk here is to the United States. A bad deal in Ukraine would broadcast to U.S. enemies that they can seize what they want with force or nuclear blackmail or by pressing on until America loses interest. The odds of a Pacific crisis will go up. European capitals and the last adults in Congress will now scramble to try to talk Mr. Trump off this plan—and don’t rule out Mr. Putin still overplaying his Trump hand. These are the forces that can save the U.S. President from appeasement he’ll regret. ___ Nov. 21 The St. Louis Post-Dispatch hope the GOPs defiance Trump on Epstein files is an indicator of things to come America doesn’t yet know, and will probably never know, what if any role Donald Trump played in Jeffrey Epstein’s sick world of child sex trafficking. Whatever this president says, there’s zero chance that his compliant Justice Department will allow anything damning or even unflattering about him to emerge when they finally release the long-awaited, heavily redacted Epstein files. What we have learned, however, is that Trump doesn’t always, in every instance, hold similar sway over the usually subservient Republicans who control Congress. On this issue, the GOP lapdogs rebelled, making clear they were ready to defy Trump’s resistance to releasing the files — to the point that he finally had to lurch to the head of that parade and pretend he was leading it, lest he get trampled by it. Which raises an encouraging question: If congressional Republicans can finally find the grit to actually carry out their duty of checking presidential power on this one issue, might there theoretically be others? After all, on topics ranging from tariffs to government service cuts to domestic militarization, Trump’s rogue policies are burdening their constituents in ways far more relevant than a dead pedophile. Epstein, of course, was the wealthy financier who hung himself in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors in New York and Florida. His long history of hobnobbing with powerful people — including Trump and former President Bill Clinton — made revelations of his twisted double life politically explosive. Trump himself helped light that fuse with his usual reckless conspiracy-mongering, such as retweeting an allegation shortly after Epstein’s death that Epstein “had information on Bill Clinton & now he’s dead.” It was largely Trump’s drumbeat on the issue, starting in his first presidential term, that convinced his MAGA movement to treat the release of the Epstein files as a holy quest. Which made it all the more interesting that, in his current term, Trump did an about-face and became the chief obstructionist to that crusade. This cannot be said emphatically enough: Through the entire Epstein saga this year, Trump has always had the authority to simply order all the Epstein records in the federal government’s possession released. Yet it took the recent action by Congress to force the issue. Before those bipartisan, nearly unanimous congressional votes in the past week, Trump and his people, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, had been trying to douse the issue, claiming (in a reversal of their own previous claims) that the much-speculated-upon Epstein “client list” of fellow pedophiles didn’t actually exist. It wasn’t the only suspicious movement by the administration. Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s imprisoned co-conspirator, was recently moved to a lighter-security facility, allegedly is getting preferential treatment there, and is reportedly preparing to petition Trump for clemency. At the same time, multiple media outlets have reported that the Justice Department has been scouring hundreds of thousands of Epstein documents on orders to redact any mention of Trump. Trump himself, with a typically ham-handed diversionary tactic, is again regurgitating unsupported claims that Clinton has been implicated. None of this should be taken as evidence of criminality by Trump. We all know his fragile ego and bottomless self-regard well enough to consider that he was merely trying to avoid embarrassing accounts of his time as an Epstein insider. In any case, Trump had lobbied for months to prevent congressional Republicans from taking up legislation to force release of the files, dismissing as a “Democrat hoax” the very conspiracies he used to promote. It was only when it became clear that congressional Republicans were on a path to defy him anyway and demand the files that Trump again pirouetted and publicly backed the legislation. He subsequently signed the bill sent to him. Again, we’re not holding our breath (and no one should) for evidence implicating Trump in Epstein’s crimes. If that evidence exists, it won’t see the light of day regardless of the legislation. This we know because we know Trump and we know his administration. But now we also know that congressional Republicans are, when properly motivated by public opinion, capable of pulling on their big-boy pants and doing their jobs. As Americans of every political persuasion watch their president driving up prices with spastic, rogue tariff policies, violating the Constitution left and right with unauthorized spending cuts and personal enrichment, scuttling due process and the rule of law, militarizing our streets, and threatening the American project in so many other ways — all while Congress generally sits by, whistling — here’s hoping they take this as a lesson in the politics of the possible. ONLINE: https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/article_03bc2585-d726-4947-a7d8-fb54f52dcc0f.html ___ Nov. 20 The Guardian on the destruction in Gaza The declaration of a ceasefire in Gaza in October brought initial relief to its inhabitants. Yet officials there said Israeli strikes killed 33 people, including 12 children, on Wednesday; Israel said its troops had come under fire. Another five Palestinians were killed on Thursday. Hundreds have died since the ceasefire was declared. Even if the shelling stops, the destruction of Palestinian life will carry on as Israel continues to throttle aid, and the consequences of two years of war unfold. The World Health Organization warned last month that the health catastrophe would last for generations. Food remains in short supply. While displaced families shiver in flooded makeshift shelters, with many facing a third winter of homelessness, aid organisations say they cannot deliver stockpiles of tents and tarpaulins. Israel, which denies blocking aid, has designated tent poles as “dual-use” items that could potentially be used for a military purpose. Save the Children reports children sleeping on bare ground in sewage-soaked clothing. The Guardian last week revealed US plans for the long-term division of Gaza into a “green zone” under Israeli and international control, to be redeveloped, and a “red zone” left in ruins; a US official described reunion of the strip as “aspirational”. This vision – with international troops essentially propping up Israeli occupation, and Palestinians drawn to those areas to escape squalor and chaos elsewhere – echoes disastrous US policies in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is the grim underpinning of the UN security council resolution this week, endorsing Donald Trump’s peace proposals. The “board of peace” looks like a colonial authority overseen by Mr Trump, and perhaps anchored by Tony Blair. Palestinian technocrats, somehow both domestically credible and acceptable to the US and Israel – a notable feat – would work beneath it. All this would be possible thanks to an international stabilisation force that the US hopes to see deployed by January. That would be a stretch even if countries prove truly willing to commit troops. The resolution improved on a draft text and won backing from the Arab world – and angry rejection from the Israeli right – by including references to a Palestinian state and Israeli withdrawal. Yet those references are couched in the vaguest terms, as an unguaranteed reward for sufficiently good behaviour, rather than as a recognition of inalienable Palestinian rights. If all goes according to plan, “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”. Israeli withdrawal would be based on standards and timeframes agreed by the military itself as well as the US and others. Countries have backed not what this text does mean but what it might conceivably mean or become. Some believe that this is the best that can be salvaged from current circumstances, given Mr Trump’s presidency; others hope that it is just possible that this unpromising start could allow something better to be forged. But it is hard not to conclude that for some governments, this is more about conscience-salving and reputation-laundering than the best interests of Palestinians. Germany has already announced that it will resume weapons exports to Israel. For Palestinians, “what looked like a forever war may be metamorphizing into forever misery”, the political scientist Nathan Brown has warned. Countries that were complicit in a genocidal war have all the more duty to demand better.",left
"The jury is still out on whether the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again this month amid conflicting reports about the state of the US economy. The debate in Europe and regarding the European Central Bank’s (ECB) next move is all but closed. Few expect Frankfurt to change from the current course when it meets later this month. “We’re in a good place,” ECB chief Christine Lagarde has said on several occasions recently, which is interpreted to mean inflation has stabilised at around 2 per cent, the bank’s target rate, and monetary policy will remain in a holding pattern until the data say different. Euro zone price data, published on Tuesday, are expected to show headline inflation for bloc remaining at close to 2 per cent in November. The final reading before the ECB meets on December 18th is expected to confirm the no-change bias. READ MORE That would leave policymakers able to focus instead on their pivotal quarterly forecasts, featuring the first outlook to stretch as far as 2028. There were mixed signals from national reports across Europe this week, with stronger-than-expected inflation in Germany and Spain contrasting with weaker-than-anticipated numbers for France and Italy. In the Republic, the harmonised index of consumer prices slipped more than 3 per cent for the first time in several months. But that hike owes as much to statistical base effects (year-on-year comparisons) as anything. The inflation outlook hinges on the impact of US tariffs, which has yet to play out. Some policymakers fear that the full extent of US tariffs is yet to be felt and that a strong euro will hurt exporters while pulling overall inflation below the ECB’s 2 per cent target. The recently released minutes of the ECB’s October meeting reveal increasingly divergent views on inflation risks. “Members assessed that the outlook for inflation continued to be more uncertain than usual on account of the still volatile global trade policy environment,” the minutes said, noting some members viewed inflation risks as tilted to the downside while others viewed it as tilted to the upside over the medium term. At the moment, markets are pricing no further interest rate cut in December.",left
"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday that ""substantial"" tariff relief for a number of everyday consumer items would be announced shortly. Bessent, speaking on Fox News Channel, said that while ""it's tough to do a lot of specific things,"" the administration would be moving to cut duties on a number of ""things that we don't grow here in the United States."" He indicated that coffee, bananas and other fruits would be among the items to see some import tax relief, but did not say how. ""That will bring prices down very quickly,"" Bessent told ""Fox and Friends."" President Donald Trump also promised tariff relief on coffee this week. ""Coffee, we're going to lower some tariffs,"" the president said Tuesday evening on Fox News. ""We're going to have some coffee come in."" ""We're going to take care of this stuff very quickly, very easily,"" Trump added. Bessent added on Wednesday that he expects ""the American people are going to start feeling better"" about inflation in the first or second quarter of 2026. Inflation in the U.S. has risen every month since April, when the president introduced his sweeping tariff agenda. In September it hit 3%. Brazil is the number one source of coffee imports for the U.S. according to USDA data. The countries that export the most bananas to the U.S. are Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Costa Rica. Trump hiked tariffs on Brazil to 50% in July, in part due to the legal case against his political ally, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump has also complained about how Brazilian courts treat U.S. tech companies. Between the higher duties and a drought in Brazil, coffee prices have surged. This year alone, coffee futures traded in New York have jumped around 20%. Over the last 12 months, that jump is nearly 45%. Speaking alongside Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Oct. 26, who has asked Trump to lower duties on his country, Trump said ""I think we'll make a deal with Brazil."" ""I think we'll probably come to a conclusion pretty quickly"" on lower tariffs, he added.",left
"Long-simmering tensions between President Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz are boiling over, with White House allies convinced that the Texas Republican is aiming to boost his 2028 presidential prospects at the expense of Vice President JD Vance. Cruz has raised hackles by positioning himself against Trump — and, by extension, Vance — on several key issues, three people with knowledge of the situation told NBC News. “Clearly everything Ted has been doing for the last year has been calculated with his eyes toward 2028,” a person close to the White House said, assessing Cruz’s motivations. The person, like others, was granted anonymity to speak candidly. “He’s doing this dance where he won’t say anything bad publicly about Trump or Vance specifically but he’s doing things to position himself to the right, and he’s not doing a good job concealing it,” they added. The irritation dates to the earliest days of Trump’s second term, when Cruz unsuccessfully sought unilateral subpoena power in his role as chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. The move would have given Cruz broad authority to bring administration officials and Big Tech executives friendly with Trump and Vance before his panel. In recent months, Cruz has clashed with the Trump administration over free speech issues and with Tucker Carlson, the influential conservative commentator with close ties to Vance. Three people granted anonymity to share details of private conversations say Cruz also opposed Vance and others who recommended Trump’s recent renomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. White House frustrations with Cruz were first reported by NOTUS. A Cruz spokesperson described the senator, who was runner-up to Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, as “the point of the spear” for advancing Trump’s agenda, noting among other initiatives Cruz’s sponsorship of the No Tax on Tips Act. “For the past decade, Sen. Cruz has consistently been President Trump’s strongest ally in the Senate,” the spokesperson said. “Sen. Cruz and President Trump are very good friends, and no amount of sniping from disgruntled anonymous staffers trying to score political points is going to change that.” White House spokespeople did not respond to a request to comment for this article. But Trump also characterized the relationship as friendly when asked about Cruz’s 2028 prospects this week. “I mean, I haven’t spoken to him, but it’s a little early,” Trump told reporters Monday in the Oval Office, praising Cruz on the one hand while savoring his victory over him on the other. “He’s a very good friend of mine. You remember, we had quite a campaign against Ted, and it worked out quite nicely. Let’s see, where are we? Oh, we’re in the Oval Office.” For the moment, Trump’s aides and allies are carrying the grudges for him. Cruz, working through his staff, “has consistently worked to stifle the administration, while claiming ignorance,” a person close to the White House said. This person added, channeling Trump’s nickname of Cruz from the 2016 primaries: “Once Lyin’ Ted, always Lyin’ Ted, and everyone sees his game.” The unilateral subpoena issue “really pissed people off in the White House,” said another person close to the administration. Cruz also was among the early Republican critics of Trump’s tariff policy. Neither Cruz nor Vance has announced plans to run for president in 2028. Trump, who is constitutionally barred from serving a third term, has not endorsed a successor but has identified Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio — like Cruz, a vanquished 2016 rival — as potential heirs to his MAGA movement. Early polls of the prospective 2028 field peg Vance as the GOP front-runner. And Trump is sharing a modest but notable portion of his fundraising proceeds with him. As Trump’s vice president, Vance has been careful not to get too far and disloyally off script from Trump. Cruz, operating from outside the administration, has fewer political constraints. He is also a known advocate on free speech issues and a critic of Big Tech — long-held positions that have informed the fights he has picked with the administration. “Big Tech censorship poses a serious threat to free speech in the U.S., and my Committee has previously uncovered evidence of these platforms using vague terms of service agreements to silence conservative voices,” Cruz said in July, when he reintroduced legislation targeting companies like Slack and Eventbrite. Cruz’s pushback on the White House has escalated since September. He criticized Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr for threatening to police remarks that late-night host Jimmy Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk — and has scheduled an FCC oversight hearing for next month, with Carr as a witness. Meanwhile, the Isaacman renomination has surfaced as a major tension point. Cruz had favored keeping NASA under the leadership of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who has been serving as the agency’s acting administrator, the three people familiar with the nomination process said. White House officials were surprised and upset this week when Cruz scheduled a new confirmation hearing for Isaacman, these people added. Isaacman had a hearing in April, before Trump withdrew his nomination in the midst of a feud with Elon Musk, an Isaacman ally. The White House had expected he would move immediately to a confirmation vote. “Cruz has gone out of his way to throw a wrench in the process, which has pissed off the White House,” one of the people familiar with the process said, adding that they believe the episode spoke to Cruz’s desire to tangle with Vance. A person close to Isaacman’s confirmation process blamed the delay on the unique situation of being nominated, having that nomination pulled by the White House, and then being nominated again, causing the process to reset. Cruz’s public attacks on Carlson have perhaps invited the most speculation about his 2028 intentions, given how the attacks have served to call attention to Vance’s relationship with the MAGA-friendly podcaster and former Fox News star. In recent speeches to Jewish audiences, Cruz has warned of a rise in antisemitism on the political right and criticized Carlson for hosting on his show Nick Fuentes, an activist who has espoused white supremacist ideology and said he believes the Holocaust was “exaggerated.” “Sen. Cruz has not hesitated to call out antisemitism wherever it appears, including within his own party,” Jason Wuliger, chair of public affairs for the Jewish Federations of North America, said when introducing the senator at an event the organization hosted this week. “At a time when many of us in the Jewish community feel like the walls are closing in, with the rise of anti-Jewish hate increasing on both sides of the aisle, allies like Sen. Cruz have been in short supply, and he speaks up in impactful ways in influential places.” Carlson’s interview with Fuentes has become a flashpoint among Republicans balancing their support for free speech against their support for Israel. Vance, in an interview last year with CBS News, called Fuentes a “total loser.” Trump, who was criticized for dining with Fuentes in 2022, defended Carlson when speaking with reporters Sunday. “We’ve had some great interviews with Tucker Carlson, but you can’t tell him who to interview,” Trump said. Carlson, in a text message to NBC News, said he has found Cruz’s focus on him to be “hilarious.” “Can you get elected president by running against a podcaster? It’s amusing but mostly it’s revealing of the Republican donor class, which is feeding that buffoon’s ego,” Carlson added. “Pathetic. As for what happens in two years, God knows. Things are changing so fast, I’m bewildered.”",left
"Supreme Court hears Trump tariffs case, key justices appear skeptical of president's power The justices will decide whether a president has unfettered power to tariff. The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday over the legality of President Donald Trump’s global tariffs program in a blockbuster case with extraordinary significance for American consumers and businesses, the nation’s financial health, global diplomacy, and future presidential power. President Trump called it ""one of the most important cases in the history of our country."" If the tariffs are invalidated, the U.S. government could owe tens of billions of dollars of refunds to businesses that have paid them. Such an outcome could also eliminate a primary bargaining chip that Trump has used in negotiations with other countries. A decision upholding the tariffs would cement an expansive new exercise of presidential power and preserve a cornerstone of Trump’s agenda that economists estimate could boost some U.S. manufacturing in the long run but cost American families an average of more than $1,700 this year alone in higher prices. Justices appear skeptical of Trump's tariff authority The Constitution gives Congress the exclusive authority to levy taxes on citizens and duties on imports, with a few limited exceptions adopted over the years to give the president some discretion during times of national crisis. The key question in the Trump case is whether the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act gives a president unfettered ability to set tariffs for any country, at any level, for as long as needed, whenever an emergency is declared at the president’s sole discretion. Trump is the first president to try use the IEEPA to set tariffs without Congress, and the justices pushed Solicitor General John Sauer to justify the sweeping authority. Sauer argued the tariffs are ""regulatory"" in nature, and that any revenue raised is incidental. That, despite Trump often boasting the billions of dollars he says the administration has raked in as a result of the levies. ""We don't contend that what's being exercised here is the power to tax, it's the power to regulate foreign commerce. These are regulatory tariffs, they are not revenue-raising tariffs. The fact that the raise revenue is only incidental,"" Sauer said. Sauer then faced a barrage of questions from the justices, including several conservatives, who appeared skeptical of Trump’s tariff authority under IEEPA. ""The vehicle is the imposition of taxes on Americans. That has always been the core power of Congress,"" Chief Justice John Roberts, considered a key vote in the case, said at one point. Later, Roberts summarized the plaintiffs’ argument against tariffs by suggesting that the tariffs ""reach into the pockets of the American people"" like a tax. ""It does seem to me – tell me if I'm wrong – that the really key part of the context here, if not the dispositive one for you, is the constitutional assignment taxing power to Congress,"" Roberts said. ""The power to reach into the pockets of the American people is just different."" Sauer responded, ""They are clearly regulatory tariffs, not taxes."" In another notable exchange, Justice Neil Gorsuch expressed a concern that the Trump administration is taking too much authority from Congress under its interpretation of the law. At one point, he suggested the Trump administration’s view contributes to a ""a one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people’s elected representatives"" in Congress. ""I'm struggling and waiting for -- what's the reason to accept the notion that Congress can hand off the power to declare war to the president?"" he asked Sauer. Gorsuch then flipped the script, questioning whether a future administration would be able to use the same authority to impose tariffs under a climate change emergency. ""It's very likely that can be done. ... This administration would say that's a hoax. It's not a it's not a real crisis,” Sauer responded. ""I am sure you would,"" Gorsuch quipped. Justice Samuel Alito signaled some support for the Trump administration’s argument, acknowledging the president’s broad authority during emergencies. “Wouldn't you agree that statutes that confer on the president real emergency powers are often phrased much more broadly than other statutes? Isn't it the very nature of an emergency?” Alito asked Neal Katyal, who argued on behalf of the challengers. ""I know you dispute the fact that this is a real emergency,"" Alito added. But kooking to the future, Justice Barrett asked Katyal what would happen if the court were to side against the president and rule the tariffs unlawful. “If you win, tell me how the reimbursement process would work. Would it be a complete mess?” she asked. Katyal responded by noting that an administrative process exists to get refunded, thought he process could take a while. “There's got to be an administrative protest. There was…a case earlier that this court was involved with,” he said. “The refund process took a long time for any number of claims.” “So, a mess,” Barrett said. Court has never examined IEEPA’s meaning Shortly after taking office, Trump issued executive orders declaring an emergency over illegal immigration and drug trafficking from Mexico, Canada, and China. In April, he issued another executive order declaring an emergency over ""large and persistent trade deficits"" with dozens of countries around the world. Trump subsequently imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to more than 100% on goods imported from each country. A coalition of small business owners and Democrat-led states sued Trump over the tariffs arguing both that the word ""regulate"" in the law does not cover tariffs or taxes, which are not explicitly mentioned, and that the ""emergencies"" Trump declared are neither unusual nor extraordinary as required by the law. ""Congress, not the president, decides whether and how much to tax Americans who import goods from abroad,"" the states wrote in their legal brief to the court. ""This Court should reject the president’s bid to seize that power for himself."" The high court has never before examined IEEPA’s meaning. ""This is a staggeringly important case from an economic perspective and from a separation of powers perspective,"" said Hofstra Law professor and ABC News legal contributor James Sample. ""If the court greenlights the tariffs, then this is a new world order in terms of the constitutional scheme for taxing, for spending, and for regulating all aspects of the economy,"" Sample said. The Court of International Trade, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and a Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., all ruled in favor of the tariff challengers. The Court of International Trade also invalidated Trump’s drug trafficking tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China by noting that the dangers of illicit drug trafficking do not amount to ""an unusual and extraordinary threat."" The courts allowed tariffs to remain in effect until the Supreme Court reaches a final decision. Tariffs have become a major source of revenue for the federal government, estimated to raise $2.8 trillion over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The financial impact has hit many American small businesses particularly hard. Learning Resources Inc., a manufacturer of children’s toys based near Chicago, Illinois, and one of the plaintiffs in the case, said the tariffs have wiped out profits and brought hiring to a standstill. ""We paid $2.3 million in tariffs in 2024,"" said CEO Rick Woldenberg. ""Based on our 2025 budget, we would have paid $100 million in tariffs at Trump’s 145% rate on China. It’s receded a little bit from there, but it’s still a very disruptive expense that we can’t bear on our own."" Cassie Abel, CEO of Idaho-based women’s technical clothing company Wild Rye, said tariffs have threatened to force her out of business. ""The supply chain for what we produce doesn’t exist here in the U.S.,"" Abel said of her ski and cycle gear made in China. ""Textiles have not been a priority of this administration, and it would take significant investment from our country to bring textiles at any sort of scale back to the U.S."" Aabesh De, founder and CEO of Flora, a Tennessee company which produces smart plant monitors in China, said tariffs have “crippled” plans for new products and innovation. ""It’s a man-made existential crisis the likes of which we haven’t seen since covid, and it’s frustrating,"" De said. Regardless of how the court rules, some of Trump’s tariffs and tariff authority will remain untouched -- though much more constrained by federal law. More than a third of U.S. imports, including steel, aluminum, cars, machinery and medical devices, are subject to import taxes under Section 232 of Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to apply tariffs on targeted industries in the interest of national security. Provisions in the Trade Act of 1974 also allow the president to impose targeted tariffs on countries over unfair trade practices and trade deficits, but only after an investigation and only at a limited amount, for a limited period of time. The Supreme Court’s conservative majority has been very deferential to executive authority, particularly in matters of foreign policy and national security. But it has also blocked presidential attempts to enact sweeping domestic policies -- such as a nationwide eviction moratorium during the pandemic and a multi-billion dollar student loan forgiveness program -- without the express consent of Congress. ""It's a toss-up, because within the kind of the doctrinal context in which conservatives are operating, you see these two things that pull in different directions,"" said Jonathan Adler, a constitutional law expert at William & Mary Law School. ""If they see it as a foreign affairs case, the administration wins. If they see it as a textual interpretation case, they lose."" The court accepted the Trump tariffs case on a highly expedited basis, but it’s unclear how quickly it will hand down a decision. A ruling is expected before the end of June 2026.",left
"Brazil’s Lula sanctions an increase in tax exemptions for low-income people Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has sanctioned a bill that exempts people earning up to 5,000 reais a month from income taxes RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Wednesday sanctioned a bill that exempts people earning up to 5,000 reais ($940) a month from income taxes, more than doubling the current exemption and meeting a key priority of his 2022 election campaign. “A promise made, a promise kept,” Lula said on X on Wednesday. The measure, which will come into effect next year, also establishes tax discounts for incomes up to 7,350 reais ($1400). Some 15 million Brazilians will benefit from the new law, according to the presidential palace. Approximately 10 million will no longer pay income tax, while 5 million will benefit from a reduction. To offset the loss of state revenue, the government will introduce a minimum effective tax rate for high-income individuals. The new minimum effective tax would apply to people who earn over 600,000 reais (approximately $113,000) a year, ramping up from zero to 10% for those who earn over 1,200,000 reais (some $226,000) annually. The new legislation will target some 140,000 wealthy individuals in the country, who on average currently pay an effective tax rate of 2.5%, according to Brazil’s Finance Ministry. Popular Reads Some 90% of the country’s population earned less than 4040 reais ($750) in 2024, when considering household income per capita, according to Brazil’s national statistics agency IGBE. The bill passed the House and the Senate unanimously, reflecting the broad public support for the tax exemption. The adoption of the bill is a political victory for Lula, who will run for a fourth term next year. Both Lula and Bolsonaro pledged to at least double the income tax exemption during the hotly contested 2022 election, which Lula narrowly won. Bolsonaro had also committed to the reform when campaigning in 2018, to no avail. Lula had been facing plummeting popularity, but he recovered as an unintended effect of U.S. President Donald Trump’s politically-motivated 50% tariff on a range of Brazilian imports. The U.S. has since revoked many of those tariffs.",left
"A day after Thursday’s anxiety-inducing fake out, Friday turned into Redemption Day on Wall Street. The Dow ended the day 493 points higher, or 1.08%, after gaining as much as 800 points earlier in the day. The broader S&P 500 finished out the day 0.98% higher and the Nasdaq was up by 0.88%. The earlier bounce back came after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said he supported lowering near-term interest rates, giving traders hope that they could get a December rate cut, after all. Friday’s gains cap a topsy-turvy and highly confusing week for markets. What happened? Going into Thursday, the sagging stock market had two big questions it wanted answered: Is the artificial intelligence bubble about to burst, and will the Fed cut interest rates in December? At first, it seemed like traders finally got the clear response they had been eagerly awaiting: - Nvidia reported super-strong earnings Wednesday evening, initially easing fears that demand for AI had faded. - And Thursday morning’s jobs report showed the unemployment rate had risen unexpectedly, and the US economy had lost jobs in August for the second time in three months. The market bet the Fed could be forced to lower rates next month to give the labor market a needed boost. Phew. Right? Wrong. Traders at first cheered Thursday morning, sending all three major stock indexes sharply higher. At one point, the Dow was up more than 700 points. But by late morning, the rally started to wear off, and sentiment – and markets – turned sharply negative by midday. Traders came to realize that the answers they thought they received actually just raised new, more difficult questions. “People are trying to figure out A.) What’s better than off the charts in terms of what Nvidia can say from here and realizing that there’s no reward at these levels and B.) how the Fed can cut if jobs numbers are really better,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital. By the end of the day Thursday, it was like nothing had changed: Markets resumed their slide that has sent the S&P 500 down more than 5% from the all-time high it reached just before Halloween. - The Dow, in an 1,100-point swing – its biggest since the tariff-induced turmoil in April – fell nearly 400 points by the end of Thursday. - The S&P 500 fell 1.6% and the Nasdaq tumbled more than 2%. - Nvidia (NVDA), which had gained as much as 5% earlier in the day, closed 3% down. - And bitcoin, which initially rallied above $92,000, fell to close to $86,000 late Thursday. Markets rebounded Friday, but Nvidia was essentially flat. Bitcoin dropped by around 2% to levels not seen since April and is on pace for its worst month since 2022. So, what’s next? Nvidia’s quarterly earnings were so blow-out that investors began to fear that the world’s most valuable company and maker of the most precious commodity in tech – high-end AI chips – couldn’t possibly keep up this pace of growth for much longer. Eventually, demand will ebb. And even if it doesn’t anytime soon, the AI market isn’t just Nvidia – other, less powerful companies could still be overinflated. Perhaps, traders feared, Nvidia’s earnings didn’t actually answer any of their questions at all. Investors also looked more closely at a particularly confusing jobs report and realized it might not say exactly what they initially thought: The headline number showed much stronger-than-expected hiring in September, suggesting that the worst of the early-summer hiring slowdown may be behind us. The unemployment rate may have risen because more workers were entering the labor force, resuming their job searches after the summer lull. Williams’ glass appears to be half empty. But if the Fed takes a glass-half-full approach – particularly after minutes from its last meeting released Wednesday showed significant resistance to another rate cut in December – perhaps that rate cut won’t be coming next month, after all. So here we are on Friday, right back where we started. CNN’s Fear and Greed Index is in “extreme fear” mode and at its lowest level since – you guessed it – April. The VIX volatility index briefly spiked to 27, its highest level since… do we even need to say it? Until investors get satisfactory answers to their questions, expect more market volatility going forward. But with shutdown-delayed government data, an end to earnings season and traders about to go on vacation for the holidays, it’s not clear those answers are coming anytime soon.

"Costco Wholesale has sued the Trump administration before the Court of International Trade, asking it to consider all tariffs collected under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act unlawful. The company said in a filing Friday that it is seeking a “full refund” of all duties under the act paid as a result of President Donald Trump's executive order that imposed what he called ""reciprocal"" tariffs. “Because IEEPA does not clearly authorize the President to set tariffs ... the Challenged Tariff Orders cannot stand and the defendants are not authorized to implement and collect them,” Costco's lawyer writes in the lawsuit. The Supreme Court is reviewing the legality of Trump's sweeping tariff agenda. In oral arguments in early November, justices appeared skeptical about the government's case. Both conservative and liberal justices asked tough questions to Solicitor General D. John Sauer, though some of the conservatives seemed more sympathetic to his arguments. Trump became the first president ever to use the IEEPA law to impose import duties. Lower courts earlier ruled against the administration's use of the law but kept the tariffs in place while the case was argued. Costco does not say in the filing how much the duties have cost the company; importers have paid nearly $90 billion under the IEEPA law, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data through late September. In May, on Costco's earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip told investors that about a third of Costco's sales in the U.S. are imported products. Millerchip said items imported from China represented about 8% of total U.S. sales. Millerchip said that while Costco was seeing a direct impact from tariffs on imports of some fresh food items from Central and South America, it decided not to increase prices ""because they are key staple items"" for its customers. Some of those fresh food items included pineapples and bananas. ""We essentially held the price on those to make sure that we're protecting the member,"" he said. In September, Millerchip told analysts: ""We continue to work closely with our suppliers to find ways to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including moving the country of production where it makes sense and consolidating our buying efforts globally to lower the cost of goods across all our markets."" Through the end of October, the government had collected $205 billion in tariffs. ""The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump’s lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement Tuesday. ""The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court’s speedy and proper resolution of this matter."" With Friday's lawsuit, Costco becomes the latest major company to seek tariff refunds through the courts. Global cosmetics giant Revlon, eyeglasses maker EssilorLuxottica, motorcycle manufacturer Kawasaki, canned foods seller Bumble Bee, Japanese auto supplier Yokohama Tire and many smaller firms have also filed similar suits.",left
"The Fed is divided over cutting interest rates. Here's why that matters Sentiment has shifted dramatically in favor of an interest rate cut. Top officials at the Federal Reserve have displayed a rare degree of public disagreement over a possible interest rate cut next month. In recent days, sentiment shifted dramatically in favor of an interest rate cut as some influential central bankers voiced openness toward the move, futures markets showed. Still, discord remains. A rate cut could reduce expenses associated with everything from home mortgages to credit cards to car payments, making it cheaper to get a loan or refinance one. The policy would also ease borrowing for businesses and potentially boost hiring, but it risks driving up inflation at a time when many Americans struggle with everyday costs. “We haven’t seen this much uncertainty from the Fed in a long time,” John Sedunov, a finance professor at Villanova University's School of Business, told ABC News. Here’s what to know about why the Fed is divided over its rate decision and what the policy could mean for you. Why is the Fed divided over a possible interest rate cut? Inflation has picked up in recent months, putting price increases a full percentage point above the Fed’s target of 2%. Meanwhile, hiring has slowed, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as ""stagflation."" Those conditions have put the Fed in a bind, since the central bank must balance a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment. To address pressure on both of its goals, the Fed primarily holds a single tool: interest rates. “We have one tool,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month. “You can’t address both of those at once.” If the Fed holds interest rates steady as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation, it risks a deeper slowdown of the labor market. On the other hand, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a hiring slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation. Policymakers at the Fed disagree about whether to prioritize containing inflation or jolting employment, John Sedunov, a finance professor at Villanova University's School of Business, told ABC News. “The Fed is fighting with this idea: Do we push inflation more toward our goal or do we do something about the job market?” Sedunov said. “It’s a tough line to walk.” Why is momentum building in favor of an interest rate cut? The odds have shifted significantly in favor of an interest rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting. The chances of a quarter-point interest rate cut stand at nearly 85%, surging from a level as low as 30% last week, according to CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment. The prospects appeared to move in response to a murky jobs report and public statements from two allies of Powell on the committee charged with setting rates. On Friday, a jobs report for September sent mixed signals about the labor market. Employers added far more workers than expected in September, though hiring fell short of a breakneck clip. Meanwhile the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, a low figure by historical standards but the highest recorded since October 2021. New York Fed President John Williams, who is often in lockstep with Powell, on Friday voiced openness toward a rate cut, telling reporters he still saw “room for a further adjustment in the near term.” Days later, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley took a similar position, telling reporters she sees room “for a further adjustment in the near term.” Daley, who isn’t voting on interest rates this year, is widely viewed as a supporter of Powell. “Both of them came out in pretty clear support of a rate cut,” Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Federal Reserve official, told ABC News. “Both are pretty centrist and close to chair [Powell].” “A week ago, things were up in the air. They mostly moved because of Williams and Daley,” Gagnon added. What would an interest rate cut mean for you? A quarter-point interest rate cut would reduce the Fed’s benchmark rate to a level between 3.5% and 3.75%. That figure would mark a significant pullback from a peak in 2023. At the outset of the pandemic, interest rates stood at 0%. Still, a reduction of interest rates could offer some relief for mortgage and credit card borrowers. Savers, however, stand to lose income as interest rates decline for accounts held at banks.",left
"When Simon Coveney was minister for foreign affairs he used an analogy to explain his job to his young daughters, likening politics and diplomacy to building bridges. You can’t build many bridges in just 10 months, so it is difficult to assess Tánaiste Simon Harris’s time heading up the Department of Foreign Affairs as he takes over as Minister for Finance after Paschal Donohoe’s departure from politics to take up a senior job at the World Bank in Washington, DC. Sources inside the department and Ireland’s diplomatic service describe Harris as a minister who was liked on a personal level, a strong communicator and seen to handle the fraught transatlantic dispute over trade tariffs well. However, the same figures highlight Harris’s tendency to be overly concerned with messaging and how things were landing in the press. They also mention his comparatively low footfall abroad and question his management of the competing demands as minister, Tánaiste, and Fine Gael leader. READ MORE After almost a year on the international stage as taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs was the obvious choice for Harris when picking what ministerial job he wanted in the Coalition Government. He met department secretary general Joe Hackett in the quiet stretch between Christmas and the new year to start reading himself into the role, while coalition negotiations were still ongoing Four days after the Government was sworn in on January 23rd, Harris was in Brussels for a meeting of the European Union’s 27 foreign ministers. He had represented Ireland at a high-level summit of EU leaders as taoiseach the month before. Two discussions Harris had on the margins of that foreign ministers meeting would say a lot. Harris sat down with EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, a key figure in tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington, and Spain’s foreign minister José Manuel Albares, a close ally of Ireland on Gaza. US president Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff agenda threatened to blow up the transatlantic trading relationship that underpins Ireland’s economic success. The State’s diplomatic engine had to kick into a gear not seen since the Brexit days, to avoid a damaging EU-US trade war. [ Simon Harris is a skilled politician. But is he Minister for Finance material?Opens in new window ] The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm led by Ursula von der Leyen that steers trade policy, was under pressure from French president Emmanuel Macron and others to square up to Trump. Ireland, in contrast, was one of the loudest voices for caution, appealing for the EU to avoid antagonising Trump and escalating the dispute. Of particular concern was the suggestion that US tech multinationals with bases in the State could be targeted by Brussels if matters escalated. “He conveyed Ireland’s unique exposure to the EU-US trade complications very well at the European level,” one commission official said of Harris. A big focus was put on forging direct links to the Trump administration. Harris spoke to US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer several times. That was tricky during those early, chaotic months. An initial phone call between Harris and Lutnick in March was repeatedly delayed over the course of the day. By the time Harris and the commerce secretary finally spoke it was 1am Irish time and Harris had to take the call sitting in the kitchen of his Co Wicklow home. The EU ultimately agreed to suck up tariffs of 15 per cent to draw a line under the months of destabilising uncertainty . Harris is credited by Jonathan Tonge, professor of politics at University of Liverpool, with making a “significant contribution” to improved relations between Dublin and London. Tonge, who has written extensively about Northern Ireland politics, said he was “greatly assisted” by the change in UK government. Harris, then taoiseach, was the first foreign leader to visit the UK after Labour leader Keir Starmer became prime minister last year. A picture of the pair at the prime minister’s country residence at Chequers enjoying a pint and engaging in Guinness diplomacy pointed to friendlier Irish-British relations after the tensions of the Brexit years. As minister for foreign affairs Harris had extensive behind-the-scenes talks with Hilary Benn, UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to resolve thorny Troubles legacy issues. Those close to Harris single out his work helping to broker a recent agreement in that area as one of his major achievements this year. [ Simon Harris denies latest Troubles legacy proposals are ‘last roll of the dice’Opens in new window ] One criticism repeated by several sources in Iveagh House and the wider Irish diplomatic circuit is that Harris could appear stretched at times. His responsibility, alongside Taoiseach Micheál Martin, to keep the wider Coalition show on the road, and his role as Fine Gael leader, fuelled a sense that his focus was pulled away from his department at times. Harris undertook 18 official trips abroad as minister, according to figures from the department. That included regular travel to EU meetings in Brussels and Luxembourg and several trips to the US and the UK. He also travelled to a G20 summit of foreign ministers in Johannesburg. Excluding a trip stateside, he undertook one purely “bilateral” visit as minister for foreign affairs, to Berlin in July. In comparison, when Martin was minister for foreign affairs the Fianna Fáil leader clocked up 28 official overseas trips in 2023, travelling to China, Ukraine, South Africa, Cairo, Israel and the West Bank, as well as the usual roster of EU meetings and visits to the US and UK. If the amount of overseas travel was down under Harris, the number of statements and press releases issued by his department was definitely up, multiple sources said. That sometimes rankled the more cautious instincts of career officials and diplomats, who tend to favour the Government pausing and assessing some new development, before commenting publicly. A strong communicator, the 39-year-old is known to fixate on media coverage. Those in the Harris camp argue that communication is a crucial part of modern government. “You have to tell people what you’re doing,” one figure close to the Tánaiste said. Another significant moment of his tenure was bringing legislation to Cabinet to ban trade with illegal Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories. Whether the finalised Occupied Territories Bill bans both goods and services will be a question his replacement in Iveagh House, Helen McEntee, will have to answer. “On trade he’d get a better mark than on the pure foreign policy side of things,” said one seasoned Irish official in their assessment. EU officials who observed him during closed-door meetings of foreign ministers said he could read the room well, tailoring Ireland’s interventions to bring counterparts onside, during debates about Gaza and other topics. Harris did not shy away from nudging the debate around defence and security forward when wearing his fourth hat, Minister for Defence. In a speech at an Iveagh House reception for ambassadors from other EU states, Harris said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “fundamentally altered the European security landscape”. “Political opponents like to caricature a response to oncoming threats to Europe by discussing Nato membership or European armies. These are the simple, polarising arguments of undergraduate seminars from decades ago”, he told dignitaries at the July 1st event. Ireland had to step up with the rest of Europe in response, he said. Harris pushed for significantly more to be spent on defence and ran up against opposition from the Department of Public Expenditure on this. In his new job as Minister for Finance he will have a much greater say in how the State manages its finances. That will entail saying no to the demands of many colleagues for more spending across Government – and probably issuing fewer press releases too.",left

"The FBI looks to speak to the six Democrats whom Trump accused of ""seditious behavior."" The U.S. told Ukraine it's better to negotiate a peace settlement now because of the dire situation on the battlefield. And Medicare announces significant price cuts to 15 costly prescription drugs, including popular weight loss medications. Here's what to know today. FBI seeks interviews with Democrats Trump accused of ‘seditious behavior’ The FBI is working to schedule interviews with the six Democratic lawmakers who appeared in a video urging members of the military and intelligence community not to comply with illegal orders, according to a person familiar with the efforts. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. The move comes days after President Donald Trump accused the Democrats, all of whom served in the military or in intelligence roles, of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!,” although he later claimed he was “not threatening death.” Details of the investigation were not immediately clear. The lawmakers confirmed they had heard from the House or Senate sergeants-at-arms about the FBI effort. In a joint statement, four of the Democrats in the video, all members of the House, accused Trump of ""using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass Members of Congress."" The statement came from Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania. The other two Democrats in the video are senators: Mark Kelly, of Arizona, and Elissa Slotkin, of Michigan. The Defense Department announced it was opening an investigation into Kelly, a retired Navy captain, saying he was subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice as a retired member of the military. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a memo on X directing the secretary of the Navy to report ""on the outcome of your review"" by Dec. 10.

Medicare announces price cuts for 15 prescription drugs The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced lower prices on 15 costly prescription drugs under Medicare that include Ozempic and Wegovy. The price cuts come through the Medicare drug price negotiation program created under the Inflation Reduction Act, which then-President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022. It's different from Trump's ""most favored nation"" drug pricing approach, which relies on executive orders and voluntary deals with drugmakers — not legislation. Trump recently announced such a deal with Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, to lower the price of the drugs in exchange for tariff relief. The negotiated prices are what Medicare will pay drugmakers for the medicines, not what patients will pay out of pocket. Those discounts will save taxpayers $12 billion, according to CMS. It's expected to save Medicare enrollees $685 million in out of pocket costs in 2027. Read the story and see the full list of reduced price drugs.

Staff Pick: As we age, the brain rewires The human brain rewires itself as we age. The process happens in distinct phases, or ""epochs,"" according to new research, as the structure of our neural networks changes and our brains reconfigure how we think and process information. For the first time, scientists said they've identified four distinct turning points between those phases in an average brain: at ages 9, 32, 66 and 83. During each epoch between those years, our brains show markedly different characteristics in brain architecture, they said. Science reporter Evan Bush looked at the findings published in the journal Nature Communications that could help identify why mental health and neurological conditions develop during particular phases of rewiring. — Christian Orozco, newsletter and platforms editor NBC Select: Online Shopping, Simplified The NBC Select team rounded up the best last-minute Black Friday savings — including discounts on indoor TV antennas and Shutterfly deals for anyone racing to finish their holiday cards.

"President Donald Trump littered his new “60 Minutes” interview with a wide-ranging assortment of false claims, the vast majority of them previously debunked. We counted at least 18 inaccurate assertions. Trump told his usual lie that the free and fair 2020 election was stolen from him. He lied again that grocery prices “are down” even after CBS’ Norah O’Donnell informed him they are up. He declared once more that there is now “no inflation,” though there certainly is, and then that inflation is 2% or “even less than 2%,” though the most recent available Consumer Price Index figure is now up to 3%. The president also deployed multiple other fictional numbers during his exchanges with O’Donnell, which were recorded Friday and released by CBS on Sunday. - He falsely claimed “$17 trillion” is being invested in the US “right now,” though the $17 trillion figure is nearly double the White House’s own wildly inflated figure. - He falsely claimed each alleged drug boat the US has attacked in recent weeks “kills 25,000 Americans,” though experts note this figure plainly does not make sense. - He falsely claimed some recent former presidents invoked the Insurrection Act “28 times,” though no individual president has invoked it on more than six occasions with this record set by President Ulysses S. Grant in the 1800s. - He falsely claimed he has ended “eight wars,” though his list includes two situations that were not wars at all and at least one war that continues. - He falsely claimed CBS aired an edited interview with Trump’s 2024 opponent Kamala Harris “two days” before the election, though it was actually more than four full weeks before Election Day. - He falsely claimed former President Joe Biden gave $350 billion in aid to Ukraine (the real number is well under half that) and allowed in “25 million” migrants (the real number here is well under half that, too). And Trump made a variety of additional false claims on several subjects, including the government shutdown, the artificial intelligence boom, tariffs, his first impeachment and his former legal battle with “60 Minutes” itself. CBS posted a full transcript of the interview, which O’Donnell said ran for nearly 90 minutes, and a nearly 73-minute video; it aired about 28 minutes on television. Here is a more detailed breakdown of Trump’s claims. The economy Grocery prices When O’Donnell noted that Americans have “seen their grocery prices go up,” Trump repeated his regular false claim that grocery prices are actually declining: “No, you’re wrong. They went up under Biden. Right now they’re going down. Other than beef, which we’re working on, which we can solve very quickly.” Trump repeated later in the interview, “Our groceries are down.” Grocery prices are up under Trump — and while there has been a particularly large increase in the price of beef, there have also been increases in the price of numerous other products. Consumer Price Index figures for September showed average grocery prices had increased since August (about 0.3%), since September 2024 (about 2.7%), and since January 2025 (about 1.4%), the month Trump returned to office. Prices in all six major grocery product categories tracked by the Consumer Price Index, such as “fruits and vegetables” and “cereals and bakery products,” are up over the past year. Inflation under Trump Trump falsely claimed, “We have no inflation” and “we don’t have any inflation.” (He said at another point of the interview that “essentially we don’t have inflation.”) He also falsely claimed, “We’re down to 2%, even less than 2%.” There is inflation; it has been worsening since May after hitting a four-year low in April; and it’s not 2% or less than 2%. The year-over-year rate was about 3% in September, up from about 2.9% in August; the September figure was nearly identical to the roughly 3% rate in January, the last partial month of the Biden administration and first partial month of the second Trump administration. Inflation under Biden Trump falsely claimed that President Joe “Biden gave me the worst inflation rate in the history of our country” and that “I inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country.” Trump could have fairly said the US inflation rate hit a 40-year high under Biden in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920 — and, again, the rate then declined to about 3% in January 2025, the month Trump took over from Biden. Trump’s claim was also wrong if he was claiming there was record cumulative inflation over the course of Biden’s presidency. It was about 21%, compared with about 49% during President Jimmy Carter’s term. Investment in the US Trump repeated his frequent false claim that “we have $17 trillion being invested in the United States right now,” then said moments later that it is “more than $17 trillion right now.” This “$17 trillion” figure is fictional even without the “more than.” As of the time the “60 Minutes” interview aired on Sunday, the White House’s own website said the “major investment announcements” this term totaled “$8.9 trillion” — and a detailed CNN review in October found the White House was counting trillions of dollars in vague investment pledges from foreign countries and companies, pledges that were about “bilateral trade” or “economic exchange” rather than investment in the US, or vague statements that didn’t even rise to the level of pledges. You can read more here. Who pays tariffs Trump claimed, as he often does, that China and other foreign countries pay the tariffs he has imposed on their exports. In reality, US importers, not China or other foreign countries, make the tariff payments to the US government, and they often pass on at least some of the costs to consumers; study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, found that people and entities in the US bore almost the entire cost of Trump’s first-term tariffs on Chinese products. AI and power Trump correctly noted that some artificial intelligence companies are moving to generate their own power on the same sites as their energy-hungry data centers — but falsely added that letting companies make their own electricity “was my idea, which nobody, frankly, had thought of.” There is simply no basis for Trump’s claim that he came up with this idea. News articles last year, when Trump was an out-of-office candidate for president, discussed how AI companies were already experimenting with on-site power generation and how the Biden administration was on board with the idea; one article from April 2024, for example, discussed how the Energy Department was “exploring how energy-hungry tech firms might be able to host small nuclear plants on the campuses of their massive data centers.” Foreign policy Strikes on alleged drug boats After Trump was asked about the recent US military strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, he said, “Every one of those boats kills 25,000 Americans. Every single boat that you see that’s shot down kills 25,000 on drugs, and destroys families all over our country.” Aside from the fact that the Trump administration has not presented public proof for his repeated claims that the boats carried fentanyl, the drug involved in the highest number of US overdose deaths — the Caribbean is not known to be a significant fentanyl-smuggling route — his “25,000” number does not make sense. The total number of US overdose deaths from all drugs in 2024 was about 82,000, according to provisional federal data. Trump is essentially claiming, in other words, that attacking 16 boats prevented more than four years’ worth of American overdose deaths. The president’s figure is “absurd,” Carl Latkin, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health with a joint appointment at its medical school, said in October. “He’s claiming that he’s solved the overdose mortality crisis” with four boat strikes, and “that does not have any semblance of reality.” You can read a longer fact check here. Trump and wars Trump repeated his false claim that he “knocked out eight wars,” adding, “I took eight wars and stopped (them) during an eight-month period” this presidency. Reading from a paper, he listed “Cambodia-Thailand,” “Kosovo-Serbia,” “the Congo and Rwanda,” “Pakistan and India,” “Israel and Iran,” “Egypt and Ethiopia,” “Armenia and Azerbaijan,” and “Israel and Hamas.” Trump’s “eight” figure is a clear exaggeration. There was no war between Egypt and Ethiopia for Trump to end; the two countries were in a long-running diplomatic dispute about a major Ethiopian dam project on a tributary of the Nile River, but that is not a war, and the dispute is unresolved. Trump’s list includes another supposed war that didn’t occur during his presidency, between Kosovo and Serbia. (He has sometimes claimed to have prevented the eruption of a new war between those two entities, providing few details about what he meant, but that is different from settling an actual war.) And the war involving the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda has continued despite a peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration this year — which was never signed by the leading rebel coalition doing the fighting. One can debate the importance of Trump’s role in having ended the other conflicts on his list, or fairly question whether some of them have truly ended. For example, killing has continued in Gaza after the October ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Regardless, Trump’s “eight” figure is too big. Biden and aid to Ukraine Trump repeated his false claim that “Joe Biden gave $350 billion to Ukraine, including a lot of weapons, a tremendous amount of weapons.” The “$350 billion” figure isn’t close to accurate. The US government inspector general overseeing the federal Ukraine response says the US had disbursed about $94 billion as of the end of June 2025 (and had appropriated about $93 billion more), including money that was spent in the US and in broader Europe rather than Ukraine itself. And a German think tank that has closely tracked wartime aid to Ukraine says the US allocated about $135 billion to Ukraine (and had committed about $5 billion more) through August, at current exchange rates. Immigration The shutdown, Democrats and immigrants Talking about the ongoing government shutdown, Trump said of Democrats, “I can’t give them $1.5 trillion so that they can give welfare to people that came into our country illegally.” But that is not what Democrats are seeking. Democrats are primarily proposing to reverse Trump-approved cuts to Medicaid and other health programs and to extend the enhanced pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Undocumented people are not eligible for either Obamacare subsidies or federal Medicaid insurance coverage (though hospitals are required to provide people with emergency care regardless of immigration status or ability to pay). Trump’s White House itself has claimed that Democrats are proposing to spend about $193 billion (not $1.5 trillion) on health care for “illegal immigrants and other non-citizens” and the White House published an itemized list that makes clear that even by its own contested calculations, the majority of even that smaller sum would be for these “other non-citizens” who are in the US legally. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, has estimated that the spending proposal the Democrats released in September would add $1.5 trillion to the debt over the next decade. But that figure is not about spending on undocumented people in particular. Foreign leaders, prisons and migration Trump repeated his regular claim that foreign countries are deliberately emptying their prisons to somehow send inmates to the US as migrants, at one point identifying Venezuela as a supposed culprit and at another point speaking more broadly — saying “very smart” foreign leaders “want people that are bad out” and so “what do they do? They open their jails, they let ‘em out. They get rid of their drug dealers, they let ‘em out. But you know who else they get out? The people that are on welfare that aren’t working. In other words, they have people that just don’t work. They don’t want people that just don’t work, so they put them into our country.” Trump has never substantiated such claims, though he has been making them since his 2024 campaign. Experts on international prison policy and crime in Venezuela have told CNN they have seen no evidence of Venezuela or any other country emptying jails for migration purposes, let alone that these countries actively inserted former prisoners into the US. Migration under Biden Trump repeated his false claim that 25 million migrants were allowed into the country under Biden, though he was more tentative this time than usual, saying, “Probably, I say, 25 million people were let into our country. A lot of people say it was 10 million people. But whether it was 10 or — I believe I’m much closer to the right number. Of the 25, many of them should not be here.” The “25 million” figure is wildly inaccurate; even Trump’s previous “21 million” figure was a major exaggeration. Through December 2024, the last full month under the Biden administration, the federal government had recorded under 11 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during that administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country. Even adding in the so-called gotaways who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2.2 million, there’s no way the total was even close to Trump’s claim. Legal issues, impeachment and the 2020 election Previous presidents and the Insurrection Act Trump spoke of the Insurrection Act, which gives the president sweeping powers to deploy troops to US states if certain vague conditions are met, and said, “Do you know that some of the presidents, recent ones, have used it 28 times? 28 times.” No president has invoked the act on more occasions than President Ulysses S. Grant’s six (after the Civil War in the 1800s), and no president has invoked it since President George H.W. Bush in 1992, according to research published in 2022 by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. In fact, the Insurrection Act and the similar laws that preceded it have been invoked on a total of 30 occasions in US history, the Brennan Center found. Trump also said, “Do you know how many presidents have used the Insurrection Act? Almost 50% of ‘em.” That’s at least a slight exaggeration. Seventeen of the 45 presidents to date, so just under 38%, have invoked the act or its precursor laws, according to the Brennan Center. You can read more here. Trump’s legal dispute with “60 Minutes” Trump discussed his now-resolved legal dispute with “60 Minutes” over an edit the show made to an October 2024 interview with his election opponent, then-Vice President Harris — and, as CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter noted Sunday, Trump falsely claimed this supposedly “election-changing” interview occurred “two nights before the election.” The interview actually happened on October 7, 2024, four weeks and a day before Election Day on November 5, 2024. This wasn’t the first time Trump made the Harris interview sound closer to Election Day than it was. He falsely claimed in June that it occurred “the day before the election.” Trump and the Justice Department CBS’ O’Donnell noted the recent indictments of three targets of Trump criticism — former FBI Director James Comey, former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, and New York Attorney General Letitia James — and asked him whether he instructed the Justice Department to “go after them”; Trump responded, “No, and not in any way, shape or form. No.” But this is obviously false: he recently put public pressure on the Justice Department to go after Comey and James. Trump wrote in a September social media post directed to “Pam” — Attorney General Pam Bondi, the head of the Justice Department — that Comey, James and Schiff are “all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” that “we can’t delay any longer” and that “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” (Trump intended the post to be a private message to Bondi, a source familiar with the matter told CNN after The Wall Street Journal first reported it.) Trump did not mention Bolton in that social media post; however, it’s worth noting he previously made public calls for his former adviser to be imprisoned over Bolton’s alleged inclusion of classified information in a memoir. A false story about Democrats and Trump’s first impeachment Trump delivered another version of a false story he has told since 2019 about Democrats’ response to a phone call that year in which he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into Biden, who was his looming opponent in the 2020 election. This time, Trump said, “The Democrats knew that I wasn’t guilty, because they didn’t know the — the call was — I didn’t know either: The call was essentially taped. So we knew exactly what the call — when they found out that the call was taped, Nancy Pelosi went crazy. She said, ‘You made me go into this mess.’ She screamed at all these people that made her do it, bad people like (Democratic Rep. Adam) Schiff, etc., etc.” Trump’s narrative is thoroughly inaccurate. Pelosi could not possibly have been angry with Schiff or other allies after finding out the call was “taped” because, more than six years later, there is still no known US tape of the conversation; presidential calls with foreign leaders are not typically recorded by the American side. In reality, the day after Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry in September 2019, Trump’s White House released a rough written transcript of the call. There has never been any indication that seeing the rough transcript made Pelosi feel she had been deceived into the impeachment push; the day the document was released, Pelosi issued a scathing statement accusing Trump of “lawlessness” and attempting “to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.” A Pelosi spokesperson told CNN in 2024 that a Trump story similar to the one he told on “60 Minutes” was “fact-free nonsense.” Trump and the Presidential Records Act Trump decried the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in 2022, during the investigation into his handling of classified documents after his presidency, and he brought back his false claim that the Presidential Records Act permitted him to possess these documents: “They took things that I was allowed to have … under the Presidential Records Act, that I was allowed to have. I had records. I was allowed to have them.” That’s not true. The Presidential Records Act clearly says that all presidential records belong to the federal government the moment the president leaves office. The key sentence from the law is unequivocal: “Upon the conclusion of a President’s term of office, or if a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the last term, the Archivist of the United States shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.” Jason R. Baron, former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told CNN when Trump made such claims during the Biden administration: “Under the Presidential Records Act, not a single document pertaining to the official business of the White House — classified or unclassified — should have been carted off to Mar-A-Lago. President Trump might consider such records to be ‘his,’ but they are not.” That doesn’t mean Trump committed a criminal offense; the Presidential Records Act is not a criminal statute, and Trump was charged in 2023 for allegedly violating other laws. (A judge appointed by Trump dismissed the case in 2024, declaring that the appointment of the special counsel who brought the charges violated the Constitution.) But Trump was, again, wrongly describing what the act says. The 2020 election Trump uttered his regular lie that the 2020 election “was rigged and stolen,” saying at other moments of the interview that “this was a rigged election” and that “one thing I can tell you, the 2020 election was rigged.” Trump legitimately lost a free and fair election to Biden. Trump also falsely claimed, “And it’s been caught … and you see the same information that everybody else does. And it’s coming out now in spades.” Trump didn’t explain what he was talking about, but no election-rigging or widespread fraud has “been caught.”",left
"Ireland’s services sector saw output rise at the fastest rate in 3½ years in November, according to new data. Financial services drove the growth in the sector as optimism among decision-makers rebounded from a four-month low, hitting its highest since February. The overall AIB Ireland Services Business Activity Index continued its recent positive streak in November, rising to 58.5, from 56.7 in October. Any figure greater than 50 indicates expansion of activity in the sector. “New business grew at an accelerating pace in November, reaching the highest level since April 2022, underpinned by a further solid rise in new export business,” said AIB chief economist David McNamara. READ MORE He noted that a “recent recovery in new client demand” had led to an increase in demand for Irish services, with the benefits of greater competitiveness and long-term business investment also being felt. Exports have been a significant source of growth, rising across all four subsectors. The increased demand was matched by a “sharp” rise in employment last month in the services sector, with the rate of job creation the fastest since March – just before US president Donald Trump first announced his import tariff plan. While the rate of staff growth was above the long-run average, the increase was not across the board. The technology, media and telecoms subsector saw staffing levels fall for the third time in the last four months despite an uptick in output and demand for their services. This, Mr McNamara said, “offset somewhat the job creation across other sectors”, tempering the sectoral index for job creation. Costs continue to rise for companies though the rate of input price inflation fell marginally from the six-month high in September. The transport, tourism and leisure sector reported the highest level of inflation. Prices charged by businesses in the services economy rose at the fastest rate since January. The rate of growth in the sector is well ahead of that in other countries across the euro zone, which, at 53.1, saw a more moderate expansion in business activity. In the US, the regional index topped 55. The UK proved the laggard, with a reading of 50.5, largely stagnant. AIB’s measure of both the Irish manufacturing and services sectors, the composite PMI output index, rose for the third month in a row – reflecting growth across the economy. It rose from 53.7 in October to 55.8 in November, largely driven by services sector expansion.",left
"The Supreme Court on Wednesday started weighing the legality of tariffs that have raised costs on clothing and toys from China, cars and trucks from Canada and Mexico, liquor from Europe, and much more. During arguments, both conservative and liberal justices appeared skeptical about whether the tariffs pass legal muster. A decision could come soon, since the court is hearing the case on an expedited basis. Yet even if justices rule against the duties, implemented by President Donald Trump on a country-by-country basis, analysts argue there’s no guarantee that things will return to normal for consumers and businesses. “The removal of [country-specific] tariffs would open the door for trade policy uncertainty to rise again,” analysts with Oxford Economics research group said in a note published Tuesday. That uncertainty, the note added, could end up delaying hiring and business investment — something that could further drag down an already-ailing labor market. The tariffs are being challenged by five small businesses that believe Trump illegally used emergency powers to bypass Congress and impose the duties. The businesses, which include a wine importer, a pipe and fittings company, and a bicycle importing firm, allege they are facing significant financial burdens as a result of the tariffs. “Genova Pipe is dependent on imports to continue its manufacturing operations,” attorneys for the businesses said in their suit, referring to the fittings firm. “The tariffs will directly increase the cost of raw materials, manufacturing equipment, and resale goods imported from abroad by Genova Pipe.” Other businesses have also said tariffs are hurting them. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index held in contraction territory for the eighth-straight month — with many respondents to its survey saying tariffs are weighing on their outlooks. “Tariffs continue to be a large impact to our business,” an unidentified machinery firm said in the survey. “The products we import are not readily manufactured in the U.S., so attempts to reshore have been unsuccessful. Overall, prices on all products have gone up, some significantly.” Yet there remains debate about the direct impact of the tariffs so far, many of which were enacted in August. Analysts with Bank of America found that prices for 101 commonly purchased items on Walmart.com had increased an average of roughly 3.4% from April to October — with toys in particular, many of which are made in China, seeing the biggest hit. However, they said the effect on consumers has been less than what one would expect if the costs of tariffs were being fully passed through to consumers. Businesses, they said, seem to be absorbing significant levels of the costs. In a statement to NBC News, the Yale Budget Lab, a policy think tank, likewise said that the effects of the tariffs “have been somewhat muted so far.” Still, it added, tariffs are weighing on the economy in other ways. “There’s no clear evidence that increased tariffs are responsible for the slowdown in job growth seen in recent months, although broader policy uncertainty is undoubtedly playing a role,” the lab said. “In general, we would expect to see the effects of tariffs to phase in over time as businesses modify their decisions to hire and/or invest.” While large and small companies alike have been facing cost pressures from tariffs, smaller ones have likely taken an outsize hit. Bigger companies have more capital and resources to help them mitigate higher costs. Small businesses, though, were more likely to fall into a category of firms facing import tariff increases exceeding 25 percentage points, according to an August study by the Atlanta Federal Reserve. “Small importers may be relatively more constrained in their ability to weather higher trade costs or switch suppliers, and, as a result, might experience defaults and bankruptcies,” the analysis found. A ruling against the tariffs would likely lower the cost burden to businesses and consumers. But the economy could face turmoil if the court demands the administration refund tariff revenues. Country-specific duties totaled approximately $89 billion through August, according to government data. In addition to the logistical challenge of sending refund checks to whoever paid the duties to U.S. officials, some analysts believe refunds could heat up economic activity — albeit with risks. A ruling against Trump may end up boosting consumer inflation pressures, Bank of America analysts said in a note published last week. The Trump administration has already signaled it would attempt to use different legal authorities to reimpose the duties. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested Trump would tap another statute, established in 1930, that would allow him to impose tariffs of up to 50% on countries that discriminate against U.S. commerce. “You should assume that they’re here to stay,” Bessent said in an interview in September. The Oxford Economics analysts, meanwhile, have said they would be “unlikely to change our broader outlook for tariffs” even if the court decides against Trump. Bessent, along with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, attended the Supreme Court arguments Wednesday. Investors appeared to applaud the court's apparent skepticism, sending stocks higher. Still, some on Wall Street cautioned that no particular decision is certain. “There were still enough arguments on both sides for it to go either way, and much can still change during the Justices’ closed-door deliberative process,” wrote Sarah Bianchi, Evercore’s chief strategist of international political affairs.",left

"Coffee tariffs have been lifted, but some Portland cafés and roasters are still waiting for relief As one of America's coffee capitals, Portland, Oregon, has grounds for worry: coffee prices have soared to historic highs. ""We have bags of coffee on our menu that are $28.50. That's a lot of money for a bag of coffee,"" said Laila Ghambari, owner of Guilder Coffee Company, a café that sells specialty coffee. Ghambari and her brothers practically grew up inside an espresso machine. Her father owned a coffee shop, and Ghambari became the U.S. barista champion in 2014. Now, she's a small business owner grappling with the expense of tariffs, which are still impacting her business even though coffee and other products were granted an exemption last month. ""Any coffee that's already landed in the United States is still subject to the tariff,"" Ghambari said. Coffee prices were already high due to supply and demand pressures for premium beans along with climate issues, especially crop-killing frost. The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee hit a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In December 2019, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, one pound of ground coffee cost a little over $4. And in August, retail coffee prices in the U.S. had jumped 20.9% from the previous year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — the sharpest increase in nearly three decades. Then, back in April, the U.S. imposed a so-called reciprocal tariff of 10% on coffee-producing countries. Ghambari said it cost her roughly fifty cents a bag. Christopher Hendon, a chemistry professor at the University of Oregon known as ""Dr. Coffee,"" studies the global industry and said the tariffs cost independent coffee operators more than consumers. ""[The consumer is] probably not feeling it,"" Hendon said. ""You might not care today, because the price didn't change all that much, but you might care if your local café disappears."" Charlie Wicker's company, Trailhead Coffee Roasters, roasts green beans into brown ones. Tariffs hit him hard. ""I had to lay off the two full-time employees. So now it's down to just myself and one part-time employee,"" Wicker said, adding, ""The fact that we're still standing is a function of having a little bit of savings to keep the lights on."" Despite the reversal that lifted tariffs on coffee, relief will take time because coffee roasters and cafés typically order beans months in advance. Ghambari said it won't be until February when the first import of tariff-free coffees will land in her warehouse. For Wicker, who delivers to cafés, lifting those tariffs could be the coffee break he needs.",left
"Trump says he'll issue $2,000 tariff dividend to all except 'high-income people' The president says the country is now wealthy because of his tariff policies. President Donald Trump on Sunday claimed that a “dividend of at least $2000 a person” will be paid to all Americans except for “high-income people,” saying the country is now wealthy as a result of his tariff policies. “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k’s are Highest EVER,” the president wrote. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” he added. In an interview on ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he had not spoken with Trump about the proposed dividend. Calling opponents to tariffs ""fools,"" Trump claimed ""A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone."" ""The $2,000 dividend could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways, George,"" Bessent told anchor George Stephanopoulos. ""You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda -- you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans."" This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.",left
"Supreme Court prepares to weigh tariffs fight in test of Trump's power Washington — For Lindsay Hagerman, the past few months have felt tumultuous. As the co-owner of the Pennsylvania-based RainCaper, which sells art-inspired travel accessories and gifts, Hagerman has found herself questioning her pricing strategy while watching tariffs on goods imported from China see-saw from 10% to 20% to 145% — and then back down again. ""Is it temporary? Is this the new normal? You're struggling with how do we price — do we change prices now? Wait? I don't want to gouge people,"" Hagerman told CBS News. ""That's not how you do good business. But I also need to cover expenses."" RainCaper, which Hagerman founded with her mother nearly a decade ago, sells rain capes, travel accessories, umbrellas, scarves, shawls and drinkware to boutiques, museum stores, retailers and directly to consumers through its website. Her company imports umbrellas and rain capes made from a waterproof fabric from China, and neither can be made in the U.S., Hagerman said. As a result, RainCaper has found itself on the front lines of President Trump's trade war, which relies heavily on tariffs. But Hagerman and small business owners across the U.S. could see some stability in the coming weeks, with the Supreme Court set to consider Wednesday whether Mr. Trump has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on nearly every country under a federal emergency powers law. Lower courts have ruled his most sweeping duties are illegal, and a decision from the Supreme Court upholding those decisions could deal a blow to the president's efforts to use tariffs as leverage in negotiations with foreign countries and to pressure U.S. companies to invest in domestic manufacturing. But a ruling from the high court against Mr. Trump, who appointed three of the justices, could also have significant implications for presidential power. Since he announced the sweeping global tariffs earlier this year, many small businesses have had to devote time and resources to keeping up with the fast-changing fluctuations in the tariff rates and countries targeted, all while making determinations about how to respond to the increased costs of importing the components needed for their products. At RainCaper, Hagerman has trimmed expenses and laid off two of its seven employees who were working in operations and customer service, she said. She also explored manufacturing outside of China because of the levies, though Hagerman ultimately decided against it in part because of the significant investment it would require. And as a military spouse whose husband is out of state, she said making trips to countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia to look at other potential facilities wasn't possible. ""When the administration is saying we're bringing trillions into the economy and saying China is paying these tariffs, Brazil is paying these tariffs, it's just not true,"" Hagerman said. ""Tariffs are borne by the importer. I'm the importer."" A ""stark choice"" for the Supreme Court Mr. Trump has invoked a federal law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose two different sets of tariffs through a series of executive orders. The first set a baseline rate of 10% on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as well as higher reciprocal tariffs on more than 50 countries; and the second targeted China, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of varying rates. In his executive orders, the president declared trade deficits and the flood of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. as national emergencies, which unlocked IEEPA's powers. The law authorizes the president to ""regulate … importation"" to deal with ""any unusual and extraordinary threat"" to national security, foreign policy or the U.S. economy, which he said trade imbalances and drug trafficking constitute. Since Mr. Trump announced the tariffs in February and April — on what he called ""Liberation Day"" — the administration has reached trade deals with 10 countries and the European Union, and said it is ""actively negotiating"" with more foreign nations. But soon after the president announced the tariffs, two sets of small businesses and a group of 12 states filed lawsuits arguing that IEEPA doesn't authorize the sweeping duties. Lower courts have ruled against the administration, finding that IEEPA doesn't give the president the power to unilaterally impose the global and trafficking tariffs. In one of the cases, involving a group of five small businesses and Democratic officials from 12 states, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7-4 that many of the president's levies are illegal. But the Federal Circuit set aside a lower court's injunction, which has allowed the Trump administration to keep collecting the global and trafficking tariffs for now. Mr. Trump has also continued to rely on IEEPA to impose new levies or tweak existing rates, including raising Canadian tariffs to 35%, though many of its goods are exempt, imposing an additional 40% duty on Brazil and threatening China with an additional 100% duty, though the president has since walked that back. Mr. Trump then announced last week after a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would be reducing the tariffs on goods imported from China. The Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to uphold the levies, arguing that Congress has long given the president broad authority to impose tariffs to address emergencies. Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing that IEEPA is a continuation of that tradition because it gives the president the power to ""regulate … importation."" Sauer also asserted that the tariffs are an exercise of Mr. Trump's power over national security and foreign affairs, and argued courts should give deference to his determination that the duties are best suited for addressing national emergencies arising from trade deficits and drug trafficking. Invalidating those levies, he said, would have ""catastrophic consequences"" for national security, foreign policy and the economy. ""To the President, these cases present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation,"" Sauer wrote. Mr. Trump has called the case ""one of the most important in the history of the country"" and had said he planned to attend the arguments in-person. But he reversed course Sunday, writing on social media that he did ""not want to distract from the importance of this decision."" Lawyers for the small businesses told the high court in papers that Mr. Trump's tariffs have significant economic consequences. An analysis from the Tax Foundation found the duties will impose $1.7 trillion in new taxes on Americans by 2035, reduce GDP growth by 0.7% per year, and reduce income by 1.1% in 2026. No president has used IEEPA to levy tariffs — until now — and the law makes no mention of that word or others like it. Neal Katyal, who will argue on behalf of the small businesses before the Supreme Court, warned in filings that the Trump administration's interpretation of IEEPA is a ""breathtaking assertion"" of power that requires explicit authorization from Congress. If the Supreme Court agrees with Mr. Trump that the power to tax is found in IEEPA through the phrase ""regulate … importation,"" then ""the president, empowered by a supercharged U.S. Code, could tax everything from autos to zoos,"" Katyal wrote in a filing. ""The government's theory is really that the president has the ability to impose sales taxes, property taxes, use taxes, essentially a wealth tax under IEEPA,"" Timothy Meyer, an expert in international law at Duke Law, told CBS News. ""The justices are going to have to confront this really extraordinary breadth of the government's argument."" The plaintiffs also argued that trade deficits hardly constitute an ""unusual and extraordinary threat,"" as imbalances have lasted for five decades, and Mr. Trump himself has described them as ""persistent."" Additionally, the power to levy taxes and duties rests squarely with Congress, and any delegations of that power have been ""explicit and strictly limited,"" they said. And indeed, there are numerous other statutes in which Congress has delegated its tariffing power — some of which have been used by Mr. Trump — though they put constraints on the president. ""The reason that President Trump likes IEEPA is because unlike every other statute that delegates to the president the authority to impose tariffs, IEEPA requires no process before the president can act, requires no investigation, no fact-finding other than an unreviewable declaration of a national emergency, and it places no limits on what the president can do in terms of the amount of the duty or the length of time that they can remain in place,"" Meyer said. He continued: ""The reason it doesn't do any of those things is because it doesn't mention duties at all, so it seems pretty likely that Congress did not intend to include substantial power to impose tariffs in the statute."" Jeffrey Bialos, a partner at Eversheds Sutherland who specializes in international law, predicted that if Mr. Trump prevails before the Supreme Court, future administrations would likely use IEEPA's authority to set out broad tariffs rather than look to other authorities that are more narrow and impose certain requirements. ""This isn't foreign affairs. It's a question of what is permissible to delegate under Article I Section 8, and what kind of authority you need,"" Bialos said. ""Did Congress intend to allow the president to throw out the entire tariff code of the United States? That's the import of what was done here."" A test of presidential authority Mr. Trump has spent his first months back in the White House flexing his presidential authority in other ways, including through his firings of executive branch officials and the withholding of $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress. When those cases made their way to the Supreme Court in their early stages, the conservative justices have in most instances allowed the Trump administration to temporarily enforce certain policies while proceedings in the lower courts continue. In the dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs, the Supreme Court will weigh the legal merits of the case, something it has not yet done in the others. But the court battle, like those others, could have implications for the power the president is seeking to assert. ""What the Supreme Court is really deciding here is whether or not to give the administration a free pass any time it's able to connect some sort of policy initiative to some sort of international dimension,"" Meyer said. ""If you create a system in which you get deference if you can characterize something as a foreign affairs issue, but there's no deference if it's done by an administrative agency pursuing some sort of statutory delegation, then the administration will just do as much as it can through emergency and international affairs powers."" The Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad assertions of executive authority on issues of major political and economic significance when Congress has not spoken clearly, invoking what's called the major questions doctrine to invalidate former President Joe Biden's plan to wipe away more than $400 billion in student loan debt and block an eviction moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic. That legal principle is raised in the battle over his tariffs, though the Trump administration argues that it doesn't apply to matters of national security and foreign policy. But lawyers for the small businesses counter that tariffs are a tax on the American people, and the Constitution has vested the taxing power in Congress. ""Taxing American citizens is not national security or foreign policy, and the tariffs are paid by Emily Ley and other ordinary Americans,"" said Mark Chenoweth, president and chief legal officer at the New Civil Liberties Alliance. The organization is representing a Pensacola-based stationary company and its CEO, Emily Ley, in a different challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs. That case is not before the Supreme Court. ""To argue that unilateral taxation of American citizens is national security or foreign policy is incorrect,"" Chenoweth said. ""We fought a Revolutionary War over the idea of taxation without representation, and that's what this would be if the president can unilaterally raise taxes on American citizens."" A ""mass extinction"" of small businesses While lower courts have agreed that Mr. Trump's global and trafficking tariffs are illegal, the government has continued to collect the duties as the Supreme Court weighs the cases. For Julie Robbins, CEO of EarthQuaker Devices, that has meant paying nearly $40,000 in levies through the end of October. The family-owned company makes guitar pedals and manufactures its products in Akron, Ohio. EarthQuaker's product line includes 50 pedals that require more than 900 unique components that it sources from 15 different countries, including Mexico, Portugal, Poland, Ukraine and several in Asia. To assist with logistics, Robbins said EarthQuaker works with wholesalers that vet overseas manufacturers and source the mechanical and electrical components needed for its pedals. The wholesalers are paying the tariffs when the items arrive at U.S. ports and then pass along a portion of the duties to EarthQuaker, she said. Upon hearing Mr. Trump would be imposing his sweeping levies, one of Robbins' first moves was to search for domestic suppliers. She ultimately found they either don't exist for the parts that go into EarthQuaker's guitar pedals or they charge significantly more than her international sources. Plus, breaking off long-held relationships with overseas suppliers would be risky and disrupt a supply chain that took years to perfect, she said, since there were no guarantees other manufacturers or their products would be reliable. ""It's taken us 20 years to develop this supply chain,"" she said. ""It's not something that happened overnight and so in order to redo it, I can't see it happening."" Robbins said EarthQuaker could save money by having their pedals made in-full overseas, rather than having the parts shipped to the U.S. and the pedals assembled at its production facilities in Ohio. But doing that wouldn't align with the company's values of keeping well-paying jobs in Akron, a city that was once known as the ""Rubber Capital of the World"" for its production of rubber products. ""When people try to oversimplify and say you should be manufacturing in the United States, we are manufacturing in the United States, but you can't make the raw materials in the U.S.,"" Robbins said. EarthQuaker doesn't have deep-pocketed investors and has eroded its cash cushion as it has navigated the whiplash of changing tariff rates, she said. The company also opted not to replace employees that have left in recent months, and it pulled two open positions. ""My concern is there's just going to be this mass extinction of small business,"" Robbins said. ""It's not sustainable."" Cephalofair Games, a California-based company that designs and publishes board games, has paid more than $144,000 in new tariffs over the past few months, according to its chief operating officer, Price Johnson. In July, Cephalofair informed its customers it would be adding ""tariff surcharges"" as a result of the import taxes and has increased the prices of its products. It has also reduced the salaries of staff and furloughed workers. The company manufactures its games in China and has had to make adjustments to product runs in response to the tariffs. Johnson told CBS News that a run of 7,000 units is nearly completed, but instead of bringing it into the U.S., the company will instead send its games to Europe, the United Kingdom and Australia. In the meantime, Johnson said the company continues to design and develop new games, but is waiting to hear from the Supreme Court before moving forward with manufacturing. Cephalofair wasn't impacted by tariffs during the first administration and had been preparing for tariffs on Chinese imports of between 10% and 15%, Johnson said. But these days, he and his colleagues have taken to watching Mr. Trump's social media feed for tariff-related announcements. The uncertainty has ""removed any ability for us to plan or rely on what we as importers can operate on,"" Johnson said. ""We have to plan on not being able to plan or trust what U.S. policy is surrounding trade.""",left

"The White House said Tuesday it would follow through on plans to partially fund critical food aid during the government shutdown, despite President Donald Trump’s threat just hours earlier that he would withhold the federal assistance. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that she had spoken with Trump and that the administration would be “fully complying” with a court order to keep some Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits flowing. “We’re getting that partial payment out the door as much as we can and as quickly as we can,” Leavitt said of the program, which is more commonly known as SNAP or food stamps. Trump sparked widespread confusion earlier Tuesday when he appeared to abruptly reverse course on the administration’s funding plan, writing on Truth Social that SNAP “will be given only when those Radical Left Democrats open up the government, which they can easily do, and not before!” That move would have left millions of people without the monthly federal assistance they rely on to purchase food and sparked a fresh legal showdown. More than two dozen states and a coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses sued in separate cases last week to force the administration to keep at least some of the aid flowing. “This is immoral. See you in court,” Skye Perryman, the CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organization involved in the coalition’s lawsuit that also sought continuation of the SNAP benefits, wrote on X in response to Trump’s post. The administration is tapping into a roughly $5 billion contingency fund to support partial benefits into November. The Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, issued guidance earlier Tuesday to states for distributing the partial payments. Nearly 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits, which amount to roughly $350 per household per month on average when paid out in full. The USDA last month said it could not pay November’s benefits, citing concerns over whether it could legally use the contingency fund or move money from other accounts. But the courts ruled that the government must tap into the contingency fund to pay partial benefits and could shift other money to enable it to fully pay the more than $8 billion in benefits, as well as other costs. And Trump himself previously indicated he had instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it could legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,” he wrote Friday. The administration ultimately opted to use the contingency fund to pay out partial benefits. Varying benefit amounts Not everyone will receive half their benefit amount this month, according to the USDA guidance issued to states on Tuesday. Those who receive the maximum monthly allotment – which in most of the country is $994 for a family of four – will receive half that amount. And one and two person households who receive the minimum monthly benefit will get $12, instead of the usual $24. But those in between will likely see less than half of their usual allotment, with the amount depending on their household size and income, according to Stacy Dean, who ran the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service, which oversees SNAP, during the Biden administration. States will have to recalculate these recipients’ benefit amount based on the reduced maximum allotment tables that USDA issued in its guidance, which is a faster way to get the payments out the door than to cut all recipients’ assistance in half. (States already base SNAP benefits on the agency’s maximum allotment tables.) Push to provide full benefits A federal judge in Rhode Island, meanwhile, scheduled a Thursday hearing to consider a fresh request for an order requiring the Trump administration to provide full food stamp benefits for November. The hearing before US District Judge John McConnell will be the latest episode in a dramatic showdown over the benefits that is playing out in two federal courts. After the government notified McConnell of its plans on Monday that it would provide only partial SNAP benefits, the coalition that brought the legal challenge pressed the judge to intervene yet again, arguing USDA’s choice did not comport with the requirements of his order last week. The plaintiffs are asking the judge to issue a new order that would tap into unused tariff funds meant for child nutrition programs to provide SNAP benefits for November. As part of that bid, they seized on Trump’s social media post in their lawsuit challenging the decision not to fully fund SNAP. “In addition to threatening defiance of the Court’s order, the post makes plain what Plaintiffs explained in their motion to enforce: Defendants are withholding SNAP benefits from individuals and families who need vital food assistance for partisan political gain,” attorneys for the coalition wrote in court papers. But the USDA told the court Monday that it would not utilize the tariff revenue because it would endanger the nation’s free and reduced-price school meals program, which serves about 29 million children a day. (The agency has transferred $750 million in tariff revenue to the WIC food assistance program for pregnant women, new moms and young children.) Thursday’s hearing is set for 3:30 p.m. ET.

"AIB has upgraded its forecasts for the Irish economy for this year and next as it has proven to be more resilient than expected against the backdrop of the Trump administration’s trade tariffs and general global uncertainty. The bank now sees the domestic economy – measured by modified domestic demand, which seeks to strip out the effects of multinationals operating in the State – expanding by 3.2 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent in 2026, according to its latest economic outlook. That is up from estimates of 2.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively, published in May, a month after US president Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs plan, which he subsequently rowed back on. “The global macro backdrop has improved since our last Economic Outlook in May 2025. The uncertainty created by the dramatic shift in US trade policy in April is still elevated, but the EU-US trade deal has also brought some predictability for exporters,” said AIB chief economist David McNamara. “Amid this volatility, the Irish economy has been robust, but there are some signs of cooling, particularly in the labour market.” Underpinning the Irish forecast is an assumption that US tariffs will remain, in effective terms, below the headline 15 per cent rate agreed between Washington and the European Union in July to end months of uncertainty. This is because of opt-outs for specific sectors such as generic pharmaceuticals, aircraft parts, and others, AIB noted. READ MORE [ Irish manufacturing growth at 10-month low, data showOpens in new window ] AIB sees Irish gross domestic product (GDP), a wider measure of the economy, growing 9.1 per cent in 2025 and 3.8 per cent in 2026. “Irish GDP remains a volatile gauge of activity, as evidenced by the sharp swings in growth in recent quarters, but the globalised nature of Ireland’s GDP also reveals the impact of tariff front-running in the global economy,” the report said. In the first half of 2025, GDP grew by an enormous 18 per cent year on year, driven almost entirely by activity and exports from Ireland’s multinational sector as companies sought to get ahead of expected tariffs. However, geopolitical uncertainty remains high and because of that consumer spending and business investment growth in Ireland are still expected to cool going into 2026, according to AIB. AIB sees the labour market continuing to grow, but given the expected easing in economic growth next year, it expects a more modest expansion in employment. Following a 2.7 per cent rise in 2024 it sees employment growth slowing to 2.1 per cent in 2025 and 1.7 per cent in 2026. The bank said that an “emerging upside risk” for the economy is the rapid development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This has the potential to significantly boost private-sector investment in the short term. “The development and deployment of AI is moving at a rapid pace, boosting equity markets and driving an exceptional investment surge by technology companies,” it said. “While this investment cycle is now boosting GDP, particularly in the US, the long-term productivity growth benefits remain uncertain.”",left
"Saudi Arabia’s crown prince visits the White House for the first time since the killing of a journalist. The House is set to vote to compel the Justice Department to release all the Epstein files. And taps are running dry in Tehran as a water crisis forces Iran to consider evacuating its capital. Here's what to know today. Saudi crown prince visits U.S. after diplomatic isolation Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, will be taking a huge step toward rejoining the international community when he meets President Donald Trump at the White House today. Trump has defended the Saudi government despite the CIA concluding that the-40 year-old leader ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was a frequent critic of bin Salman, in 2018. Khashoggi's murder made bin Salman an international pariah in the years that followed. The prince said in 2019 that he took ""full responsibility"" for the killing since it happened on his watch, but denied ordering it. Saudi officials have said Khashoggi's killing was the work of a rogue Saudi security and intelligence officials. Trump and Bin Salman are expected to sign economic and defense agreements, a White House official told NBC News. Even before the Crown Prince had set foot in the U.S, Trump confirmed during an Oval Office event that he would be willing to sign off on the sale of F-35 stealth fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, a move that could potentially shift the balance of power in the Middle East. The possibility of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel will be a key part of the talks, according to the White House official. The official said that Trump ""hopes"" the kingdom will soon join the Abraham Accords, the 2020 U.S.-brokered agreement that led to a number of regional countries establishing formal diplomatic ties with Israel, though analysts are skeptical about a breakthrough. Trump has long touted his deal-making abilities and, according to a senior administration official, there are a number of deals expected to be announced, including a multi-billion-dollar Saudi investment in America's AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge via dozens of targeted investments. The deals come as critics have raised questions about Trump's affinity for mixing personal business and diplomacy. Trump's properties have for years hosted tournaments for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. ""There’s some massive ethical questions in here,"" said Andrew Leber, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has done extensive research on Saudi Arabia. ""It’s very obvious that all of the Gulf states have realized that the way you get to Trump is to find some way to enrich his family members, enrich his friends, promise to enrich them down the line."" House poised to pass a bill to force the release of the Epstein files The Republican-led House is poised to vote overwhelmingly today for legislation to compel the Justice Department to release all of its records related to its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The bipartisan duo who co-authored the legislation — Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna — are working to secure a veto-proof majority in the House and are predicting as many as 100 Republicans could vote yes. Trump and the White House had worked behind the scenes to stop the effort, trying to pressure a handful of GOP women to drop off the Epstein petition. But with the writing on the wall, Trump abruptly reversed course and posted he was endorsing the bill. Trump told reporters he would sign the legislation should it reach his desk. One Trump ally in the House told NBC News that Republicans have been widely frustrated with the White House's dismissive handling of the Epstein saga and privately encouraged them to shift strategy. Larry Summers, who served as treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, said yesterday that he will be stepping back from public commitments following the recent publication of his correspondence with Epstein.

A dangerous drought Iranian taps are running dry in the midst of a severe water crisis and the government is getting desperate. There are posters around Tehran urging residents to conserve water and now some senior officials are suggesting punishing citizens who don't listen. The minister of energy warned last week that he is coming up with a plan to cut electricity to households that are still filling up their pools. Analysts who talked to NBC News pointed to a prolonged drought along with years of overconsumption, an inefficient agricultural sector and mismanagement as the main reasons for the crisis. Ordinary Iranians told us that this crisis has hit at a particularly hard time as the country's economy is in bad shape and many people are struggling to make ends meet.

"Seasonal retail jobs are set to drop to lowest level in 15 years Retailers are betting they can handle the holiday shopping rush with fewer additional workers. From Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, retail stores are expected to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, down from the 442,000 seasonal hires companies brought on last year, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization. That would mark the lowest level of seasonal retail hiring in 15 years, according to the NRF. At the same time, the organization expects holiday sales to hit a record, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time as spending rises between 3.7% to 4.2%. The decline in expected seasonal hiring comes as the broader labor market is showing signs of strain, with some businesses across the nation holding off on adding new workers. At the same time, layoffs are accelerating, with job cuts this year through October rising to their highest levels since 2020. The group's hiring expectations ""reflect the softening and slowing labor market,"" NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said in a Thursday press briefing. ""But nevertheless, we are confident that retailers will be prepared to meet consumers with the prices, with the goods, and the convenient savings and value they're looking for this holiday season,"" he added. Despite diminished consumer sentiment, holiday spending is projected to hold up as shoppers continue to prioritize the season's celebrations over other purchases, he said. ""People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it and we think that's going to happen again this year,"" Mathews noted. To be sure, consumers are expressing concern about rising prices, with inflation ticking higher in recent months due partly to wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Retailers are handing some of those tariff costs to shoppers, with a Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis analysis finding that companies passed about one-third of the new import duties onto consumers from May through July. ""All signals are consumers continue to be concerned about inflation and rising prices,"" NRF senior economist Jack Kleinhenz said during the press briefing. ""Despite these concerns, I believe consumers are still willing to spend, even though their sentiment is at very low levels."" While retailers are planning fewer seasonal hires this year, some have added additional staff in the past few years, which could help compensate, NRF economists added. ""You might see less hiring, but we are seeing less firing in the retail industry,"" Matthews said. ""Those two are running neck and neck."" For example, Target said it's asking current retail employees if they want to pick up additional shifts during the holidays before adding new seasonal hires.",left
"President Donald Trump’s advisers have had conversations about him traveling the country to give economy-focused speeches as they privately weigh a number of strategies to improve his standing on the issue, administration officials told CNN. Trump’s advisers acknowledge that they have an affordability problem that the president has bristled at in public: Americans’ outlook on the economy is dour, and the administration’s efforts to ease their financial anxieties aren’t resonating. “You can’t convince people that their experience, what they’re feeling at home, isn’t reality,” one of the officials said. White House officials have advised the president not to brush away or outright dismiss that Americans are feeling squeezed by rising prices, they said. They have been actively putting “policy time” — as one of the officials characterized it — on Trump’s schedule with the goal of accelerating the administration’s efforts to tackle inflation. While Trump has talked extensively about affordability in recent days, he has often downplayed the strain Americans are feeling, suggesting in a Fox News interview on Monday that polls capturing Americans’ economic anxiety are “fake.” One of the strategies being discussed in the West Wing is for Trump to turn much of his attention to his domestic agenda. That includes ramping up his domestic travel, the officials said, and pulling back on his international trips. As the holidays draw near, there’s also a push to coordinate new messaging on what the administration is doing to help lower costs. Two key factors last week — Democratic victories in Tuesday’s elections and the mounting pain of the record-long government shutdown — initially set off alarm bells, not only in the White House but in the Oval Office directly, about the magnitude of the issue, the officials said. The discussions also come as Trump has been criticized, including by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of focusing more on his foreign policy and less on domestic concerns, though the president dismissed that notion on Monday. “I have to view the presidency as a worldwide situation, not locally,” Trump said, responding to the criticism that he was too busy meeting with foreign leaders. “But with all of that, I passed a great big beautiful bill, which is the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.” The president, meanwhile, has been personally frustrated with Americans’ perception of his administration’s handling of the economy and the media’s coverage of it. “The president gets it. He knows this is an issue,” a senior White House official said. “But he’s frustrated he’s not getting credit for what he’s doing,” pointing to energy deregulations and the extension of his 2017 tax cuts. Trump acknowledged that frustration last week, just hours after Democrats walked away with major wins in New Jersey, Virginia, New York City and California. “I tell Republicans, you want to win elections, you got to talk about these facts,” he told a financial conference in Miami, concluding that his party has been too quiet about the economic accomplishments of his term so far. “You know, it’s really easy to win elections when you talk about the facts.” Earlier in the day, Trump castigated Senate Republicans, arguing they were getting “killed” politically by the government shutdown, which public polling showed Americans blaming more on the GOP and Trump than on Democrats. It appears the shutdown could be over by week’s end, but officials argue that it has contributed to burgeoning concerns about the cost of living in the US. (The shutdown also exposed another potential political liability for the GOP in the form of rising health care premiums, which the party will be forced to grapple with after this week’s votes to reopen the government.) ‘We have the greatest economy ever’ Trump’s public comments on the economy have at times been reminiscent of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, who was widely seen as out of touch for initially downplaying the threat of inflation. Pressed during Monday’s Fox News interview about why Americans say they’re down on the economy if he’s accomplished as much as he says he has to lower prices, Trump questioned the premise. “I don’t know that they are saying that. I think polls are fake,” Trump said. “We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.” He used the opportunity to point to the revenue being generated from his tariff policies. (In a CNN poll released last week, 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” That number topped out at 58% under Biden in CNN polling.) Some of the president’s defensive messaging has come from what he’s being told by his advisers, who have argued that his financial policies are working but need time to settle in, two of the officials said. They’ve also cautioned that while his tariffs have caused a temporary ripple in the economy, those hurdles will be smoothed out by the 2026 midterms. “President Trump inherited the worst affordability crisis in modern American history, and in less than ten months, he stopped inflation in its tracks,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement. “The President’s pro-growth policies of deregulation and energy independence are bringing down gas prices, food prices, and inflation — and Americans will continue to benefit. Trust in Trump — he created the greatest economy in his first term and he is doing it again in his second term.” Yet despite Trump’s grandiose claims about ushering in the best economy in history and knocking Democrats’ affordability message as a “con job,” he’s also taken steps in recent days to try to make his mark on the issue. He’s floated $2,000 tariff rebate checks to lower- and middle-income Americans, gone after meatpacking companies he’s accused of jacking up prices, and even raised the idea of a 50-year mortgage (a proposal that stemmed from Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte and one that many White House officials are not on board with). All of those moves appear to be an indication of how the president is seeing the affordability issue resonate, even as he attempts to brush it off in another breath. And while some in the White House see the new fixation on affordability as an overreaction to last week’s elections and shutdown anxiety, administration officials also want to avoid Biden’s mistakes, which means taking Americans’ perceptions about the economy seriously — and doing something about it. With critical midterms that will shape the rest of Trump’s term now less than a year away, they don’t see time to waste.",left
"Tea tariffs once sparked a revolution. Now they are creating angst President Donald Trump’s decision to back down from some tariffs is being celebrated by tea importers, who say the levies have been devastating this year NEW YORK -- A tax on tea once sparked rebellion. This time, it’s just causing headaches. Importers of the prized leaves have watched costs climb, orders stall and margins shrink under the weight of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Now, even after Trump has given them a reprieve, tea traders say it won’t immediately undo the damage. “It took a while to work its way through the system, these tariffs, and it will take a while for it to work its way out of the system,” says Bruce Richardson, a celebrated tea master, tea historian and purveyor of teas at his shop, Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, in Danville, Kentucky. “That tariffed tea is still working its way out of our warehouses.” While a handful of bigger firms are behind the biggest supermarket brands, the premium tea market is largely the work of smaller businesses, from family farms to specialty importers to a web of little tea shops, tea rooms and tea cafes across the U.S. Amid an onslaught of tariffs, they have become showcases for the levies’ effects. On their shelves, selection has narrowed, with some teas now missing because they’re no longer viable products to stock with steep levies on top. In their warehouses, managers are consumed with uncertainty and operational headaches, including calculating what a blend really costs, with ingredients from multiple countries on a roller coaster of tariffs. And in backrooms where the wafting scent of fresh tea permeates, owners have been forced to put off job postings, raises, advertising and other investments so they can have cash available to pay duties when their containers arrive at U.S. ports. “If I were to add up all the money I’ve spent on tariffs that weren’t there a year ago, it could equal a new employee,” says Hartley Johnson, who owns the Mark T. Wendell Tea Company in Acton, Massachusetts. Johnson’s prices used to stay static for a year or longer. He ate the tariff costs before being forced to respond. His most popular tea, a smoky Taiwanese one called Hu-Kwa, has steadily risen from $26 to $46 a pound. He knows some customers are reconsidering. “Where is that tipping point?” Johnson asks. “I’m kind of finding that tipping point is happening now.” Though Trump backed off some tariffs on agricultural products last week, many in the tea trade are wary of celebrating too soon and caution tea drinkers shouldn’t either. Much of next year’s supply has already been imported and tariffed and the full impact of those duties may not have fully spilled downhill. Meantime, other tariff-driven price hikes persist. All sorts of other products tea businesses import, from teapots to infusers, remain subject to levies, and costs for some American-made items, like tins for packaging, have spiked because they rely on foreign materials. “The canisters, the bamboo boxes, the matcha whisks, everything that we import, everything that we sell has been affected by tariffs,” says Gilbert Tsang, owner of MEM Tea Imports in Wakefield, Massachusetts. Though globally, tea reigns supreme, imbibed more than anything but water, it has long been overshadowed by coffee in the U.S. Still, tea is entwined in American history from the very beginning, even before colonists angry with tariffs dumped tons of it in Boston Harbor. Boston may run on Dunkin’ today, but it was born on tea. The 1773 revolt that became known as the Boston Tea Party rose out of the British Parliament’s implementation of tea tariffs on colonists, who rejected taxation without representation in government. After an independent United States was born, one of the new government’s first major acts, the Tariff Act of 1789, ironically set in law import taxes on a range of products including tea. In time, though, trade policy came to include carve-outs for many products Americans rely on but don’t produce. For more than 150 years, most tea has passed through U.S. ports with little to no duties. That began to change in Trump’s first term with his hardline approach to China. But nothing compared to what came with his return to the White House. In July, the most recent month for which the U.S. International Trade Commission has tallied tariff numbers, tea was taxed at an average rate of over 12%, a huge increase from a year earlier when it was just under one-tenth of a percent. In that single month, American businesses and consumers paid more than $6 million in tea import taxes, amassing in just 31 days more tariffs than any previous full year on record. “All over again, taxation without representation,” says Richardson, an adviser to the Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum. “Our wants and needs and our voices are not being represented because Congress is avoiding the issue by simply allowing the president to act like George III.” All told, tea importers paid about $19.6 million in tariffs in the first seven months of 2025, nearly seven times as much as the same period last year. It’s all been confounding to those steeped in the world of tea, on which the U.S. depends on foreign countries for nearly all of the billions of pounds Americans brew each year. Though a number of small tea farms exist in the U.S., they can’t fill Americans’ cups for more than a few hours of the year. “We don’t have an industry and we can’t produce one overnight,” says Angela McDonald, president of the United States League of Tea Growers. Trump’s suspension of tea tariffs came too late for some businesses, including Los Angeles-based International Tea Importers Inc., for which tariffs created an untenable cash-flow crunch. “We just became over-leveraged financing not just the inventory, but also the tariffs,” says the company’s CEO, Brendan Shah. Tariffs weren’t the only thing the 35-year-old business was facing, but without them, Shah says it may have survived. “Unpredictable tariff policies,” he wrote to customers in announcing the company’s closure, “have created the final, insurmountable barrier.” ___ Matt Sedensky can be reached at msedensky@ap.org and https://x.com/sedensky",left
"Investors have been selling off the debt of US tech heavyweights, showing how jitters over Silicon Valley’s boom in spending on artificial intelligence have spilled into the bond market. A basket of bonds issued by so-called hyperscalers – companies that are building vast data centres, including Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle – has sustained a hit in recent weeks. The spread, or premium in yield that investors demand to buy the debt over Treasuries, has climbed to 0.78 percentage points, the highest level since US president Donald Trump sent markets reeling in April with his tariff plans, and up from 0.5 points in September, according to Bank of America data. The widening spread highlights how investors are increasingly concerned with the way tech groups are turning to debt markets to finance their investments in AI infrastructure. READ MORE “The important thing the market woke up to in the past two weeks is that it’s the public markets that are going to need to finance this AI boom,” said Brij Khurana, a fixed income portfolio manager at Wellington Management. JPMorgan on Monday said building AI infrastructure would cost more than $5 trillion (€4.3 trillion) and “will likely require participation from every public capital market as well as private credit, alternative capital providers and even government involvement”. The mammoth scale of investment in AI infrastructure has raised concerns about overcapacity, long-term profitability and energy demands. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta will spend more than $400 billion on data centres in 2026, on top of more than $350 billion this year. Tech groups are issuing debt at a quick rate to fund their AI expansion efforts despite having large cash hoards, which is something some investors worry could signal a shift to higher levels of leverage. “The hyperscalers collectively hold [about] $350 billion in liquid cash and investments and are expected to generate [roughly] $725 billion of operating cash flow in 2026,” JPMorgan said. “Even so, substantial new debt supply is coming to the credit markets from these high-quality issuers.” In recent weeks, Meta, Alphabet and Oracle have hit markets with blockbuster debt packages, some with maturities as long as 40 years. Meta last month forged a $27 billion private debt deal with investors, including Pimco and Blue Owl Capital, to fund development of its “Hyperion” data centre in Louisiana. It raised an additional $30 billion in bonds at the end of October, the biggest corporate bond deal since 2023. Meanwhile, Alphabet sold $25 billion of bonds in early November, $17.5 billion of which were raised in the US and $7.5 billion in Europe. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September to fund infrastructure leases such as OpenAI’s “Stargate” data centre in Abilene, Texas. Analysts noted Oracle’s debt has been hit particularly hard in recent months. An index compiled by the Financial Times tracking its debt that has been trading since before the latest bond sale has fallen almost 5 per cent since mid-September, compared with a price fall of about 1 per cent for a broad Ice Data Services basket tracking US high-grade tech debt. Oracle has about $96 billion of long-term debt, according to Bloomberg data. It has rapidly grown its debt balances as part of a series of deals to lease computing power to ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which the US software group said would generate $300 billion in revenue over the next five years. But credit rating agency Moody’s has flagged significant risks from Oracle relying on large commitments from a small number of AI companies to fund its growth. Smaller companies at the heart of the AI boom have also been hit. Data centre operator CoreWeave’s stock has fallen more than 20 per cent over the past two weeks, alongside the drop in bigger names. On Tuesday, the company’s shares were down a further 14 per cent after it lowered its forecast for annual revenue as a result of expected data centre delays. The cost to protect against a default on CoreWeave’s debt has jumped as the equity price has fallen, with the group’s five-year credit default swaps trading at 505 basis points, from below 350bp at the start of October, according to LSEG data. Some analysts argue that the decline in hyperscalers’ bonds in the wake of such large issuance is healthy. “As long as we are still pricing incremental risk, it’s a good sign. The thing I worry about is a rally on more supply rather than a sell-off,” said George Pearkes, a macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group. “We’re still in early innings in this debt cycle for AI,” he said.

"New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s victory in the governor’s election this month left behind a now-vacant congressional district — and at least 11 Democrats have lined up for the chance to fill it. Among them are a former congressman running to represent a different district from the one he once represented, a county commissioner endorsed by the sitting governor, a young progressive activist, a lieutenant governor and handful of local leaders hoping to jump into the national political scene. The crowded primary is another microlevel battle in the national debate over the future of the Democratic Party — from who its leaders are to what policies it puts at the forefront to what divides its primaries. On Friday, Gov. Phil Murphy, D-N.J., set an official date for the special election of April 16. The primary will be Feb. 5. Murphy, who has endorsed Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, told NBC News on Friday that the candidates represent “a field with a lot of talent, a lot of folks we know and admire, but Brendan stands out to me."" Most of the candidates welcome the large primary in the 11th District, despite the short runway. “I’m excited to see the widening field. You know, I think that’s evidence that our democracy is working,” Gill told NBC News on Friday. Zach Beecher, a veteran Army paratrooper who is also running in the district’s Democratic primary, told NBC News: “I think voters deserve a choice. I think the Democratic Party, I think this country broadly, does better when there’s more choice in the candidates that they have.” Beecher, like several other Democratic candidates NBC News spoke to in the district, hopes to position himself as a “political outsider.” “It’d be really hard to find any voter that would tell you that 2026 is going to likely be the year of the insider, right? I think the outsider has had a mandate in a way that’s unique,” Beecher said. “Voters want change. Voters are sick and tired of being sick and tired.” Morris Township Deputy Mayor Jeff Grayzel similarly painted himself as an outsider who can fight back against a GOP agenda, saying that's a requirement for everyone running in the primary. “I think the entry into this race, obviously, is fighting for Democrats and fighting back against Republicans and saving our democracy. I think that’s an entry point for every one of us,” Grayzel said. “What differentiates me from everybody else is I’ve actually done it,” he added, citing the fact that he been mayor and deputy mayor in the most Republican-leaning county in the district. In the recent governor’s election, Sherrill carried all three counties — Essex, Morris and Passaic — that have portions in the 11th District, but she won Morris County by the smallest margin. Anna Lee Williams, 27, a community organizer, also framed herself as an outsider. “I decided to run for office as a normal person who’s really frustrated with where our country is and where it’s been for the past 10 years,” she said. “I don’t see a consensus in Washington where I think that our representatives are working towards a future that is exciting and progressive and positive. And that led me to deciding to run for Congress.” Beecher also cited Sherrill’s success in running as a political outsider when she first won the seat in 2018. Sherrill flipped a Republican seat in favor of Democrats in what was at the time a competitive district. Since the state redrew congressional lines after the 2020 census, the district has become more favorable for Democrats. It is now rated “Solid Democrat” by the non-partisan Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. While a majority of candidates are taking the outsider lane in this primary, there are two decidedly insider candidates — Gill and former Rep. Tom Malinowski, who served the nearby 7th District from 2019 to 2023, leaving Congress after a narrow loss in 2022 to GOP now-Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Gill has touted his past work for a string of Democratic leaders in New Jersey — the late Rep. Bill Pascrell, former Rep. Steve Rothman, the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg, Sen. Cory Booker and Murphy — in an interview. “I’ve been blessed ... to have various roles, helping, working for Democrats up and down the ticket in this area. I’ve worked extensively in all three counties that this district makes up,” Gill said, adding that he was born and raised in the district and lives in it now. He also pointed to his endorsement from over 70 local leaders, including mayors throughout the district and all four Democratic state senators who serve the district. Malinowski, meanwhile, who has the endorsement of Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., told NBC News, “I’m the only Democrat running in the primary who has represented any part of this district and who has the experience to be effective.” He has faced criticism for the fact that he doesn’t live in the 11th District, though he has promised to move there if he wins the primary. After the post-2020 redistricting process, parts of Malinowski’s former 7th District were folded into the 11th District. “I work in the district. I teach at Seton Hall University, and I am motivated by a desire to get back into the fight as quickly as possible, to resume my seniority in the House as quickly as possible, so that I can be effective at a moment of great urgency,” he said. Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way said she is seriously considering running in the special election and has discussed her potential candidacy with Murphy, who she said has been encouraging. Way is also New Jersey's secretary of state, and she said her experience is what would make her the best person for the job were she to run. “I’m confident that I would be the best person for the job because no other candidate has worked as an educator, served in local government, has been a state judge and has the statewide experience of serving the great people of New Jersey,” she said. Way said her top priorities in Congress would be to address affordability and to expand access to the ballot box. She said any announcement she plans to make about her candidacy will be made soon. Insider or outsider, nearly all the candidates NBC News spoke to in the Democratic field agreed that the district needs someone who vows to lower costs and stand up to President Donald Trump’s agenda. “I would want to be focusing — laser-focused on how we’re going to help get costs under control,” Gills said, adding, “And at the same time, like, we’ve got to stand up to Trump, period.” Malinowski promising to do so if elected, saying, “I think there is, even under these circumstances, more a House can do to conduct oversight of Trump’s tariff policy.” Cammie Croft, a former Obama White House staffer who touted her contribution to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, said her goals in Congress would be to lower costs for families and end corruption in Washington, which she said is contributing to poor affordability. “This administration is the most corrupt in modern history. They are getting wealthy at our expense, and that is increasing costs for us and working families,” Croft said, adding that she would move to end stock trading in Congress and the White House if she were elected. Beecher pointed to threats Trump made Thursday against Democratic lawmakers who are veterans and former intelligence officers after they posted a video calling on military and intelligence officers to disobey illegal orders. “That is not healthy in democracy, and Trump needs to be challenged,” he said. Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett said: “Donald Trump is all about self-service, enriching himself and his cronies, while the rest of us struggle to get by. I’m about public service, and importantly, I’m ready for the fight ahead.” He added later in an interview, “The Trump administration’s policies have had a massive impact on families’ ability to get by at all economic levels in this district.” Murphy pointed to Sherrill’s recent success as a prime example of the right campaign for New Jersey, saying that “universal in any races in the near term” candidates should focus on “affordability, infrastructure, getting a Gateway project, fighting in Washington and not rolling over.”",left
"Child care expenses top the cost of rent in dozens of U.S. cities, analysis finds. See where. As child care costs soar, many Americans today find themselves paying more for a caregiver than they do for their monthly rent, according to a new analysis. Child care costs for parents with two kids exceed rental costs in 85 of the country's largest metro areas, personal finance site LendingTree found. In Omaha, Neb., Milwaukee, Wis., and Buffalo, N.Y., which have the highest child care costs in the country relative to local rents, families with an infant and a 4-year-old under care on average pay more than double the cost of their rent. Families around the U.S. pay an average of $1,282 for full-time infant care, still below the average monthly cost to rent a two-bedroom unit, LendingTree's data shows. Families with two children, on the other hand, spend an average of $2,252 per month on child care. LendingTree, which determined how child care costs stack up against rent in 100 cities. compiled its findings using data from nonprofit group Child Care Aware of America and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Exorbitant child care costs are contributing to what amounts to a crisis of affordability for many Americans, who also face rising food, housing, energy and health care costs. A survey of roughly 3,000 people released this week by Brigham Young University and Deseret News found that 7 in 10 respondents said that raising children is unaffordable, a sentiment that has surged over the last decade. One parent facing a child care crunch is New York City resident Gina Monroe, who started sending her son to day care in September. ""Having to have a household with both parents working and a grandmother that was getting too old to take care of a two-year-old, you don't have a choice,"" she told CBS News. The 42-year-old said she pays $450 a week to send her son to a day care center on nearby Long Island. That's less than her monthly mortgage payment of $3,200, but still represents one of her family's biggest expenses, she said. The financial strain of everyday life in the U.S., especially following the fierce inflation that erupted during the pandemic, has emerged as a political flashpoint this year. For example, the Trump administration has in recent weeks floated several ideas aimed at easing costs for Americans, including proposals for a $2,000 tariff rebate check and a 50-year mortgage. The administration also last week announced tariff exemptions on some popular grocery store staples, including bananas, beef and coffee, as Americans continue to battle elevated food costs. Incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani also made issues around affordability the centerpiece of his campaign, urging city officials to establish free child care for children ages 6 weeks to 5 years old. Why are child care costs soaring? Child care expenses have been rising steadily for years, and show little sign of relenting. From 2020 to 2024, costs rose nearly 30%, data from the nonprofit group Child Care Aware shows. The main driver for that surge, according to experts: a shortage of early education workers and available places at daycare centers, relative to the enormous demand for such services from families around the U.S. To that end, Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, pointed to what he described as ""child care deserts"" in some regions, where parents face a dearth of acceptable options. These are most common in low-income rural areas, which have difficulty recruiting and retaining a qualified workforce, a 2023 government report found. Where high-quality child care is in short supply, the owners can charge a premium given they face little competition, Schulz noted. Many households also don't have the benefit of having nearby family members who can help with child care responsibilities, Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families, told CBS News. ""What we actually need are policies that recognize the modern realities of working families and what the true cost of raising children in America actually is right now,"" she said.",left
"Trump administration officials are racing to reframe the president's tariff rollbacks, as critics say the White House is capitulating on its signature economic policy. Late Friday, the White House announced the president had signed an executive order exempting more than 200 food products, including bananas, beef and coffee, from the so-called reciprocal tariffs he has imposed on U.S. trading partners. The move comes as the trade duties have begun to face economic, legal and political resistance that cast doubt on their efficacy. Some two-thirds of voters who helped sweep Democrats into power in a host of races earlier this month said President Donald Trump hasn’t lived up to his promises to curb inflation and improve the economy, according to NBC News polling. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court could issue an opinion in the coming months striking down the central argument Trump has made as to why he has the power to apply seemingly arbitrary tariff rates on dozens of countries. White House officials are insisting the rollbacks do not amount to a retreat from the president's staunch defense of tariffs as an economic driver. “This is nothing new,"" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday in response to a question of whether the reversals represent an acknowledgement that the policies have contributed to rising costs. Hassett cited previous moves by the administration to exempt certain products from duties following trade-framework agreements. One day earlier, Hassett told ABC News' “This Week” that price increases for some goods weren't being solely caused by tariffs — but acknowledged that prices could start coming down as imports into the U.S. climb. He also sought to blame former President Joe Biden, whose administration oversaw a post-pandemic inflation surge. “We understand that people still feel the pain of the high prices, but we’re closing the gap fast,” Hassett said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent likewise sought to cast blame for rising beef prices backward. ""The beef market is a very specialized market,” Bessent began. “It goes in long cycles. And this is the perfect storm, again, something we inherited.” In addition to Friday's broad rollback of food-related tariffs, Trump also announced Friday that he was significantly reducing tariffs on goods from Switzerland, which had faced some of the highest duties yet announced during Trump’s second term. A day earlier, the White House said many food products from four Central and South American countries would be exempted from levies after they agreed to trade frameworks with the U.S. The U.S. economy continues to contend with stubborn inflation — especially for many everyday grocery items. Orange juice prices have increased approximately 29% year on year, while beef costs are up 13.5%, according to the latest NBC News grocery price tracker data. While some of the factors influencing the cost increases are not directly tied to tariffs, economists have estimated that consumers have been shouldering more than 50% of the overall price increases seen from Trump's import duties. Businesses and analysts alike continue to sound the alarm on the impact of tariffs, saying they are compounding the stubborn inflation that has taken root since the pandemic and holding back investment decisions. The U.S. manufacturing sector — consisting of industries the administration had hoped would benefit most directly from the trade duties — has been particularly hard-hit, with many indicators suggesting it is in recession. Between February and August, manufacturing employment fell by some 41,000 jobs. Small businesses, whose owners tend to lean more conservative, have also seen an outsize impact from tariffs. Key elements of Trump’s tariff regime now also face legal jeopardy, however, as the Supreme Court weighs whether Trump illegally bypassed Congress when he imposed reciprocal duties and fentanyl-related tariffs using emergency powers authorization. Oral arguments before the court earlier this month indicated that multiple justices believed there were constitutional limits built into the emergency tariff powers the administration has claimed during Trump’s second term. A decision is expected before the end of the year. In a statement Monday, a White House spokesman said the administration remains “committed to the tariff policies that have secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America along with unprecedented trade deals for American workers, industries, and farmers.” “President Trump’s September 5th executive order specifically laid out various natural resources and agricultural products not produced in the United States that could be eligible for tariff-free treatment in the context of trade deals — the President’s recent tariff announcement reflects how the Administration has now secured a critical mass of trade deals with countries in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, and Asia,” spokesman Kush Desai said. But whether all the products that were most recently exempted from tariffs fall into the category of “not produced in the United States” is doubtful. Beef and oranges are produced in the United States, for example, and yet they were included on Friday’s list of broad exemptions from all reciprocal tariffs — not just from duties on imports from countries where the U.S. has secured trade deals. In the Friday executive order that rolled back all reciprocal tariffs on certain food products, Trump cited “current domestic demand for certain products, and current domestic capacity to produce certain products.” That definition goes beyond the strict categories of products the United States does not produce and products from countries with which the U.S. has trade agreements. It signals that a desire to cool off price increases is increasingly being seen as a justification for tariff exemptions on some products, like beef. Last week’s announcements are not the first time Trump has signaled a willingness to reconsider his trade stances. Throughout the spring and summer, the president frequently floated higher duties on a trade partner, usually amid ongoing negotiations, only to backtrack on them later. Some on Wall Street eventually dubbed the inevitable reversals “TACO” — “Trump Always Chickens Out.” The back-and-forth announcements served to whipsaw markets, with the president often standing down after major stock indexes experienced declines in response to his threats. It is unlikely tariffs are going away entirely: The White House has signaled it would likely seek to reimpose some duties via other statutes if the Supreme Court rules against Trump’s emergency authority. Just last month, the president announced a slew of new duties on imports including furniture, heavy trucks and pharmaceuticals. The tariffs have also raised billions in revenues — though even with those increased funds, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has said U.S. lawmakers will “need to identify substantially more deficit reduction to put debt on a sustainable path.” Any ruling that calls for refunds of the collected funds could have unforeseen consequences on the economy. Still, some analysts say the recent tariff rollbacks may have only just begun. “What matters more for the outlook … is the signal that this move sends about the directional shift of future tariff adjustments,” Bernard Yaros, economist with Oxford Economics research group, wrote in a note published Saturday. “As we near the (2026 midterm) election, the administration may broaden these tariff exemptions to a wider swathe of food products.”",left
"Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill won the New Jersey governor’s race, NBC News projects, defeating Republican Jack Ciattarelli after a hard-fought contest in which President Donald Trump loomed over voters’ choice. Sherrill worked to make the race a referendum on the president, casting Ciattarelli as a Trump acolyte who will not stand up to the president. Follow election live updates here “He’ll do whatever Trump tells him to do, and I will fight anybody to work for you,” Sherrill said in their first debate in October. Trump made gains across the country in 2024, but his second-biggest gain in any state came in New Jersey. The president lost the state by 6 points last year, a 10-point improvement over his margin in the 2020 election. Now, Sherrill's victory sends a signal that Republicans can't expect those improved results from Trump to represent a straight line forward into future elections. Instead, the party is facing headwinds, as voters react to the president's handling of the economy and other issues. Following Trump's closer-than-expected finish in 2024, the New Jersey governor’s race drew more than $100 million in ad spending from both parties, according to AdImpact. The contest presented an early test, ahead of next year’s midterm elections, of how to appeal to swingy Latino voters and navigate rising costs, especially for electricity. Democrats also looked to energize their party’s core supporters, particularly Black voters, while Republicans confronted the persistent challenge of turning out Trump’s supporters when he is not on the ballot. A majority of New Jersey voters (54%) disapproved of Trump’s job as president and nearly two-thirds were dissatisfied or angry about the direction of the country, according to the NBC News exit poll. Trump was also a factor for a slim majority of New Jersey voters, with Sherrill winning virtually all of the 38% of voters who said their vote was to oppose Trump, while Ciattarelli won the 13% of voters who said their vote was to support Trump. Both Sherrill and Ciattarelli focused much of their campaign on the state’s high cost of living, and voters said taxes, the economy and health care were among the most important issues facing the state. While Ciattarelli won over voters who said taxes were the most important issue, Sherrill won over voters who said the economy and health care were most important. Sherrill, 53, sharply criticized Trump on the campaign trail, often saying that Trump administration’s policies were “raising costs on everything from a cup of coffee to your groceries,” pledging to join a lawsuit against Trump’s tariff policies on her first day in office. Ciattarelli, 63, largely praised Trump, who endorsed Ciattarelli in the GOP primary, but he also argued that the president did not have control over the state’s high cost of living and high taxes. Ciattarelli, meanwhile, sought to make the race a referendum on Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy — who could not run for re-election due to term limits — and the Democrats who control state government. Ciattarelli lost a surprisingly close 3-point race to Murphy in 2021. “New Jersey, we need change,” Ciattarelli said during his first debate against Sherrill, suggesting the state was facing four major crises in affordability, public education, public safety and overdevelopment. But it was not enough for Ciattarelli to pull off a win. While a slim majority of voters (51%) disapproved of Murphy’s job as governor, Sherrill won over 19% of them. And 45% approved of Murphy. Sherrill also won over voters Ciattarelli was hoping to put in his column, including independents. She handily won Latino voters, despite Trump's gains in heavily Latino parts of the state last year. New Jersey also continued its historic trend of the party that controls the White House has losing eight of the state’s previous 10 gubernatorial races. Sherrill, meanwhile, bucked a different historic trend, helping her party win three consecutive gubernatorial elections for the first time since 1961. Sherrill’s climb to the governorship during Trump’s second term comes after she was first elected to Congress in the 2018 blue wave that followed Trump’s first presidential victory. In that race, when she flipped a longtime Republican House seat, Sherrill stressed her background as a Navy pilot, a former prosecutor and a mom of four kids, as she did in her campaign for governor. She won a hotly contested primary for the Democratic nomination this year, and many of Sherrill’s supporters backed her because they viewed her as most likely to win and most likely to take on Trump. Sherrill’s main focus on the campaign trail was on the state’s high cost of living. She pledged to declare a state of emergency on utility costs on her first day in office, freezing electricity rates and then working to bring down the costs. The four-term congresswoman also pledged to fight the Trump administration over federal funding for the Gateway Tunnel Project, a massive project to add rail tunnels between New York and New Jersey. Trump recently said he canceled funding for the project amid the federal government shutdown. Sherrill was also boosted in the race by Democratic allies, with outside groups spending more than $40 million on ads casting Ciattarelli as beholden to Trump and targeting Ciattarelli’s record in the state Legislature. Big-name Democratic surrogates, including some potential 2028 presidential contenders, also hit the campaign trail to support Sherrill, with former President Barack Obama rallying supporters over the weekend.",left

"Americans could soon see some goods get cheaper after President Donald Trump exempted certain agricultural imports from a set of tariffs on Friday. But any price drops likely won’t be enough to make life feel more affordable any time soon. The executive order exempted products like coffee, beef and some fruit from Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, which began rolling out in April. The new exemptions are part of what traders have dubbed TACO, or Trump Always Chickens Out, to describe times when the president backs off a policy after unintended consequences pop up. In the case of tariffs, Trump has already reversed a number of his measures, a sign that the administration is reshaping his signature economic tool. The latest TACO comes after voters, worried about affordability, gave Republicans a drubbing in recent off-year elections. Nevertheless, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the new exemptions generally won’t help improve affordability. “It depends on what the importers do with the tariff,” he said in a CNBC interview on Friday. “So when you look at the overall price trend, it hasn’t been because of tariffs. It’s been because of these other events going on and just supply and demand.” But in cases where tariffs have been passed along to consumers, prices could drop, Greer said. One potential example: bananas. American consumers are paying about 8% more for bananas than before Trump’s second term began. The US largely imports bananas from South American countries. With bananas exempt from “reciprocal” tariffs that started at 10%, prices could go back to where they were earlier this year, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. But it’s unlikely to be something most consumers notice unless they’re buying bananas often, she added. But not everyone is convinced it will even do that much. “It is not clear that lowering tariffs will lower prices — it depends on what retailers think they can get away with. The import price of bananas has fallen since tariffs were imposed, but the US consumer price has risen,” Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS global wealth management, said in a note last week. (The United States tracks import prices before accounting for tariffs. In some cases, import prices have fallen as exporters lower what they charge as a way to share in the tariff expense importers pay.) Make America more affordable? The White House has ramped up its efforts to convince voters that affordability issues are just a hangover from former President Joe Biden. “Putting Joe Biden’s inflation crisis firmly behind us has been a priority for President Trump since Day One, when he signed an array of executive orders to slash costly regulations and unleash American energy,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNN in a statement. But economists generally agree that Trump’s tariffs aren’t making matters better. And while prices normally fluctuate, especially for food, they generally get more expensive over time, House said. “That’s why this isn’t going to, I think, cure consumers’ angst about elevated prices,” she said.",left
"Last month, Eli Lilly’s weight-loss drug Mounjaro became India’s top-selling drug, overtaking GSK’s widely used antibiotic Augmentin. Mounjaro was only launched in India in March, a testimony to the explosive demand for these medications. Last month it outsold rival weight-loss drug Wegovy (produced by Novo Nordisk) by a ratio of 10 to one. [ Eli Lilly’s blockbuster weight-loss drugs drive surge in Irish exportsOpens in new window ] India – with a population of more than 1.4 billion – has become a key battleground in the global weight-loss market. Analysts predict the market could generate €130 billion a year by the end of the decade. READ MORE This little snippet of news and its importance for Ireland went largely unnoticed here. Eli Lilly manufactures the ingredients for Mounjaro and its diabetes drug Zepbound in Kinsale, Co Cork. The unprecedented surge in Irish exports this year (exports to the US rose by 153 per cent to €71 billion between January and May) was almost entirely driven by shipments of these ingredients. Using US customs data, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) tracked approximately $42.3 billion (€36.4 billion) of this export surge to Indianapolis, where Eli Lilly is headquartered and where it has several big manufacturing sites. “This spike in exports likely reflects strong US demand for these medicines, along with stockpiling in the US ahead of potential tariff changes,” the council said. The jump in exports is expected to see the economy here expand by almost 11 per cent in gross domestic product (GDP) terms this year, which is almost certain to make it the fastest-growing advanced economy in the world in 2025. Despite all the talk of trade barriers and protectionism, we still reside in a globalised trading world, populated by multinational corporations that wield immense power; the power to propel an entire economy to the top of the growth charts. Ifac’s report highlights the conflicting forces swirling around Ireland’s pharma industry. On one level, it is in the crosshairs of Donald Trump’s America First agenda. That’s not just because it has exploited anomalies in the US tax law to offshore production (with Ireland a significant beneficiary). It also charges US consumers significantly more for basic medicines, something Trump has pledged to tackle. Conversely, it is sitting on a potential boom in weight-loss therapies. Eli Lilly reported stellar third-quarter earnings last month while raising its projected full-year revenue to $63 billion (€54.2 billion) on the back of soaring Mounjaro and Zepound sales. The company also announced a direct-to-consumer partnership with Walmart, offering customers single-dose vials of Zepbound for under $500 (€430) in its pharmacies. So far, pharma has escaped US tariffs and Washington has struck deals with industry heavyweights Pfizer and AstraZeneca. This suggests that behind the scenes, the White House is more pragmatic than Trump’s threats. But as economist (and Irish Times columnist) John FitzGerald said in a recent report, “there remains the threat of further US policy action to either cut US pharmaceutical prices or to force firms to source a greater share of their sales in the US from production in the US”. Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Roche have each committed to investing $50 billion in the US while Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, AbbVie, Gilead, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sanofi and Eli Lilly have all committed to investing between $10 billion and $40 billion. China is also rivalling US dominance in the sector. “China is not simply making generics anymore,” Ifac notes. “It is now developing high-quality biopharmaceuticals more quickly and cheaply than its western counterparts. China has a much smaller pharma footprint in Ireland, relative to the US.” How all this will play out in an already volatile sector is impossible to say. Back in 2011, the industry was at a similar crossroads. Twenty blockbuster drugs, including Pfizer’s cholesterol-lowering medication Lipitor and Bristol-Myers Squibb/Sanofi’s blood thinner Plavix, were set to go off patent. They represented over a quarter of global annual sales. There was serious concern that this so-called patent cliff would damage the Irish economy at a time when it was mired in financial chaos after the 2008 crash. Predictions that we would see a mass exodus of firms, however, proved ill-founded. Instead, the sector moved more high-end, manufacturing large-molecule drugs or biologics. Twenty-four of the top 25 pharmaceutical companies in the world now have operations here. Many of these firms manufacture active ingredients for branded medicines, the most profitable stage of drug manufacturing. Eli Lilly could, in theory, make the ingredients for its weight-loss drugs in the US rather than in Ireland, but moving production would involve a huge commitment of resources and could take years. It would also involve paying the US’s headline 21 per cent tax rate on profits rather than Ireland’s 12.5 per cent (bumped up to 15 per cent for big multinationals) – something Wall Street shareholders might not be too happy about. Either way, Ireland’s winning streak on foreign direct investment (FDI) comes with a concentration risk, not just in terms of tax receipts but also in actual exports, as the Eli Lilly example illustrates. As these firms get bigger and more profitable, Ireland’s concentration risk grows.",left
"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has robustly defended the extent of his foreign travel during 2025, arguing that international engagement is vital and that going back to an “isolationist position” where Ireland does not attend any meeting is “ridiculous”. Mr Martin has been abroad 20 times since becoming Taoiseach early this year. UK prime minister Keir Starmer has come under fire in Britain for spending too long abroad and not focusing enough on domestic issues. Mr Starmer has travelled abroad on fewer occasions than the Taoiseach this year. The Taoiseach questioned the premise of such a position and said it was not an objective one. “Most people in the country accept that the leader of the country has to engage internationally,” he said. READ MORE “So much emanates from the international world in terms of influence. The first crisis we had to deal with was the tariffs issue. It is important for jobs in our economy, for the technology industry, for the life sciences industry. We navigated that well both within the European Union and indeed with the United States. That’s why international engagement matters, for God’s sake. “Do people think we go back to a sort of an isolated position where we don’t attend any meetings? This is ridiculous.” Mr Martin was speaking in Luanda, the capital of Angola, in advance of a meeting between European leaders and their counterparts from Africa. He has travelled to Angola from South Africa where he attended the G20 summit over the course of the weekend. The Taoiseach insisted he limited his visits to functional meetings and ones that were in Ireland’s interests. “I don’t go abroad for any other reason than to advance the country’s agenda, and in particular with the tariff situation. So I went to Japan because Japan invests hugely in Ireland … “The counter move against tariffs is to double down on trade deals with other important economic entities, and we have to engage as a country doing that. [ First G20 on African soil undermined by Trump administrationOpens in new window ] “If people want to withdraw in sort of cheap commentary on soundbites and go the isolationist role and not engage with people, the country will be poor.” Mr Martin said he was not aware of any people within his party criticising him for travelling abroad. “Are people saying we shouldn’t attend Cop?” he asked. “There’s a need for a bit of common sense, a sense of perspective,” he added, arguing that those who were criticising it were making a mountain out of a molehill. The Department of the Taoiseach confirmed Mr Martin has taken six trips on EU business and a further six in relation to EU engagement this year. There have been two bilateral meetings with the UK; a United Nations meeting in New York (followed by a bilateral visit to Canada); the Cop summit in Brazil; the St Patrick’s Day trip to the United States; and the attendance at the G20 in South Africa followed by the EU-African Union summit in Angola. The Taoiseach also went on a bilateral visit to Japan during the summer.",left
"It’s the Trump ship that never sails. The president was back at it on Monday, promising an imminent solution to America’s growing health care crisis — on which he has repeatedly failed to deliver in the past. “I tell you, we’re going to be working on that very hard over the next short period of time, where the people get the money,” President Donald Trump said, referring specifically to Americans thrown into crisis by expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. “We’re talking about trillions and trillions of dollars, where the people get the money,” he added, without giving details about a vague idea to send cash to affected policyholders to replace subsidies while bypassing insurance firms. Trump’s off-the-cuff answer was a typical example of the waffle he sometimes conjures to escape a jam in a photo-op. But he could not disguise the downside of his “win” in the government shutdown, which looks set to end after Democrats failed to secure their top demand: the extension of those enhanced Obamacare subsidies. Trump and Republicans once again own the issue of health care, with millions of citizens — not just those on ACA plans — afflicted by rising premiums and high deductibles against the backdrop of a wider cost-of-living crisis. And just as in his first term, Trump lacks a comprehensive, detailed plan to bring relief to citizens who lack health care, who can’t afford the plans they have or who know that the loss of a job could leave them without any coverage at all. If the GOP cannot fix the immediate issue of the subsidies — and convince voters they have a serious solution to this and other affordability questions — their 2026 midterm election hopes could take a dive. Trump’s fogginess on health care is nothing new. Repeated unfulfilled promises to act took their place alongside his much-lampooned “infrastructure weeks” as punch lines in his first term. Trump’s pledges to replace Obamacare shimmered with hyperbole but delivered nothing, and the 2010 law survives despite multiple Republican efforts to destroy it. During the 2016 campaign, Trump pledged to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something “terrific.” At rallies, he promised Americans new health care that would cost less but be far better. If that sounds impossible, it’s probably because it is. Early in his first term, Trump promised that change was on the way. “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!” he wrote on the website formerly known as Twitter in March 2017. The GOP failure to repeal Obamacare, partly because it couldn’t come up with an alternative, didn’t stop Trump’s sunny predictions. “The Republican Party will be soon be known as theparty of health care,” the president declared in March 2019. Second term, same as the first. In his debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in 2024, Trump was mocked for saying he had “concepts of a plan” to make health care “better and less expensive.” More than a year later — and despite some significant efforts by Trump to bring down the cost of some prescription drugs — Americans are still waiting for his wider solutions. Republican divisions boil over health care The fight over health care was not just at the center of the government shutdown battle with Democrats. It’s tearing at Republican Party unity. It’s even estranged Trump and one of his most outspoken supporters, Marjorie Taylor Greene. The Georgia representative broke ranks early in the shutdown to highlight ACA insurance premiums for her family that she said would double in price due to expiring subsidies. While no fan of the ACA, she lashed out at her own party. “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” Greene wrote on X in October. Greene’s persistent criticism is a warning sign for House Speaker Mike Johnson after he called back the House to vote on the Senate plan to reopen the government this week. It might explain why he was so keen to keep the chamber dark during a shutdown that set internal GOP dissent simmering. Greene further distanced herself from Trump on Monday, saying on X that he should spend less time meeting foreign leaders and instead hold “nonstop” meetings on domestic policy. The president told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “I don’t know what happened to Marjorie. She’s a nice woman, but I don’t know what happened. She’s lost her way, I think.” Greene then told CNN, “I haven’t lost my way. I’m 100% America first and only!” Greene might now be regarded as a MAGA heretic by some in Trump’s orbit. But her comments on health care raise another possibility — that she’s far more in tune with the economic insecurity felt by regular Americans than a billionaire president and his wealthy Cabinet. She’s not alone. During the shutdown, a group of endangered House Republicans wrote to Johnson to urge him to address expiring enhanced ACA subsidies when the government reopens. “While we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it,” they wrote. Senate Republican leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote in December on extending enhanced Obamacare subsidies as part of the deal with moderate Democrats to reopen the government. Chances of a Democrat-written bill passing are slim. But the vote will put GOP senators on the record and on a political spot. Johnson hasn’t pledged to hold a similar vote — one reason why progressive Democrats are angry about centrist Senate Democrats’ compromise to end the shutdown. The speaker told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” Monday that he’d always been willing to talk about rising health care costs, but that Democrats had squandered weeks of valuable time by triggering the shutdown last month. He promised debate on a plan to get to the “root cause” of the health care issue. But that is unlikely to help ACA policyholders forced to decide now whether to give up health plans they can’t afford or pay punitively rising premiums. Johnson could not tell Tapper whether there’d be a vote on this issue soon. “I’m not committing to it or not committing to it. What I’m saying is that we do a deliberative process. It’s the way this always works and we have to have time to do that,” the speaker said. But the tiny GOP majority gives little cause for optimism that an issue as complex and divisive as health care reform is something the fractious GOP and an absent president could handle. One tangible gain for Democrats in the shutdown drama was their highlighting of the ACA issue and attacks on Republicans for failing to fix health care. In an NBC News poll taken last month during the shutdown, 10% of respondents cited the cost of health care premiums as the single top issue deciding their vote for Congress next year. And 49% of respondents said Democrats would do a better job dealing with health care compared with 26% who thought the same of Republicans Many Democrats are furious that their moderate Senate colleagues made a deal with Republicans to reopen the government because they see it as a betrayal of Americans on the health care issue. But Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who helped broker the deal and joined seven others in the Democratic caucus to back it, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan the deal would show whether Republicans were serious. “Finally, because of the shutdown fight, we’ve had a number of Republicans who have figured out that this is an issue for them,” the New Hampshire Democrat said. “So, now we’ll see. We’ll see if they are really going to work with us to make sure that Americans can afford their health insurance.” Viewing Democratic tactics, a cynic might wonder whether the party, which failed to make the enhanced Obamacare credits permanent during the Biden administration, laid a trap for Republicans on an issue their rivals always failed to solve, especially under Trump. But some Republicans don’t buy the idea that the party is vulnerable on health care, arguing that Democrats would be blamed for higher costs. GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt told CNN that “I think people know that Democrats own Obamacare, and it’s been a disaster.” How Trump has tried to lower some health care costs Republicans argue that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” domestic policy law had already made significant steps to make health care more affordable by loosening the power of insurance companies and by restoring choice and control, partly by handing more responsibility to the states. But multiple health care analysts and groups say that the bill’s cuts to Medicaid funding could leave millions vulnerable to losing coverage and threaten many rural hospitals with closure. The administration has several initiatives designed to reduce the costs of prescription drugs for Americans. It plans to launch TrumpRx, a direct-to-consumer website, early next year. Last week, the president unveiled a plan to make certain obesity drugs available for as little as $149 in an arrangement that gives pharmaceutical firms like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk tariff breaks. If this plan works, it could be lifesaving for many patients who can’t get the drugs through their insurers and can’t afford out-of-pocket prices to buy them. The initiative reflects Trump’s willingness to use government power to intervene in markets, which has also been seen in other sectors, and which flies in the face of conservative orthodoxy. A plan he recently floated to send money directly to ACA policyholders, instead of offering subsidies, also seems to spring from a similar motivation to shake up the industry. Yet the idea is fraught with uncertainties, including whether such payments would cover the shortfall of all the subsidies. Another question is whether it would simply make up the shortfall in subsidies to pay for premiums. Or would it be a separate payment that patients could use to pay for the costs of treatment directly? In the latter case of a payment that bypasses insurance firms, recipients might be exposed to massive costs if they get an adverse diagnosis. Trump told Fox News on Monday evening that he didn’t want money to go to insurance companies but that it would go into a separate account so people could negotiate their own, better health insurance. “They’re going to feel like entrepreneurs,” Trump said. But he gave no details of how such a complex scheme could help policyholders now, and did not explain how it would lower costs. And spiking health costs don’t only afflict ACA policyholders. If the government sent cash to certain Americans, how would that be fair to other taxpayers? And wouldn’t state-financed payments for health care go against everything the GOP believes? Such thorny questions, and the president’s past failures to deliver on health care, explain the Republican Party’s new but familiar political nightmare on an issue that causes anxiety for tens of millions of voters.

"Weddings can be expensive and stressful. But this year, prospective brides and grooms are dealing with an added layer, and it’s not cake. It’s tariffs. Two million weddings take place in the United States every year, but they are very much an international affair. From the engagement ring to the cake, chairs, florals and the dress, all these items are touched by tariffs. Even those carefully crafted in the United States can contain multiple components from around the world. President Donald Trump’s trade agenda isn’t helping the average cost of a US wedding, which had already risen by 18% to $33,000 over the last five years, according to The Knot, a global wedding planning and vendor marketplace. With tariff rates as high as 50% for some countries, you can expect costs to rise. Vendors are “forced to make tough calls about whether to absorb increased costs or adjust their pricing, all while maintaining the level of service and quality their clients expect,” said Raina Moskowitz, CEO of The Knot Worldwide. One in five vendors have increased costs because of tariffs, according to the Knot, and 33% of engaged couples say they’re worried about price increases. The Dress Beyond the bride, the dress is the star of the show. Wedding dresses cost about $2,100, according to the Knot, which are often ordered and paid for more than a year in advance. That means that by the time the dress arrives (often shipped from overseas), tariff rates can change. “That dress that we agreed to a price with the shop on is all of a sudden costing us 30%, 40% more,” said Justin Alexander, president of the 79-year-old brand Justin Alexander Wedding Dresses. The family-owned dressmaker sells 70,000 dresses each year, with 40,000 sold to US brides. The company manufactures in Myanmar (40% tariff), China (20%), Vietnam (20%), and Portugal (10%). “We’ve been diversifying our production out of China, but recent developments with higher tariffs in countries like Myanmar have been confusing and challenging,” said Alexander. But the added cost doesn’t just depend on where the dress is manufactured. Many of the materials in a single garment, like the lace, lining and tulle, could be sourced from multiple other countries, all with their own tariff rates. Alexander said it would difficult to shift dress and material production back to the United States because of higher labor costs and the lack of manufacturing at scale. It would also end up raising costs for brides by eleven to fifteen times in terms of price. Brides in the market for a Justin Alexander gown can already expect to pay 10% more. “The price has been increased because we have a tariff surcharge to account for the increase in tariffs varying from 20% to 40%,” said Alexander, who said the company absorbs the rest. The Cake Wedding cake orders are often placed later in the wedding planning process, sometimes just three weeks before the event, and can cost $540 on average, according to the Knot. Armana Christianson is the owner and cake artist at A. Cakes Bakery in Phoenix, Arizona. She bakes 100 high-end cakes each year that can cost anywhere from $800 to $1000. Christianson said one cake can have up to a dozen ingredients – all sourced from different countries with varying tariff rates. So she’s introduced a new contract to make sure she’s protected from fluctuating prices. “If my pricing raises more than 5%… then I’m able to tell my clients and potentially charge them for that increase if it’s something just exorbitant,” said Christianson. She said it’s dizzying to keep track of all the tariff rates, which for her ingredients can range up to 20%. “I’m raising and readjusting (my prices) every six months,” said Christianson. “My percentage booked from inquiries just goes down a little bit more each time, which is why I would prefer to not have to change my pricing. So often it is scary as a small business owner, this is my living.” Diamonds and precious gemstones Before ‘I do,’ comes ‘yes!’ The engagement ring signals the official start of wedding planning. Engagement rings currently cost about $5,200 on average, according to the Knot. Jewelers said couples are getting increasingly creative with their rings, opting for precious gemstones and lab-grown diamonds, but many still look for traditional diamonds. Many of the stones and rings that couples see in stores have likely been in the United States for at least six months. That means the current stock is mostly tariff-free, but that inventory is running thin. “Everything new coming in is going to incur (a) tariff. Consumers that are buying in January of 2026 are going to see a lot higher prices than people that are buying today,” said Ankur Daga, co-founder of Angara Jewelry, a Los Angeles-based company. A solitaire diamond ring at Angara, for example, is sourced from Botswana and carries a 15% tariff. The gold could be from Indonesia or Chile, which carries tariffs of 19% and 10%, respectively, or the US or Canada, which may not carry any duties at all. Angara sources its sapphires from Sri Lanka (20% tariff), rubies from Mozambique (15% tariff), emeralds from Zambia (15%) and Colombia (10%), and opals from Australia (10%). But the majority of all diamonds – 90% – are cut and polished in India, which holds a towering tariff rate of 50%. That’s why Angara now does all final manufacturing for its US market out of Thailand, not India, so stones coming to the United States carry a lower 19% tariff rate. Yet Daga believes there is still a market for affordability. “What tariffs will do is drive the adoption of lab-grown (diamonds) far faster. It’s already at 57%, for engagement rings. We think within five years, this will be 80%,” he said. The Flowers Floral prices can be one of the most volatile in any wedding. Eighty percent of all cut flowers are imported to the US, and a flower market may sell roses at different prices from each day to the next. Add in changing tariff rates, and it gets complicated for vendors. “That’s been kind of the worst part, just nailing down the consistency of it and nailing down what to expect and how to protect myself and my business,” said Marie Lewis, the owner of Nocturne in Bloom, a floral design studio in Los Angeles. Couples spend $2,700 on average for florals, according to the Knot. One bouquet or arrangement likely has several types of flowers, each sourced from different countries. Even the vases and candle holders have gone up in price. Lewis buys hers from China. “What I’ve been doing is just trying to pad the pricing a little bit more within each floral arrangement,” she said. “That makes sure that I’m charging for my services and materials appropriately so that I’m not left in the hole, but also making sure that I am being appropriate with my clients.” Venue and event design After all the planning and anticipation, the big day is here. The venue which hosts the event can cost couples an average of $12,000, according to the Knot. Rentals cost an additional $2,000. It’s currently the busy season for the Treasury Venue Collection in St. Augustine, Florida, which runs from October through May. The company hosts up to 300 weddings a year at its two locations. The Treasury Venue Collection hasn’t had to raise prices this year, partly because it identified where the tariffs would impact costs most. This summer, the venue stockpiled popular imported liquor, wine and champagne. “Alcohol, that is our vulnerable item,” said Brandy Boulette, the general manager at the Treasury Venue Collection. “We didn’t necessarily have to worry about our venue cost changing, because it’s kind of a fixed thing, but our bar service was going to be something that was definitely impacted.” A venue typically provides linens, chairs, glassware, and cutlery, which are purchased in bulk and reused wedding-to-wedding. But those items often have to be replaced because of wear and tear. “We’re telling people right now with anything they might have been budgeting for – put a buffer in there,” said Boulette. Some venues are just a raw space, and it’s up to the couple to bring everything else in. They often rely on event design companies like Paisley & Jade in Richmond, Virginia, that specialize in luxury rentals and custom designs, to help. “Even building a simple shelf for a back bar really involves all of these bits and pieces from all over,” said Morgan Montgomery, co-owner of Paisley & Jade. A custom venue design may have pendant lights and chairs from China, or a custom cake table of materials from New Zealand, Malaysia, and Canada. And special-order items that aren’t already in inventory come at a premium. “I won’t guarantee a price. I can give you a ballpark, but I will not lock it in because my business cannot be on the hook for telling you that I can get you this sofa for $1,200 a piece, only to find out that the tariffs jumped by the time I placed the order,” said Montgomery.",left

"When Fox News host Laura Ingraham reminded President Donald Trump in an interview this week that coffee prices are high, Trump responded, “Coffee: We’re going to lower some tariffs, we’re going to have some coffee come in. We’re gonna take care of all this stuff very quickly, very easily.” The “very quickly, very easily” bluster aside, that would be a rather unremarkable response from someone else. It’s obvious that Trump’s global tariffs on imported goods like coffee — a product that is almost entirely imported in the US — have contributed to the big coffee price increases experienced by Americans this year. Consumer Price Index figures for September show coffee was about 15% more expensive on average than it was in January, the month Trump returned to office. But Trump doesn’t usually acknowledge such truths. He has wrongly insisted for years that tariff costs are covered entirely by foreign countries, or split between foreign countries and US corporations, and do not raise the prices paid by American consumers. He’s been fact-checked over and over. This time, in suggesting that cutting tariffs will cut prices, he was essentially fact-checking himself. “Evidence that Trump et al. understand tariffs are taxes that increase prices for consumers, they just usually lie about it,” Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation think tank, posted on X in response to Trump’s comment on Fox. She added in an email: “The President has often claimed that foreigners pay the tariffs and has generally dismissed concerns about the tariffs negatively affecting Americans. By saying he will lift coffee tariffs to provide relief, he is acknowledging the burden that tariffs create on American consumers.” Trump has usually denied tariff reality The US government’s tariffs on imported products are paid to the government by importers in the US, adding to the importers’ expenses. Study after study, and numerous statements from US businesses of all sizes, have confirmed that many importers pass on some or all of these added costs to final consumers. Trump has repeatedly denied this reality — insisting, against all the evidence, that consumers aren’t negatively affected by tariffs whatsoever. Compare his comment on Fox to what he said on the campaign trail in 2024: “We’re going to be a tariff nation. It’s not going to be a cost to you, it’s going to be a cost to another country.” Or look at what he said at the White House in May: “Tariffs are the most misunderstood thing maybe in any form of business anywhere in business. Oftentimes the country picks them up, oftentimes the company picks it up; the people don’t pick it up, OK? The people don’t pick it up.” Bananas, another product almost entirely imported in the US, had an average price increase of about 8% between January and September, Consumer Price Index figures show. Trump had dismissed widespread warnings earlier this year that coffee and banana prices would rise when he declined to exempt those products from his tariff regime, even though the US can’t grow them domestically on a large scale. Tariffs affecting coffee prices include a 50% tariff on products from Brazil, the biggest supplier of Americans’ coffee. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed in a Fox News interview on Wednesday that the administration believes prices will fall after it makes “substantial announcements over the next couple of days” on coffee, bananas and other produce “we don’t grow here in the United States.” “That will bring the prices down very quickly,” Bessent said. Time will tell. Companies that raised prices on these products in part because of the tariffs may be reluctant to quickly reduce them even after potential tariff cuts, especially with various global factors having elevated coffee crop prices this year and overall US inflation having increased for five consecutive months.",left
"Shoppers are still flocking to Walmart. The company raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook Thursday, heading into the crucial holiday shopping season. Walmart also offered fresh signs that it is shedding its original identity as a strictly down-market brick-and-mortar operation by growing its e-commerce business and increasing its market share of higher-income shoppers. Walmart's shares closed more than 6% higher Thursday, even as the broader market suffered a dramatic sell-off. The stock is up more than 18% this year. The biggest retailer and grocer in the United States acknowledged the added financial pressures on lower-income households but said middle-income families are holding up. Walmart saw more sales growth in its grocery and health and wellness product categories than in general merchandise. ""As pocketbooks have been stretched, you're seeing more consumer dollars go to necessities versus discretionary items,"" Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said on a call with analysts Thursday morning. The company reported that same-store sales for Walmart U.S. rose 4.5% in the quarter that ended Oct. 31, exceeding analysts’ expectations. “The team delivered another strong quarter across the business. eCommerce was a bright spot again this quarter. We’re gaining market share, improving delivery speed, and managing inventory well,” outgoing CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. Walmart reported 27% growth in e-commerce sales globally. Walmart also announced that it will move from trading on the New York Stock Exchange to the tech-heavy Nasdaq next month. It’s the latest sign of America's largest private employer working to position itself as tech-forward in order to compete with Amazon. The discounter's third-quarter earnings come amid growing questions about whether Americans contending with tariffs, corporate layoffs and accelerating inflation are still confidently spending on retail. As a bellwether for the U.S. economy and consumer confidence, Walmart’s strong earnings and guidance indicate that consumers are still shopping — at least at the lower end of the retail price point. The company announced last week that McMillon will step down in January. McMillon, 59, started at Walmart as an associate in the 1980s and has helmed the company since 2014. Under his leadership, Walmart improved pay and benefits for many employees, renovated hundreds of stores and boosted its e-commerce and delivery programs, especially during the Covid pandemic. John Furner, CEO of Walmart U.S., will take over the top job Feb. 1. Since 2019, Furner has led Walmart's American operations — by far the largest slice of the company, with around 1.6 million of Walmart's approximately 2.1 million total associates worldwide. Walmart is leading the retail race against longtime rival Target, which Wednesday reported a drop in third-quarter sales and cut its full-year profit guidance. Target’s sales have faltered over the last few years, with some consumers expressing frustration over what they said were disorganized stores and rollbacks of the company's diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In October, Target said it would cut about 1,800 corporate jobs. Target is hoping for a fresh start in the new year. Incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke will take over Feb. 1, the same day Furner becomes CEO of Walmart. The struggling retailer said Wednesday that it plans to increase its investment in stores and technology next year by 25%. Since January, U.S. businesses have had to contend with ever-changing tariffs under the Trump administration. Walmart has navigated the uncertainty by raising prices on some items, while swallowing some tariff costs on others. In the three months that ended Oct. 31, prices at Walmart U.S. rose around 1% overall, with higher prices on electronics, toys and seasonal items in particular due to tariff pressures. In the grocery section, Walmart expects egg prices to drop but anticipates the record-breaking beef prices will stay high, in part from cattle herds shrinking over the last few decades. Prices for other grocery staples are also up, though the Trump administration's rollback of tariffs on many food items last week could offer some relief. Despite the rising prices, Walmart is offering its annual Thanksgiving menu deal for 10 at less than $4 per person. It's less expensive than last year's package, but it also contains fewer items. The company is also expanding its use of artificial intelligence, teaming up with OpenAI to allow customers to buy from Walmart within ChatGPT. Walmart has not detailed the terms of the partnership or shared when the new option could be available. This week, Target announced its own collaboration with OpenAI. Walmart has lagged behind rival Amazon in AI-driven e-commerce — Amazon debuted its Rufus shopping assistant in February 2024, more than a year before Walmart launched its counterpart, Sparky.",left
"The longest government shutdown in history is over. Jeffrey Epstein wrote about Trump, Clinton and Andrew in newly released emails. And, the president's political foes facing federal charges seek to oust their prosecutor. Here's what to know today. Trump signs bill to end the longest government shutdown President Donald Trump signed into law legislation that reopens the federal government and ends the 43-day shutdown, the longest in American history. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Trump's signature, which restores funding that has been frozen or halted for weeks, came shortly after the House voted 222-209 to send him the measure. Six Democrats joined nearly all Republicans in voting yes. Two Republicans joined most Democrats in voting no. ""So I just want to tell the American people, you should not forget this. When we come up to midterms and other things, don't forget what they've done to our country,"" Trump said. The package includes three appropriations bills through next September and keeps the rest of the government open at current levels through Jan. 30. It includes full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps and reinstates federal workers affected by the shutdown. But in a major concession from Democrats, the bill does not include an extension of enhanced subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, after Republicans held firm against extending those funds beyond this year. Although emotions are raw in the Democratic caucus over some of their senators caving, party leaders said the high-stakes showdown with Trump and the Republicans ""crystallized"" how Democrats are fighting for health care and affordability for millions of Americans. That economic message, they said, helped propel them to victory in last week's elections in Virginia and New Jersey and will help the party in 2026. Shortly before yesterday's vote, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., filed a discharge petition in a bid to bypass Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and force a future floor vote on a three-year extension of the expiring Obamacare subsidies. But it lacked the necessary support of at least four House Republicans to force a vote. More politics news: - The White House said it was unlikely that key federal inflation and labor reports impacted by the government shutdown would be released. - More than seven weeks after her special election victory, Arizona Democrat Adelita Grijalva took the oath of office, marking the end of a bitter standoff with Speaker Johnson. - Trump's directive to change the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War could cost as much as $2 billion, according to six people with knowledge of the potential cost. - A political consultant who formerly worked as chief of staff for California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been indicted on fraud and tax crime charges. - As 2028 talk heats up, Vice President JD Vance, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and others are navigating the aftermath of Republican losses in last week's elections. Epstein wrote Trump 'knew about the girls' in released emails Jeffrey Epstein referenced Trump in emails to his associate Ghislaine Maxwell and a journalist, claiming in one that Trump ""knew about the girls,"" according to emails released by House Democrats. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released three email chains, sent between 2011 and 2019, saying the documents came from the late convicted sex offender's estate as part of the committee’s investigation into the Epstein case. The emails also showed Epstein saying Clinton had ""never"" been to his private island, despite Trump's claims to the contrary. Trump and Clinton have both denied any wrongdoing and have never been charged with any criminal activity. Epstein did not accuse Trump of any wrongdoing with ""the girls."" Asked during a press briefing about the emails, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""These emails prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong."" More on the Epstein emails: - Analysis: The latest Epstein twist comes at an inopportune time for Trump, with the president already in the midst of criticism from longtime supporters over his economic rhetoric and policy proposals. Trump foes facing federal charges challenge their prosecutor Former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both frequent targets of Trump, filed separate motions in their respective cases, arguing acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Lindsey Halligan is unlawfully serving in her role and therefore the indictments against them should be thrown out. In a rare joint hearing, attorneys for Comey and James will argue their case together. Halligan, who was part of Trump's legal team in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case but has no prior prosecutorial experience, was sworn in to the job as interim U.S. attorney in one of the nation's busiest federal court districts on Sept. 22. That's three days after Erik Siebert, the U.S. attorney who had been serving in the role since Jan. 21, resigned after being pressured to indict Comey and James. The indictments against Comey and James came after Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against Comey, James and another of the president's adversaries, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Warnings rise for U.S. as severe flu strain causes outbreaks in Canada, U.K. Global health experts are increasingly worried about a new strain of the flu virus that was first reported in June. The new strain, a version of H3N2, has caused outbreaks in Canada and the U.K., where health officials have warned of the early wave that’s sending people to the hospital. Whether this strain has made it to the U.S. yet remains inconclusive. H3N2 is an A strain of influenza. While there are plenty of anecdotal reports of people testing positive for flu A across the country, the insights stop there. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn't provided a detailed, national report on flu activity since Sept. 26 because of the government shutdown.

"Everyone knows Walmart. But not everyone outside Wall Street and corporate America knows of its CEO, Doug McMillon, the same way they know of Tesla’s Elon Musk, Disney’s Bob Iger or JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon. Yet, McMillon’s impact on the American consumer over the past 12 years is arguably as big, if not bigger, than any of those three. With affordability top of mind from Main Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, he built on Walmart’s reputation for low prices while pushing the company to embrace technologies that have helped it compete with — and sometimes vanquish — its competitors. He did so while weathering economic and political headwinds that, at times, threatened to make the company the face of big business run amok. Even with critics on all sides, Walmart remains popular with shoppers. “McMillon has been a transformational leader who embraced technology to modernize WMT’s operating model and strengthen its long-term competitive positioning,” Steven Shemesh, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote using Walmart’s ticker symbol. When McMillon steps down in January, he will leave behind a company that reaches into almost every community in the country. It’s the biggest retailer and grocer in the United States, with more than 4,600 brick-and-mortar locations. Over the past decade, it has become an e-commerce giant, too. Walmart is also the largest private employer in the country, with 1.6 million U.S. associates. It’s got another 5,500 stores abroad, as well. Even Bentonville, the once-sleepy city where Walmart’s headquarters is based, has become a hot spot with fancy amenities — and high costs — more in line with major metropolitan areas than with rural Arkansas. McMillon’s tenure has been especially kind to the company’s long-term investors: Walmart’s stock price has gained about 300% since he took over in 2014. The company’s market value stands above $800 billion, comparable with JPMorgan’s and four times larger than Disney’s. McMillon, now 59, started as a Walmart associate when he was in high school in the 1980s, when the company was already well on its way to global supremacy. At the time, Walmart was criticized for gobbling up market share from five-and-dime stores in rural areas, while it also stomped over once-giant chains such as Sears, Kmart and Toys R Us. By the time McMillon climbed the ladder all the way to become Walmart’s fifth CEO in 2014, the company was king of the consumer mountain. But it was facing a new wave of competition from value-conscious rivals, from dollar-store chains to e-commerce behemoth Amazon. Walmart had also become a cultural symbol — and, sometimes, a punchline — for the struggles of working-class Americans in the country’s vast rural and exurban areas. The 1995 novel “Where the Heart Is,” later turned into a movie starring Natalie Portman, depicts a young, pregnant woman who secretly moves into a Walmart. So-called “Walmart moms” were a prized voter bloc in several recent presidential elections. Walmart is often criticized for its labor and business practices. Bernie Sanders, the progressive U.S. senator from Vermont, has ripped the company for years over what he has called its “starvation wages.” Sanders and other critics say the company doesn’t pay its fair share in taxes, while at the same time many of its hourly employees rely on food stamps and Medicaid — both taxpayer-funded safety net programs — to make ends meet. Walmart has attempted to address some concerns under McMillon. It has boosted pay and benefits for many employees and added fresher brands to its inventory while maintaining low prices. It has also supercharged its tech and e-commerce strategies, including its Walmart+ membership program, and renovated hundreds of stores. Its growth also led to some problems for customers, including scam sales from third-party sellers on Walmart's online marketplace, as well. As inflation took off starting in 2022, several of these initiatives enabled Walmart to snap up market share among families earning six-figure incomes, but who were still looking for lower prices. Walmart also emerged stronger from the early days of the Covid pandemic, ramping up its e-commerce and delivery programs and retooling its global supply chains at a time when Americans weren’t leaving home. “Doug’s leadership has focused on creating an environment where people are not afraid to experiment and try new things,” Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData, wrote in an email to NBC News. “That has helped Walmart to future-proof itself.” The company’s now-diminished rival, Target, has slumped in the post-pandemic years after struggling with supply chain and inventory snafus. Target has also faced backlash from consumers earlier this year for dropping its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and products. Walmart also backed off its DEI initiatives under pressure from the Trump administration and conservative activists — but it didn’t take anywhere near the heat that Target did. Still, the McMillon-era Walmart was never far from political controversy, including when it tightened its gun and ammunition sales in 2019 following a mass shooting in Texas. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has praised McMillon’s Walmart — and picked fights with it. In recent weeks, the president touted Walmart’s yearly Thanksgiving meal deal package as evidence his policies were making things more affordable. While it is less expensive than last year’s version, the deal includes fewer, and cheaper, items — showing that even Walmart isn’t immune to inflationary pressures. That was clear in the spring, too, when the company said it would have to raise some prices because of Trump’s tariffs. The president lashed out on social media, warning: “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain.” Walmart didn’t back off, but McMillon said on an earnings call that tariff effects were “gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted.” Indeed, the company raised its sales and profit revenue outlook for the year, heading into the holiday shopping season. And this was made possible largely because of how the company reshaped itself under McMillon’s stewardship. Even as he retires, handing off to successor John Furner, it would take a lot to “roll back” Walmart’s dominant position. “Furner is taking over one of the most desirable seats in corporate America,” wrote Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst with Truist Securities. He “just needs to continue to execute against the game plan they have already put in place.”",left
"Donald Trump declared last week on 60 Minutes that the legal dispute over his tariffs presents “the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in 100 years.” (I’m more of a Brown v. Board of Education proponent, but personal preferences vary.) The president then posited on social media that the tariff case “is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country.” Everyone’s going to live, but, yes, there’s a lot at stake. And based on oral arguments in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, Trump’s tariffs (as presently constructed) are teetering on extinction. The justices spent nearly three hours questioning Solicitor General John Sauer (representing the Trump administration), former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal (representing a group of private businesses who oppose the tariffs), and Oregon solicitor general Benjamin Gutman (speaking for 12 Democratic-led states). While the arguments got dense and weedy, we can identify two key takeaways. First, the Court’s three liberals — Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ketanji Brown Jackson — are locked in against Trump. This wasn’t tough to anticipate, and their questioning at oral argument confirmed that they will vote as a bloc to strike down the tariffs. The liberals appeared to relish the chance to turn the “major questions” doctrine — which holds that, where Congress intends to give the president powers of “vast economic or political consequence,” it must say so explicitly in a law (and hasn’t here) — back on the conservatives who used it recently to strike down Democratic initiatives, including Joe Biden’s student-loan-relief program. Listen to The Counsel podcast Subscribe on: We can’t always draw conclusions from the fact that a particular justice asked a specific question; sometimes they ask rhetorically or to expose a weakness in an opposing viewpoint. But none of the liberal justices gave any remote indication of support for the Trump administration’s position. Kagan, for example, expressed exasperation with Trump’s habitual overuse of emergency statutes like the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which he invoked to justify the tariffs: “[W]e’ve had cases recently which deal with the President’s emergency powers, and it turns out we’re in emergencies everything all the time about, like, half the world.” Sotomayor left little to the imagination: “I just don’t understand this argument … It’s a congressional power, not a presidential power, to tax. And you want to say tariffs are not taxes, but that’s exactly what they are.” (If the tariffs are in fact construed as taxes, they’re almost certainly unconstitutional if imposed by the executive branch). And Jackson minced no words: “It’s pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers of the President in IEEPA.” There’s no give here. Count three votes against Trump. Now to the second (and more important) overarching takeaway: At least three justices in the Court’s conservative middle seemed dubious about the administration’s position. Justice Amy Coney Barrett voiced skepticism at the scope of the tariffs: “[I]s it your contention that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the defense and industrial base? I mean, Spain, France?” She also noted that no prior president has used the IEEPA to impose tariffs of any kind. Chief Justice John Roberts concurred, noting that the law “had never before been used to justify tariffs. No one has argued that it does until this particular case.” Roberts (like Sotomayor) referred to the tariffs as “taxes on Americans.” And Justice Neil Gorsuch pointedly called Trump’s position “a one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people’s elected representatives.” (Read that again and remember that it’s Gorsuch, not Kagan or Sotomayor.) If you’re skeptical about the possibility of a cross-ideological majority, consider that typical party affiliations have not held in the lower trial and appeals courts. Federal judges appointed by Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Trump himself found the tariffs unconstitutional, while two dissenting Obama appointees would have upheld the president’s actions. This case likely won’t yield the foregone six-to-three, conservative-to-liberal conclusion that we’ve seen from this Court in other major cases. If the Court does strike down the tariffs, major consequences follow. First, Trump’s worldwide “Liberation Day” tariffs would end. Trump doomsaid during his 60 Minutes interview that, in that event, “I think our economy will go to hell.” But financial experts and conservative politicians alike have posited, to the contrary, that a ruling rejecting the tariffs would actually bolster the economy. Indeed, financial markets seemingly expect a Trump-administration loss. As oral arguments proceeded on Wednesday morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 290 points (about 0.6 percent) while the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite gained 0.8 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. The index that tracks small businesses — which have suffered acutely because of the tariffs — increased by 1.6 percent during the few hours of oral argument. Financial institutions are not legal experts, and markets can rise for any number of reasons, but the trend was uniform and pointed. It’s one indicator from smart people with a lot to lose. Meanwhile, American importers — who, through late September, had paid a total of over $90 billion in tariffs directly to the U.S. government — might seek repayment, though that issue could remain unresolved pending further legal wrangling. (Contrary to the common suggestion by Trump and others, foreign countries do not pay tariffs — American businesses do, and they often pass those costs on to consumers.) Barrett noted that a refund process could get messy, and she’s right. But plenty of the Court’s decisions have faced difficulty in implementation. (See Brown, for example; desegregation wasn’t exactly a breeze.) The Court also might strike down the tariffs moving forward, but rule that money already paid need not be refunded, more out of convenience than legal principle. We should know soon(ish) how the Court rules. Typically the justices issue their most important decisions at the end of the term in May or June. But here, the parties requested — and the Court granted — an expedited schedule, an acknowledgment of the stakes, and the need for certainty. The issues here are too momentous and complex to realistically expect a ruling in the next few weeks, but it’s likely we’ll know, one way or the other, by around the New Year. Based on the justices’ questioning this week, Trump should prepare for an unwelcome result.

"The Republic of Ireland will be the fastest-growing economy in the world this year because of one company and two drugs. Despite all the talk of Trump’s tariffs, US protectionism and the trend towards deglobalisation, we still reside in a globalised world, populated by behemoth companies that are themselves (in financial terms) the size of countries. Apple’s annual revenue exceeds $400 billion (€345 billion), making it bigger than Pakistan and a little smaller than Denmark in income terms. These firms, as we know from personal experience, have the financial heft to overwhelm national accounts. READ MORE Ireland’s leprechaun economics phase, coined after the economy grew by 26 per cent in 2016, came on foot of the iPhone giant’s decision to transfer a significant portion of its IP (intellectual property) here in 2015. In a report on the likely impact of US tariffs on corporation tax here, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) pinpointed another leprechaun in the national accounts, this time courtesy of pharma giant Eli Lilly. Will Imagine’s big gamble double its customer base? It traced the unprecedented surge in Irish exports earlier this year (exports rose by 153 per cent to €71 billion between January and May) to the spike in global demand for Eli Lilly’s blockbuster weight-loss drugs. The company manufactures the active ingredients for Mounjaro and Zepbound at its plant in Kinsale, Co Cork, before shipping them to the US for further development. These ingredients accounted for more than half the total of exports to the US during the period ($42.3 billion). The Department of Finance expects the Irish economy to grow – in gross domestic product (GDP) – by almost 11 per cent in 2025, 11 times the rate of growth expected for the euro zone as a whole and more than five times the rate of growth the US is expecting. This surge in GDP is almost entirely attributable to the spike in exports driven by – as the Ifac report details – Eli Lilly’s drug sales. We initially thought the surge in exports related to the pharma sector as a whole rushing to place products in the US and inside the cordon of Trump’s tariffs but we now find it relates really to just one company’s attempt to elude Trump’s tariff dragnet. The much-highlighted concentration risk at the heart of our corporation tax base is now mirrored in our exports. Ifac’s report notes that corporation tax receipts tend to be more volatile than exports for two main reasons: some pharma products are much more profitable than others, and the timing of corporation tax payments does not always match when the exports occur. Either way, Ireland is fast becoming a concentration risk itself. While Ifac’s report highlights the upside risk to corporate tax receipts here with profits in the tech sector potentially benefiting from the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution and profits in the pharma sector likely to benefit from increased demand for weight-loss and other medications, there’s a sting in the tail. This upside risk will amplify the concentration risk for the exchequer. Several senior figures, and the Department of Finance itself, believe Ireland’s winning streak on tax and investment may come a cropper after 2030. “The portion of corporate tax receipts currently deemed to be windfall are projected to decline between 2030 and 2040,” the department warned in a report last week that highlighted the challenges facing the exchequer in the coming decades. This momentum shift could be quickened if Trump’s America-First agenda seeds into the body politic there. But, as Ifac says, “for now, at least” things continue to look good on the tax front.",left
"The current federal government shutdown will become the longest in history tomorrow if a miracle resolution doesn’t appear. But aside from the federal employees who have been furloughed (or worse yet, have been forced to work without pay) since October 1, the most visible consequences began this past weekend, when federal funding for the SNAP (a.k.a. food stamps) program lapsed, potentially affecting the 42 million Americans who rely on this benefit for their daily bread. The Trump administration has claimed it has no legal way to replace any of the lapsed funds, despite the existence of a $6 billion congressionally authorized emergency fund devised for just this purpose. On Friday two different federal district judges (in Massachusetts and in Rhode Island) ordered the administration to tap the emergency fund to at least partially restore SNAP benefits as soon as possible. But both judges made it clear the government has additional resources to fully fund benefits (much like it used tariff revenue to ensure no interruption in military pay) and avoid the complications and interruptions a partial payment would involve, and gave the administration a November 3 deadline to choose a path forward or to appeal the orders. Today the Justice Department (representing USDA, which administers the SNAP program) indicated the administration would not appeal the orders but would also decline to provide for full SNAP payments, instead making the partial payments the judges required. This will create a very chaotic situation, the Associated Press noted: The administration said it would provide details to states on Monday on calculating the per-household partial benefit. The process of loading the SNAP cards, which involves steps by state and federal government agencies and vendors, can take up to two weeks in some states. But the USDA warned in a court filing that it could take weeks or even months for states to make all the system changes to send out reduced benefits. The average monthly benefit is usually about $190 per person. States were all over the map in responding to the potential funding gap even before greater uncertainty was introduced by the partial funding decision, as the Hill reported: [Some] States and territories including California, the District of Columbia, Louisiana, New York and West Virginia have deployed emergency funds to food banks and SNAP beneficiaries ahead of the anticipated halt in benefits … Food banks across the country have been preparing for an influx of people, with many already seeing increased traffic ahead of the November deadline. Governors were directing funds straight to food banks ahead of the anticipated lapse. The politics of the funding lapse and its partial resolution are also hard to immediately assess. Some Republicans have been loathe to restore SNAP benefits because the lapse might encourage Democrats to consider reopening the government on the GOP’s terms. But it’s not quite so simple, as the New York Times observes: Among the 50 congressional districts with the highest SNAP participation rates, 43 are represented by Democrats … But food assistance has a far broader and more bipartisan reach than, say, blue-state infrastructure projects that the administration has canceled during the shutdown. Other parts of the country that are also heavily reliant on SNAP supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, including much of Appalachia, predominantly Hispanic Texas border counties that swung to the right last year, and rural counties across the South and West. The hostility to SNAP that the GOP exhibited in the provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will also color public reactions to this mess, suggests the Times: The administration’s move to halt SNAP during the shutdown comes after Republicans passed steep cuts to the program in their major domestic policy bill over the summer. Arguing that food assistance was riddled with waste and fraud, Republicans expanded work requirements and shifted more of the expense of the program onto states. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the changes will push states to reduce or eliminate benefits, with 2.4 million people falling out of the program because of the work requirements alone. That the administration is choosing to fund SNAP partially rather than fully at this point could increase the political peril for Trump and his party. Even as he seeks to blame the whole situation on Democrats, Trump is grudgingly making available only half a loaf of the relief two federal judges told him that he could legally provide. It’s a churlish position to place himself in, and it could weaken rather than strengthen the Republican resolve to “win” the shutdown fight.",left

Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Two warnings for Republicans in the New Jersey governor results Analysis by Steve Kornacki Between the two gubernatorial elections yesterday, Virginia was supposed to be the lopsided one — and it was, with Democrat Abigail Spanberger crushing Republican Winsome Earle-Sears by 15 points. But New Jersey looked like it was going to be a different story. The polling was competitive, and Republicans nominated a battle-tested candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, who’d nearly won the governorship four years earlier. Recent momentum was on the GOP’s side, with President Donald Trump coming within 6 points of Kamala Harris there last year — a giant improvement from his 16-point loss in 2020. And Democrats were privately sharing alarm that their nominee, Mikie Sherrill, seemed to be wilting under the spotlight. But it was all a mirage. Sherrill walked away with a 13-point win, nearly matching Spanberger’s margin in Virginia. It’s a concerning outcome for Republicans, because the two main ingredients in the Sherrill landslide have potential ramifications that extend well beyond the borders of New Jersey. First, there are the well-to-do suburbs and bedroom communities. These are traditionally Republican areas populated with college-educated, white-collar professionals who are deeply uncomfortable with Trump. When he nearly won four years ago, Ciattarelli clawed back many of the suburban voters his party had been shedding in the Trump era. This time around, their verdict was decisive: They wanted to vote against the party of Trump. Consider Hunterdon, Morris and Somerset counties, which have the highest median incomes and the highest concentrations of white residents with college degrees in New Jersey. In each one, Ciattarelli’s margin was 12 to 14 points worse than in his 2021 campaign. But his numbers in these counties were in line with Trump’s showing last year. In fact, Ciattarelli fared worse than Trump in Morris, although some of this could be due to it being Sherrill’s home county. But what about Ciattarelli’s home base of Somerset, where he also lagged behind Trump? It demonstrates the motivation of anti-Trump suburbanites now that he’s back in office, and it suggests that further GOP erosion is possible — in New Jersey and in similar areas around the country. The other ingredient in Sherrill’s win involves nonwhite voters, with whom Trump made his biggest gains in 2024. These voters had not backed Republicans in the past, but Trump’s surprising inroads raised hope among his party — and trepidation among Democrats — that a broader shift might be underway, not just in New Jersey but nationally. In this way, Ciattarelli was a test case: Could these gains transfer to a Republican running without Trump on the ballot? The answer is a resounding no. In New Jersey municipalities that are at least 60% Hispanic (and where results are currently available), all of Trump’s 2024 gains were washed away Tuesday night. Similar results can be seen in heavily Asian American areas in Middlesex County, where Trump also made notable gains last year. Had Ciattarelli combined his suburban performance from 2021 with Trump’s 2024 inroads among nonwhite voters, he would have won. And if he could have retained at least some of both, the race would at least have been tight. That would have given Republicans a nice post-election talking point, but it also would have been a genuine source of midterm optimism for them. It would have shown that the anti-Trump suburban passions were cooling and that partywide growth with nonwhite voters was continuing apace. But Ciattarelli got neither. And as a result, he got clobbered.

Trump's tariffs draw Supreme Court scrutiny with the economy at the top of voters' minds Analysis by Andrea Mitchell Exit polls show that the big winners in yesterday’s off-year elections — Democrats Abigail Spanberger, Mikie Sherill and Zoran Mamdani — share one common denominator: They won in large part because voters are dissatisfied with how President Donald Trump is handling the economy. Their skepticism marks a significant erosion of one of the chief reasons Trump was re-elected just one year ago. And no economic policy is more identified with his second term than the one debated in today’s gripping Supreme Court argument: His unprecedented claim that imposing tariffs on a global scale is a broadly defined emergency power of the president, not Congress. Predicting Supreme Court decisions is perilous, but oral arguments indicated this case might not result in another 6-3 ideological split favoring Trump. Veteran Supreme Court observer Linda Greenhouse predicted in The New York Times that “listening might even be fun.” She was right, at least for fellow nerds like me who are fascinated by the case. But it may not have been as much fun for Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who showed up in the august Supreme Court chamber to hear the arguments in lieu of Trump, who had floated the idea of attending in person. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who argued the case for the White House, didn’t just get peppered with questions from the three liberal justices appointed by Democratic presidents. Sauer faced skeptical inquiries from conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett as well. The overriding issue: Why should the president have the power to abrogate what has for almost 250 years been deemed the legislative branch’s prerogative to raise revenues, even in emergencies? It’s what the conventionally conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page this week called Trump’s policy of “usurping Congress’s power over taxes and tariffs.” Barrett also zeroed in on retaliatory tariffs, the levies Trump has imposed on nearly all of America’s trading partners. One example arousing a lot of criticism from critics of the policy: the 50% tariff he levied against Brazil, with which the U.S. enjoys a trade surplus — not for economic reasons, but because Trump was upset former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was charged with attempting a coup after he lost re-election. More recently, Trump threatened an additional 10% levy against Canada, a key U.S. trading partner, in response to a provincial governor’s anti-tariff ad repurposing a Ronald Reagan speech. Critics of Trump’s policy argue that the impact of the tariffs is already feeding inflation, with worse effects to come. And the Canadian tariffs could have a particular impact on Rust Belt states that were key to Trump’s 2024 victory — and could be an early warning for Republicans in next year’s midterms. The erratic nature of Trump’s tariff decision-making was already unnerving U.S. allies around the world. Now, it may be feeding into the economic anxiety of voters — including those critical to Republicans’ efforts to hold onto the House next year and the future of Trump’s agenda.

"Pfizer on Tuesday raised its full-year profit forecast for the second quarter in a row as robust demand for its blockbuster blood thinner helped it post third-quarter earnings above expectations. The drugmaker, which stuck to its full-year revenue forecast for the year, has benefited from chief executive Albert Bourla’s cost-cutting initiatives, new product launches and stable demand for established drugs that have helped offset declining Covid-related sales. Pfizer’s blockbuster Covid products – the Comirnaty vaccine and Paxlovid antiviral – are now generating only a fraction of their pandemic-era sales. Demand has stabilised but remains weak as global vaccination and infection rates decline. Paxlovid sales fell 55 per cent, while those of Comirnaty were down 20 per cent in the reported quarter. Overall, Pfizer sales fell 7 per cent to $16.65 billion (€14.5 billion). The upbeat results and outlook come as Pfizer is engaged in a public legal fight with Novo Nordisk over obesity-drug developer Metsera. Novo Nordisk recently launched an unsolicited, higher bid for Metsera, which had already agreed to an acquisition by Pfizer. Pfizer’s September deal had valued Metsera at up to $7.3 billion (€6.36 billion). Pfizer has filed two lawsuits against Metsera, its board and Novo Nordisk, alleging breach of contract and antitrust violations. At an emergency hearing in one of those cases on Tuesday, a Delaware judge said there was no need for a court to grant Pfizer’s request to get involved in the bidding war for Metsera. However, vice-chancellor Morgan Zurn of Delaware’s court of chancery scheduled a hearing on Wednesday to review the process, which has led to a $10 billion bid for Metsera from Novo Nordisk, topping Pfizer’s amended $8.1 billion offer. Novo Nordisk has rejected Pfizer’s allegations and said it closely adhered to all of the restrictions under the Pfizer merger agreement. In related news, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk plan to announce new drug pricing deals with the White House, including for their weight-loss medicines, in return for Medicare coverage of their products, it was reported on Tuesday. Under the deal, the companies would offer the lowest dose of their respective obesity drugs at $149 per month, the report said, citing sources familiar with the matter. The agreement could be announced later this week. Pfizer in the third quarter became the first big pharmaceutical company to sign a deal with the Trump administration to lower the price of its prescription drugs in the Medicaid programme in exchange for three years of tariff relief. Mr Bourla said the deal will provide “greater clarity” to its business. Sales of its blood thinner Eliquis rose 22 per cent to $2.02 billion, revenue from its heart disease drug, sold under the brand names Vyndaqel and Vyndamax, rose 7 per cent to $1.59 billion. On an adjusted basis, Pfizer, which employs about 5,000 people at five plants in Ireland, earned 87 US cents per share in the quarter, compared with analysts’ expectations of 63 cents per share. Total sales for the quarter came in $16.65 billion, compared with analysts’ average expectation of $16.58 billion. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $3 to $3.15 per share, up from its previous guidance of $2.90 to $3.10. – Reuters",left
"For all the wailing and gnashing of teeth by Democrats unhappy with the deal to reopen the federal government, and for all the talk about a Democratic “civil war,” pretty much everyone in the party agrees the longest government shutdown in history didn’t work out that well for them. The lawmakers who “caved” and voted to end the stalemate thought there was no real chance to secure any of the big concessions they had originally demanded — particularly an Obamacare-subsidy extension. Those who didn’t want to cave despaired of giving up with so little to show for the effort. Some in the latter camp appeared to have objected not so much to the surrender but its timing; giving in so soon after the big November 4 Democratic election sweep effectively killed the vibe. Unfortunately, Democrats won’t have much time to sort through the ashes of the saga before they face another decision point. Funding for the federal government (aside from the agencies covered by the three freestanding appropriations bills included in the reopening package) will expire again on January 30 as both parties begin to gear up for the 2026 midterm elections. What will congressional Democrats do then, particularly if the activists and influencers who are currently so angry at “Senate sellouts” remain convinced their representatives need to do much more to stand up to Trump? Do they filibuster another GOP spending bill at the risk of triggering another shutdown? And if so, will they do a better job of developing strategic benchmarks for an acceptable conclusion? Or is January close enough to the midterms that Democrats will simply stand pat and count on voters to bust up Trump’s governing trifecta in November? Overall, the odds that Democrats will choose to repeat the experience they just underwent are low. Here are several questions Democrats have to consider that will determine what happens when the current deal runs out at the end of January. . What happens with the Obamacare-subsidy vote next month? A side deal accompanied the bill to reopen the government: a commitment from Senate Majority Leader John Thune to hold a vote by the second week in December on extending Obamacare subsidies. There were not, as far as we know, many details agreed to, other than Thune’s public comments that a one-year extension, perhaps with conditions (such as potentially deal-killing abortion restrictions), will be on the table, subject to negotiations beginning now. There is not, notably, any commitment whatsoever from House Republicans to hold a vote on these subsidies. And so far, Trump, whom Democrats had hoped would impose an Obamacare-subsidy extension on his troops, has categorically refused even to talk about it (instead, he has been bitching about Obamacare itself). Suffice it to say the odds of enacted legislation extending Obamacare subsidies before the expiration takes effect on January 1 are low. But having bitten that bullet, Republicans are very unlikely to give in to demands that they reverse course in late January. So unless Democrats simply want to make sure every single American knows about the GOP’s hostility to the subsidies, there’s not much point in again triggering a government shutdown keyed to this issue. . What other outrages will Trump commit between now and late January? Part of the deal to reopen the government was a ban on the kind of public-employee layoffs the administration has threatened and sometimes carried out in 2025. That’s a significant curb on the authoritarian outrages that had a lot to do with Democrats’ decision to risk a government shutdown at the end of September. Will Trump comply with this ban? Will he and his government-hating OMB director, Ross Vought, come up with new ways to attack congressionally authorized federal programs and the employees who work for them without obtaining the legal authority to do so? And on a separate front entirely, will Trump have taken other actions (e.g., sending military forces into more Democratic-run cities or intensifying the brutality of ICE/Border Control mass-deportation measures) signaling indifference to laws and the Constitution that will require some dramatic Democratic gesture in protest? . Will the Supreme Court green-light more Trump power grabs? While this possible development may not come to pass until the end of the current Supreme Court term in June or July, a significant number of cases and emergency appeals are pending before or heading toward the U.S. Supreme Court that could have a major bearing on Trump’s efforts to build a truly imperial presidency. These include challenges to his tariff authority, objections to his deployment of National Guard units, possible curbs on his use of emergency powers, a potential scrapping of Voting Rights Act protections against massive racial gerrymandering, and much more. If congressional Democrats get the sense they are the only obstacle to creeping authoritarianism and/or that Trump will be allowed to rig the 2026 midterms, they may be willing to throw themselves in the way by shutting down a government that has become fully enemy turf. . What does public opinion look like? Trump is an unpopular president whose unpopularity has only deepened during the latest government shutdown, in part because of incessant Democratic messaging about his destructive and callous health-care policies. Trump believes the shutdown was largely responsible for the 2025 election debacle, which suggests he may be eager to avoid another and that Democrats may be willing to welcome a reprise. But public opinion can be fickle. If Trump’s unpopularity continues to intensify, particularly if it stems from largely nonlegislative causes like his inability to deal with higher living costs or a backlash against Stephen Miller’s reckless war on Blue America, Democrats may prefer to let the GOP stew in its own juices rather than drawing undue attention to themselves. At the same time, if it looks as if the House or even the Senate is in a position to flip in the midterms, Republicans may pick fights all year long in an effort to polarize the electorate in their favor and then Democrats could be forced to fight back. . Who sets strategy for congressional Democrats in 2026? If we learned anything from both the March debacle when Democrats threatened but then abandoned a government-shutdown bid and the actual shutdown now ending, it’s that coming up with a legislative strategy that unites Democrats in and out of Congress is really hard. That’s true in part because there is no recognized party leadership (there rarely is unless your party controls the White House) and because there will inevitably be differences of opinion between senators who actually have the power to obstruct the majority party and House members whose job is mostly to lose vote after vote while making as much noise as possible. Another problem that’s particularly pressing right now is that Chuck Schumer, an already weak Senate leader, has been weakened further by the end of the shutdown and may not survive for long. The absence of a clear strategy and an agreement on how the shutdown should end was obvious all along. There’s no reason to assume more effective congressional leadership will arise next year. This last factor could lead to exactly the kind of decisions that brought Democrats to their current position in Congress or convince them to turn over the job of fighting Trump to the party base and the midterm electorate.

"The Switch 2’s popularity has exceeded even Nintendo’s anticipations, with the company raising its sales forecast for the console by more than 25 percent. In its latest earnings release, covering April 1st to September 30th, Nintendo now predicts that it’ll sell 19 million Switch 2 units by March 2026, compared to its previous forecast of 15 million. Nintendo is raising its Switch 2 sales expectations The company is now expecting to sell 19 million Switch 2 units by March 2026. The company is now expecting to sell 19 million Switch 2 units by March 2026. The Japanese gaming giant reports that 10.36 million Switch 2 consoles have been sold so far following its launch in June, with 4.54 million sales falling under its latest earnings period. 20.62 million Switch 2 games have also been sold since launch, though Nintendo has only raised its Switch 2 game forecast from 45 million to 48 million. The combined hardware and software sales are driving a 110 percent surge in revenue, which increased to ¥1,099.5 billion (around $7.1 billion) between April and September, compared to ¥523.2 billion (around $3.4 billion) for the same period last year. Nintendo also increased its end-of-year sales forecast to ¥2,250 billion (around $14.6 billion), and said it’s taken US tariff measures into consideration for these revisions. While the Switch 2 is the fastest-selling game console of all time, the first Switch console is also still creeping up in sales. The Switch has now hit 154.01 million lifetime sales, just shy of the 154.02 million total units sold for the DS, which still reigns as Nintendo’s most successful console. After dethroning the DS, the Switch then just needs to surpass 160 million sales to become the best-selling console of all time — a record set by Sony’s PlayStation 2 last year. By comparison, the Wii U sold just 13.7 million units over its entire lifetime, a figure that the Switch 2 is pretty much guaranteed to surpass before its first birthday.",left
"Europe’s economic prosperity is “geared towards a world that is gradually disappearing”, Christine Lagarde said on Friday, imploring the bloc’s policymakers to finally overcome “years of inaction”. In a scathing speech, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB) warned that Europe’s “old growth model” had become outdated, as its dependence on exports had become a “vulnerability”. Making the keynote address at the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt, Lagarde pointed to a two-year-old ECB forecast that predicted that euro area exports would grow by about 8 per cent by mid-2025. “In reality, they have not grown at all,” she said. READ MORE Without directly mentioning Germany, she said that “countries with large manufacturing sectors” had faced “a prolonged slump in industrial production”. In Germany, the bloc’s largest economy, manufacturing output fell to 2005 levels over the summer, with carmakers and the wider engineering sector falling into crisis. Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel painted a less negative picture in a speech later on Friday at the same conference. While Europe had fallen behind the US in terms of productivity growth and “could and should do better”, Mr Nagel stressed that “a closer look suggests that Europe’s standard of living compared to the US has developed less badly”. He insisted that Europe’s position “may not be as dire as it is often portrayed to be”. Ms Lagarde urged European Union (EU) policymakers to respond by strengthening the domestic economy, which she said was already showing “latent strengths”. “Our experience this year has shown that a resilient domestic economy can shield Europe against global turbulence,” she said. How AI is beginning to wreak havoc in the jobs market Across the euro area, growth this year has been slightly stronger than central bankers and most analysts had expected. In the third quarter, GDP grew at twice the expected pace, as French output expanded at its fastest rate since 2023. After a series of eight cuts in interest rates since mid-2024, which halved borrowing costs to 2 per cent, the ECB has kept monetary policy unchanged since June. Ms Lagarde called on policymakers to double down on existing domestic strengths by removing internal barriers to trade, pointing to a forthcoming ECB analysis showing that current hurdles were equivalent to a 100 per cent tariff on services and a 65 per cent tariff on goods. Ms Lagarde accused policymakers of squandering the past six years, during which “our internal market has stood still”, and warned of a slide into slow but steady decline. “Another six years of inaction – and lost growth – would not just be disappointing. It would be irresponsible,” she said. Europe’s economic weaknesses “do not trigger dramatic crises” but “erode growth quietly, as each new shock nudges us on to a slightly lower trajectory”, Lagarde said. Over time, she said, this added up to a “material” setback to growth and productivity. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025",left
"It’s the Trump ship that never sails. The president was back at it on Monday, promising an imminent solution to America’s growing health care crisis — on which he has repeatedly failed to deliver in the past. “I tell you, we’re going to be working on that very hard over the next short period of time, where the people get the money,” President Donald Trump said, referring specifically to Americans thrown into crisis by expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. “We’re talking about trillions and trillions of dollars, where the people get the money,” he added, without giving details about a vague idea to send cash to affected policyholders to replace subsidies while bypassing insurance firms. Trump’s off-the-cuff answer was a typical example of the waffle he sometimes conjures to escape a jam in a photo-op. But he could not disguise the downside of his “win” in the government shutdown, which looks set to end after Democrats failed to secure their top demand: the extension of those enhanced Obamacare subsidies. Trump and Republicans once again own the issue of health care, with millions of citizens — not just those on ACA plans — afflicted by rising premiums and high deductibles against the backdrop of a wider cost-of-living crisis. And just as in his first term, Trump lacks a comprehensive, detailed plan to bring relief to citizens who lack health care, who can’t afford the plans they have or who know that the loss of a job could leave them without any coverage at all. If the GOP cannot fix the immediate issue of the subsidies — and convince voters they have a serious solution to this and other affordability questions — their 2026 midterm election hopes could take a dive. Trump’s fogginess on health care is nothing new. Repeated unfulfilled promises to act took their place alongside his much-lampooned “infrastructure weeks” as punch lines in his first term. Trump’s pledges to replace Obamacare shimmered with hyperbole but delivered nothing, and the 2010 law survives despite multiple Republican efforts to destroy it. During the 2016 campaign, Trump pledged to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something “terrific.” At rallies, he promised Americans new health care that would cost less but be far better. If that sounds impossible, it’s probably because it is. Early in his first term, Trump promised that change was on the way. “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!” he wrote on the website formerly known as Twitter in March 2017. The GOP failure to repeal Obamacare, partly because it couldn’t come up with an alternative, didn’t stop Trump’s sunny predictions. “The Republican Party will be soon be known as theparty of health care,” the president declared in March 2019. Second term, same as the first. In his debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in 2024, Trump was mocked for saying he had “concepts of a plan” to make health care “better and less expensive.” More than a year later — and despite some significant efforts by Trump to bring down the cost of some prescription drugs — Americans are still waiting for his wider solutions. Republican divisions boil over health care The fight over health care was not just at the center of the government shutdown battle with Democrats. It’s tearing at Republican Party unity. It’s even estranged Trump and one of his most outspoken supporters, Marjorie Taylor Greene. The Georgia representative broke ranks early in the shutdown to highlight ACA insurance premiums for her family that she said would double in price due to expiring subsidies. While no fan of the ACA, she lashed out at her own party. “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” Greene wrote on X in October. Greene’s persistent criticism is a warning sign for House Speaker Mike Johnson after he called back the House to vote on the Senate plan to reopen the government this week. It might explain why he was so keen to keep the chamber dark during a shutdown that set internal GOP dissent simmering. Greene further distanced herself from Trump on Monday, saying on X that he should spend less time meeting foreign leaders and instead hold “nonstop” meetings on domestic policy. The president told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “I don’t know what happened to Marjorie. She’s a nice woman, but I don’t know what happened. She’s lost her way, I think.” Greene then told CNN, “I haven’t lost my way. I’m 100% America first and only!” Greene might now be regarded as a MAGA heretic by some in Trump’s orbit. But her comments on health care raise another possibility — that she’s far more in tune with the economic insecurity felt by regular Americans than a billionaire president and his wealthy Cabinet. She’s not alone. During the shutdown, a group of endangered House Republicans wrote to Johnson to urge him to address expiring enhanced ACA subsidies when the government reopens. “While we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it,” they wrote. Senate Republican leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote in December on extending enhanced Obamacare subsidies as part of the deal with moderate Democrats to reopen the government. Chances of a Democrat-written bill passing are slim. But the vote will put GOP senators on the record and on a political spot. Johnson hasn’t pledged to hold a similar vote — one reason why progressive Democrats are angry about centrist Senate Democrats’ compromise to end the shutdown. The speaker told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” Monday that he’d always been willing to talk about rising health care costs, but that Democrats had squandered weeks of valuable time by triggering the shutdown last month. He promised debate on a plan to get to the “root cause” of the health care issue. But that is unlikely to help ACA policyholders forced to decide now whether to give up health plans they can’t afford or pay punitively rising premiums. Johnson could not tell Tapper whether there’d be a vote on this issue soon. “I’m not committing to it or not committing to it. What I’m saying is that we do a deliberative process. It’s the way this always works and we have to have time to do that,” the speaker said. But the tiny GOP majority gives little cause for optimism that an issue as complex and divisive as health care reform is something the fractious GOP and an absent president could handle. One tangible gain for Democrats in the shutdown drama was their highlighting of the ACA issue and attacks on Republicans for failing to fix health care. In an NBC News poll taken last month during the shutdown, 10% of respondents cited the cost of health care premiums as the single top issue deciding their vote for Congress next year. And 49% of respondents said Democrats would do a better job dealing with health care compared with 26% who thought the same of Republicans Many Democrats are furious that their moderate Senate colleagues made a deal with Republicans to reopen the government because they see it as a betrayal of Americans on the health care issue. But Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who helped broker the deal and joined seven others in the Democratic caucus to back it, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan the deal would show whether Republicans were serious. “Finally, because of the shutdown fight, we’ve had a number of Republicans who have figured out that this is an issue for them,” the New Hampshire Democrat said. “So, now we’ll see. We’ll see if they are really going to work with us to make sure that Americans can afford their health insurance.” Viewing Democratic tactics, a cynic might wonder whether the party, which failed to make the enhanced Obamacare credits permanent during the Biden administration, laid a trap for Republicans on an issue their rivals always failed to solve, especially under Trump. But some Republicans don’t buy the idea that the party is vulnerable on health care, arguing that Democrats would be blamed for higher costs. GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt told CNN that “I think people know that Democrats own Obamacare, and it’s been a disaster.” How Trump has tried to lower some health care costs Republicans argue that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” domestic policy law had already made significant steps to make health care more affordable by loosening the power of insurance companies and by restoring choice and control, partly by handing more responsibility to the states. But multiple health care analysts and groups say that the bill’s cuts to Medicaid funding could leave millions vulnerable to losing coverage and threaten many rural hospitals with closure. The administration has several initiatives designed to reduce the costs of prescription drugs for Americans. It plans to launch TrumpRx, a direct-to-consumer website, early next year. Last week, the president unveiled a plan to make certain obesity drugs available for as little as $149 in an arrangement that gives pharmaceutical firms like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk tariff breaks. If this plan works, it could be lifesaving for many patients who can’t get the drugs through their insurers and can’t afford out-of-pocket prices to buy them. The initiative reflects Trump’s willingness to use government power to intervene in markets, which has also been seen in other sectors, and which flies in the face of conservative orthodoxy. A plan he recently floated to send money directly to ACA policyholders, instead of offering subsidies, also seems to spring from a similar motivation to shake up the industry. Yet the idea is fraught with uncertainties, including whether such payments would cover the shortfall of all the subsidies. Another question is whether it would simply make up the shortfall in subsidies to pay for premiums. Or would it be a separate payment that patients could use to pay for the costs of treatment directly? In the latter case of a payment that bypasses insurance firms, recipients might be exposed to massive costs if they get an adverse diagnosis. Trump told Fox News on Monday evening that he didn’t want money to go to insurance companies but that it would go into a separate account so people could negotiate their own, better health insurance. “They’re going to feel like entrepreneurs,” Trump said. But he gave no details of how such a complex scheme could help policyholders now, and did not explain how it would lower costs. And spiking health costs don’t only afflict ACA policyholders. If the government sent cash to certain Americans, how would that be fair to other taxpayers? And wouldn’t state-financed payments for health care go against everything the GOP believes? Such thorny questions, and the president’s past failures to deliver on health care, explain the Republican Party’s new but familiar political nightmare on an issue that causes anxiety for tens of millions of voters.

"Canada's top diplomat says Ottawa is working fast to advance India trade deal Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand says Canada and India will move quickly to get a trade deal after two years of strained relations TORONTO -- Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand said Monday that Canada and India will move quickly to advance a trade deal after two years of strained relations, noting Ottawa has a new foreign policy in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war. Anand's statement follows a meeting between Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Group of 20 summit in South Africa this past weekend, where the leaders agreed to restart stalled talks for a new trade deal. Relations between Canada and India have been strained since Canadian police accused New Delhi of playing a role in the June 2023 assassination of a Canadian Sikh activist near Vancouver. “The leaders were adamant that this work proceed as quickly as possible so that timing is going to be expeditious,” Anand said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Carney will visit India early next year. Anand noted Carney's goal to double non-U.S. trade over the next decade. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and more than 75% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. Most exports to the U.S. are exempted by the USMCA trade agreement but that deal is up for review in 2026. “This is a completely new approach to foreign policy that is responsive to the global economic environment in which we find ourselves,” Anand said. “There is a new government, a new foreign policy, a new prime minister and a new world order where countries are becoming more protectionist and this is a moment for Canada as a trading nation."" Canada is also seeking better relations with Beijing. Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping took a step toward mending the long-fractured ties between their countries last month with a meeting at the Asia-Pacific summit. In 2023, Ottawa suspended trade talks after going public with allegations from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that the Indian government was behind an assassination of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Nijjar, 45, was fatally shot in his pickup truck after he left the Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland. Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Niijar’s murder and are awaiting trial in Canada. Relations improved in June when Carney invited Modi to the G7 summit in Alberta and when both countries agreed to restore their top diplomats in August. “This is a step by step process. And in the last six months, significant steps have been taken,” Anand said. Anand said both countries expect to be able to double bilateral trade by 2030, to US$50 billion, and noted that Canada is India’s seventh largest trade partner for goods and services, and one of the largest foreign investors in India. Trump ended trade talks with Carney after the Ontario provincial government ran an anti-tariff advertisement in the U.S., which upset him. That followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over the president’s insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. Anand said Canada remains ready to resume trade talks with Trump. “We are operating under the fact that the United States has fundamentally changed all of its trading relationships,"" Anand said. “We look forward to getting back to the table.”",left
"A 107% U.S. import tax on Italian pasta could make your favorite spaghetti pricier — or hard to find Americans may soon be paying more for their favorite Italian pasta brands — or even have trouble finding imported spaghetti — as the Trump administration eyes a new import duty on 13 of Italy's largest pasta exporters. The proposal, published by the Commerce Department in September, would add a new 92% antidumping duty after a U.S. government probe found that some Italian pasta brands, including La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, were selling their products below U.S. market prices. Combined with the existing 15% tariff on European Union imports, the total duties on Italian-made pasta could rise to 107%. That would represent one of the Trump administration's highest import duty rates on any product, according to the Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported on the pasta dispute. If the anti-dumping duty goes into effect, the impact on American consumers would be substantial, according to Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru. Some Italian pasta makers may simply stop exporting their products to the U.S., while others might raise their prices, he added. ""You don't have enough domestic manufacturing to fill up those shelves,"" Lempert said. ""So you're going to walk into the pasta aisle and you're going to see it half empty."" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS News, ""Italian pasta is not 'disappearing.'"" He added that the antidumping duty is a proposal and that it is not yet final. ""The pasta makers still have several months to continue participating in this review before this preliminary finding becomes finalized,"" he said. Yet some Italian pasta companies are preparing to pull out of U.S. stores as soon as January because of the threat of the new antidumping duty, according to the Wall Street Journal. Which pasta brands could be affected? The antidumping duties — a type of federal tariff applied to imported products sold in the U.S. for less than their market value — would impact 13 Italian pasta makers, including La Molisana and Garofalo, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce publication. The companies did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment. - Agritalia - Aldino - Antiche Tradizioni Di Gragnano - Barilla - Gruppo Milo - La Molisana - Pastificio Artigiano Cav. Giuseppe Cocco - Pastificio Chiavenna - Pastificio Liguori - Pastificio Lucio Garofalo - Pastificio Sgambaro - Pastificio Tamma - Rummo What comes next for Italian pasta Desai, the White House spokesperson, told CBS News that the companies in question failed to adhere to multiple data requests from the Commerce Department as part of a long-running probe into Italian pasta makers that has been ongoing since the mid-1990s. Desai added that there's no ""hard date"" for when the duties would take effect. The Commerce Department and International Trade Administration did not immediately respond to CBS News' requests for comment. American pasta makers have long accused their Italian rivals of unfairly undercutting them on price. But the Commerce Department's proposal may mark a tipping point for Italian exporters that rely heavily on the U.S. market. Last year, the U.S. imported pasta from Italy valued at $684 million, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, which offers global trade data.",left

"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. In a case where Chief Justice John Roberts stares down a president’s signature agenda item, the decisions can hinge on what Roberts sees as a tax. That’s what happened with the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, when Roberts shocked conservatives and Republicans by upholding the law and its since-repealed requirement that people must pay a fine, or a tax, if they did not buy health insurance. Now Roberts is faced with Trump’s tariffs, which are obviously a tax, but which the president says are a tool. Unwinding the tariffs, Trump warned in a wee-hours social media post Tuesday, could cost the government trillions of dollars. It was both an indication of the pressure justices are under with this case and a reminder that Trump unilaterally raised taxes by imposing tariffs. He has also suggested a possible $2,000 rebate for US taxpayers. When the Supreme Court heard oral arguments last week in a challenge to Trump’s sweeping use of emergency powers to impose taxes on nearly all imports, Roberts’ view of taxes came up. I talked to CNN’s Chief Supreme Court Analyst Joan Biskupic about the arguments and how the justices will approach a case that touches nearly the entire US economy and tests the plain language of the Constitution. Our conversation, conducted by phone and edited for length and clarity, is below. Does Roberts think tariffs are a tax, too? WOLF: The thing that struck me about the oral arguments is that the tariff case could ultimately hinge on whether Chief Justice John Roberts believes tariffs are taxes. It made me think of Obamacare, the law that Roberts saved, in part because he deduced that the individual mandate was a tax. Is that a good way to frame this? BISKUPIC: There are some parallels with the two major presidential initiatives, Obama’s in 2012, and Trump’s now. And there are some parallels with the word “tax.” But let me give you some context that will help you decide whether there is more to this case than just saying a tariff could be a tax. There are several cross-currents here, and we’re not sure what will be overriding for the justices. For example, we heard concerns that the president was usurping congressional power. In the opposite direction, we heard concerns about inhibiting the executive’s power over foreign relations. Will Roberts try to strike down Trump’s tariffs? WOLF: If Roberts views tariffs as a tax, does that suggest he will oppose Trump’s actions since the Constitution gives Congress the power to tax? BISKUPIC: Roberts said plenty during the Q and A suggesting he does view tariffs as a tax. But that isn’t the end of things. As he said at one point: So the tariffs are a tax and that’s a core power of Congress. But they are, and I’m going to quote him, “a foreign-facing tax.” And he went on to tell the lawyer for the challengers, “Foreign affairs is a core power of the executive. And I don’t think you can dismiss the consequences.” So being able to label these tariffs as a kind of tax doesn’t mean they will definitely be struck down. During the Q and A, there was also some question of whether the tariffs could be compared to licenses, which could have more regulatory breadth than a pure income-generating tax. Did Congress give away its power over tariffs? WOLF: I was a little surprised there wasn’t more discussion during oral arguments that the Constitution specifically gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs. Why not? BISKUPIC: Congress can cede some of that power through legislation. And the question is: Did Congress give certain tariff power to the president in the IEEPA (International Emergency Economic Powers Act)? Usually, tariff authority is specific, carefully delineated by Congress. But the IEEPA doesn’t even mention the word “tariff.” The Trump administration argues that the IEEPA language relating to the “regulation” of “importation” is broad enough to cover tariffs. Lower courts disagreed. Will the Court be thinking about its own image? WOLF: These tariffs are a major part of Trump’s agenda that he promised during the campaign. The scale of them means they touch much of the US economy. To what extent are the justices likely to be talking about the scale of it, and whether deference should be given to the president because of the election? Are they going to be mindful of the external context? BISKUPIC: In some cases, the external becomes the internal. Issues related to executive power weigh especially on this conservative majority. And the court has ruled over time, not just in today’s conservative era, that a president has broad authority when it comes to foreign affairs. So that’s in the atmosphere, as well as the fact that this is a signature initiative of the president. Just as was the situation with Obamacare. So whatever the court does will be viewed as either a major stamp of approval or a major rejection. And I don’t think you can discount that the justices are concerned about whether people have confidence in the court, that it is not simply a tool of the administration. All these factors make this a very close case. I think many of the justices, especially the chief, are mindful that there’s this public narrative that the court is always siding with Donald Trump. Now, they don’t like that narrative. They don’t believe that narrative. But it’s there. I’m not saying these factors would be decisive, but I don’t think we can discount them. Are the justices intimidated? WOLF: Justices have talked about their concerns over safety. Do you think that they are afraid or intimidated at the thought of crossing Trump in a big way? BISKUPIC: No. I don’t think so. Just to break down the nine: I think we’ve got three justices who are going to be with him on this tariff dispute: Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh. Solidly against him on this issue seem to be Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. In the middle would be the chief and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. I don’t think any of the three worry about crossing Trump, as you put it. And you mentioned safety. I’d say that is a general concern across the judiciary, but these justices have full-time security. Frankly, it’s the lower-court judges who have more real fears about safety. They’re on the front lines and unaccustomed to being so much in the public eye. And I do not think any of the justices feel like they can’t vote a certain way because they’re going to draw out President Trump’s wrath. In many cases, they’re with him anyway. That’s the bottom line for this conservative supermajority court. They are very much aligned with Donald Trump on the law. Roberts will likely try to build a coalition WOLF: What are you expecting from the decision? BISKUPIC: I think the chief, with a case of this magnitude, will want to write the court’s opinion. Going into the case, the momentum was with the challengers because of how lower courts ruled. And maybe the justices are going that way, too. But remember we saw only a glimpse of their views in oral arguments. They’ve taken a private vote by now and are beginning negotiations that will take months. As I said, there are cross-currents here. I don’t necessarily think votes will shift. But with Obamacare, the chief made multiple vote switches. So it ain’t over till it’s over. Roberts changed his mind on Obamacare WOLF: Why did he change at the last minute? BISKUPIC: In the beginning, he was with fellow conservatives to strike Obamacare down under the Commerce Clause. But then he decided he could uphold it under Congress’ taxing power. This is why you made a connection between this case and that one on the word “tax.” A bigger majority is better WOLF: That’s interesting that they have to negotiate with each other to get to something they can all agree on or a majority will agree on. BISKUPIC: Exactly. Five votes are needed for a majority, but the chief might want to try for more, with more compromises — because it is such a big case and so much at stake for President Trump and his agenda.",left
"As Black women face unemployment challenges, policymaker roundtable seeks solutions Policymakers, organizers and business owners have gathered to tackle how to address rising unemployment among Black women In a packed room at library in a downtown Boston, Rep. Ayanna Pressley posed a blunt question: Why are Black women, who have some of the highest labor force participation rates in the country, now seeing their unemployment rise faster than most other groups? The replies Monday from policymakers, academics, business owners and community organizers laid out how economic headwinds facing Black women may indicate a troubling shift for the economy at large. The unemployment rate for Black women increased from 6.7% to 7.5% between August and September this year, the most recent month for available data because of the federal government shutdown. That compares with a 3.2% to 3.4% increase for white women over the same period. And it extended a year-long trend of the Black women's unemployment rate increasing at a time of broad economic uncertainty. Many roundtable attendees view those numbers as both an affront and a warning about the uneven pressures on Black women. “Everyone is missing out when we’re pushed out of the workforce,” said Pressley, a progressive Democrat. “That is something that I worry about now, that you have all these women with specific expertise and specializations that we’re being deprived of.” And when Black women do have work, she said they tend to be “woefully underemployed.” Black women had the highest labor force participation rate of any female demographic in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, yet their unemployment rate remains higher than other demographics of women. Historically, their unemployment rate has trended slightly above the national average, widening during periods of slowed economic growth or recession. Black Americans are overrepresented in industries like retail, health and social services, and government administration, according to a 2024 Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey. “Black women are at the center of the Venn diagram that is our society,” said Anna Gifty Opoku-Agyeman, a PhD candidate in public policy and economics at the Harvard Kennedy School. She pointed to April as the month when Black women’s unemployment began to diverge more sharply from other groups. A policy agenda that ignores the causes, she said, could harm the broader economy. Popular Reads Roundtable participants cited many long-standing structural inequities but attributed most of the latest divergence to recent federal actions. They blamed the Trump administration's downsizing of the Minority Business Development Agency and the cancellation of some federal contracts with non-profits and small businesses, saying those actions disproportionately impacted Black women. Others said tariff policies and mass federal layoffs also contributed to the strain. The administration's opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives was repeatedly mentioned by participants as a cause for a more hostile environment for Black women to find employment, customers or government contracting. There is no concrete data on how many Black federal workers were laid off, fired or otherwise dismissed as part of President Donald Trump's sweeping cuts through the federal government. The attendees discussed a wide range of potential solutions to the unemployment rate for Black women, including using state budgets to bolster business development for Black women, expanding microloans to different communities, increasing government resources for contracting, requiring greater transparency on corporate hiring practices and encouraging state and federal officials to enforce anti-discrimination policies. “I feel like I was just at church,” said Ruthzee Louijeune, the Boston City Council president, as the meeting wrapped up. She encouraged attendees to keep up their efforts, and she defended DEI policies as essential to a healthy workforce and political system. Without broad-based efforts, the Democrat said, the country’s business and political leadership would be “abnormal” and weakened. “Any space that does not look like our country and like our cities is not normal,” she said, “and not the city or country we are trying to build.""",left

"What the Trump tariffs Supreme Court case could mean for the economy The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments about Trump's tariffs on Wednesday. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Wednesday in a case that will determine the fate of President Donald Trump’s steepest tariffs, carrying implications for prices paid by shoppers and interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, economists told ABC News. The nation’s highest court will weigh in on the lawfulness of far-reaching levies on dozens of countries unveiled in a Rose Garden ceremony that Trump dubbed ""Liberation Day."" The case also concerns tariffs imposed on China, Mexico and Canada, as well as a baseline 10% levy slapped on nearly all imports. The ruling could impact tens of billions in tax revenue and alter trade agreements struck with some of the largest U.S. trade partners, including the United Kingdom and China. Some economists who spoke to ABC News said the case could alter costs borne by U.S. households and hiring decisions made by companies, though the effect may be limited since the Trump administration will likely seek to reimpose tariffs under other legal authorities. Still, the economists added, the court’s ruling could have a profound impact on the U.S. economy for years to come, since a unilateral executive power to impose tariffs would establish a new lever for policies like taxation and trade at the heart of economic stewardship. “The stakes are really high for the economy because tariffs have an effect on trade not only in the U.S. but across the globe,” Raymond Robertson, a professor of trade, economics and public policy at Texas A&M University, told ABC News. Trump has repeatedly defended his legal authority to impose the tariffs and warned of economic damage if they were to be struck down. “If we don’t win that case, we will be a weakened, troubled financial mess for many, many years to come,” Trump said last month at a White House event. “And if we do, we’re going to be the most powerful economic country in the world.” Trump ratcheted up tariffs in recent months, in part due to powers invoked under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the legal authority at issue before the Supreme Court. Tariffs stand at an overall average effective rate of 17.9%, the highest since 1934, the Yale Budget Lab found last week. Price levels are expected to climb incrementally this year as a result of the levies, representing a loss of about $1,800 for the average household, the group said. “Higher tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods, resulting in higher overall inflation,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last week, though he said the most likely outcome is a merely temporary price hike. Inflation ticked up to 3% in September, reaching its highest level since January. Meanwhile, hiring has slowed in recent months, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as ""stagflation."" If the Supreme Court allows Trump’s steepest tariffs to stand, price increases may accelerate while economic uncertainty associated with the tariffs could put downward pressure on hiring, some economists said. “If the tariffs are here to stay, then I would expect this leads to more price increases to come by those who have, for now, held back and not changed prices yet because they’re unsure about the permanence of these tariffs,” Felix Tintelnot, a professor of economics at Duke University, told ABC News. Those economic conditions could make policy decisions more difficult for the Fed, since the central bank must balance a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment, Tintelnot added, saying the Supreme Court decision may influence the level of interest rates. “If we remove these tariffs, it would reduce the inflationary pressure and that might give the Fed more room to cut interest rates than if we kept these tariffs for longer,” Tintelnot said. Tariffs issued under the legal authority at question before the Supreme Court have accounted for about $90 billion in tariff revenue, raising a possibility of the funds being returned if the justices deem the tariffs unlawful, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found. The ruling could in turn hold implications for the nation's federal debt, the group said. Still, some economists said the Supreme Court case would have little effect on inflation or interest rates due to the sheer size and inertia of the U.S. economy, as well as the Trump administration’s plans to impose tariffs under other legal authorities. Trump would still retain the power to impose sector-specific tariffs and the ability to impose a 15% tariff for up to 150 days under the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to address trade disparities with other countries. “There will be efforts to rebuild the current set of tariffs even if these are struck down,” Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told ABC News. “Importers in no way, shape or form should anticipate that even if these are struck down, that these tariffs are going away.” The Trump administration touts tariffs as part of a wider set of “America First economic policies,” which have “sparked trillions of dollars in new investment in U.S. manufacturing, technology, and infrastructure,” according to the White House's website. A Supreme Court ruling against the president’s steepest tariffs could scuttle some of the promised investment and country-by-country trade agreements, some economists said, but they cast doubt on the staying power of the commitments regardless of the court’s decision. “These deals are fuzzy,” Matias Vernengo, a professor of economics at Bucknell University, told ABC News. Still, even economists who downplayed the short-term impact of the court’s decision acknowledged significant implications for the years-long outlook of the economy. “The stakes are less the short-run effects tariffs would have and more the long-run effects. If this president or any president can make changes at the last minute, it undermines the possibility of having stable rules for trade and the organization of the world economy,” Vernengo said.",left
"Billy Edmonson voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 because of his stances on border security, gun rights and the economy. One year after casting his ballot, Edmonson is finding it difficult to make ends meet. “Everything’s already so expensive. ... That’s the worst thing about his presidency so far, is he promised things coming down and prices are not coming down. I make more money than I’ve ever made in my life right now, and it has, financially, been a struggle,” said Edmonson, a 35-year-old construction worker from Missouri. Edmonson recalled that Trump promised to start lowering prices on his first day in office. “It just doesn’t seem like there’s been a whole lot of focus on, ‘Hey, let’s get these prices down.’ It’s just been like, ‘Hey, prices are high because Biden did this.’ It’s like, well, Biden’s not in office anymore,” said Edmonson, a self-described independent, later adding, “It’s personally frustrating.” Edmonson is not alone. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of registered voters, including 30% of Republicans, said in the recent national NBC News poll that Trump has fallen short of their expectations on the cost of living and the economy. After being one of the big reasons why Trump won a return to the White House in 2024, Trump’s performance on the economy has become one of the big drags on his second term. While a number of Trump voters told NBC News in January that they’d give Trump a relatively long leash to improve the economy, the new interviews suggest that for some he’s running out of slack. “It just doesn’t seem like there’s been a whole lot of focus on, ‘Hey, let’s get these prices down.’ It’s just been like, ‘Hey, prices are high because Biden did this.’ It’s like, well, Biden’s not in office anymore.” Billy Edmonson Trump himself has cast doubt on surveys showing Americans are anxious about the economy, telling Fox News this week, “I think polls are fake. We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.” NBC News spoke to 18 Trump voters who participated in the most recent NBC News poll and said Trump had not met their expectations on the economy to explore how this group was thinking about Trump and experiencing the economy — and whether they were still committed to supporting his party. None regretted their vote for Trump last year, in many cases because of a deep frustration with Democrats. A handful said they’d be open to voting for Democrats in the future, though most planned to keep voting Republican. When it comes to the economy, many said the pain they’re feeling is real. “He and his advisers claim the country is going well, prices are going down, the tariffs are doing wonderfully,” Susan, a 66-year-old retiree from Nevada, said of Trump. (Several interviewees declined to share their last name when discussing politics, with some citing the nation’s polarized political atmosphere.) “But when you go to the store, the prices are up,” she added. Navigating high prices During and after his 2024 campaign, Trump not only promised to halt inflation but to bring prices lower after several years of post-Covid growth. That promise, made even though overall consumer prices essentially never decrease over time, cuts to the core of some of his voters’ complaints. “It’s always hard to bring down prices when somebody else has screwed something up like [President Joe Biden] did,” Trump said during a news conference in January, weeks before being sworn in. “We’re going to have prices down. I think you’re going to see some pretty drastic price reductions.” Jeremiah, a 48-year-old Republican from Utah who works in the aerospace industry, has voted for Trump each time he ran for president and backed him last year because he saw Trump as a change agent. But he said Trump’s handling of the economy so far has been “mediocre.” “I was definitely hoping to see a lot of prices come back down, like gas for your car, diesel, utilities, groceries. I was hoping to see it all come back down and level out at least, but it’s not. It just keeps getting worse,” Jeremiah said. “I have a 20-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter, and they can’t live on their own,” he later added. “My son’s a welder, and he makes $28 an hour, and he’s still not out on his own. Everything is just so overpriced. It’s ridiculous. When I graduated high school, I moved out and had a $300 a month apartment, piece of cake, 10 bucks an hour.” Edmonson, the Missouri construction worker, noted that he travels often for work. But motel and grocery prices have jumped, even for items like a can of soup, he said. And the high costs have him reconsidering his work on the road. “It’s almost getting to the point where it’s time for me to find something at home,” Edmonson said, later adding, “Because if I’m gonna sink, I might as well sink at home.” “I was surprised that the groceries haven’t went down. In fact, they keep going up.” Roxanne Novit Patty, a 70-year-old Republican retiree from Pennsylvania, blamed Trump for the country’s economic woes. Trump, she said, “has always been a very rich man. He’s never had to do anything his whole life. He’s never had to go shop. So, he has no idea what a true working person in their daily life has to do.” “I was surprised that the groceries haven’t went down. In fact, they keep going up. So that would be my biggest disappointment,” said Roxanne Novit, a 69-year-old retiree from Colorado and a self-described Republican. Susan, the Nevada retiree who is not registered with any party, said Trump’s handling of the economy “is not at all what I expected,” noting she was hopeful Trump would focus on “opening up mining and gasoline exploration.” “It seems like they’re moving a little slow on that because they’re spending all the time on the tariffs or making nice to the Chinese president or something like that,” Susan said. Giving him time But some voters were willing to give Trump some more time to turn things around, even among the subset who said they believe he’s fallen short. Overall, most Republicans still back Trump on the economy and other issues, according to the NBC News poll and other surveys. “I would like to see the economy turn up a little quicker, but everything takes time. You can’t expect it overnight,” said independent Robert Duran, 68, a retired law enforcement officer from Massachusetts. William Scheuer, a 68-year-old New Yorker, who said he voted for Trump in 2024 because he’s “old-fashioned” on things like social issues, agreed that Trump has been “falling a little short” on the economy, specifically noting prices. “Everything’s going up, it’s going up more than what the government is telling you,” he said, before adding he’s “confident [Trump] will” turn it around. “I would like to see the economy turn up a little quicker, but everything takes time. You can’t expect it overnight.” Robert Duran Craig Lovejoy, a 32-year-old Florida independent who works in pest control, said Trump is doing “better than many” presidents on addressing the economy. “I don’t think that one president will be all it takes to get things back on track, but I think we’re headed in the right direction,” Lovejoy said. Some voters were sympathetic to Trump’s tariff policies in particular, even as they were navigating higher prices. “The steak I used to buy that used to be like 40 bucks is now 80. I get it,” said Jason Olson, a 50-year-old small-business owner from South Carolina who typically backs Republicans. “And I know tariffs have raised prices on a lot of things as well. But I also understand the reason behind the tariffs are they want to bring industry back to the U.S.” Tim Fleming, a 42-year-old self-described libertarian who works in injection molding at a factory in Tennessee, agreed that Trump’s presidency has been “a little disappointing.” He raised frustrations about how Trump’s pledge not to tax overtime and tips was implemented as a tax deduction, so he and others won’t see the fruits of that until they file their taxes next year. “My overtime is still getting taxed; my bonuses are still getting taxed,” he said. “It was not what it was made out to be.” But he noted he believes he’s seen the direct fruits of Trump’s tariff push: the return of jobs in his county that had been offshored to Mexico. “The tariffs helped create a lot of jobs where I live,” Fleming said. Those comments come as the White House has tried to argue the administration is making important strides on affordability. “The president has done a lot that has already paid off in lower interest rates and lower inflation, but we inherited a disaster from Joe Biden and Rome wasn’t built in a day. We’re going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that’s the metric by which we’ll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X the day after Election Day. Down on Democrats While several Trump voters raised concerns about the economy and high prices, none of the voters, who are largely Republicans or independents, said they regretted their choice last year. “I wouldn’t change my vote, but I’m not happy,” said Elliot Muegge, a 32-year-old farmer from Oklahoma. Amanda, a 48-year-old postal worker from Missouri, said she still finds it difficult to make a budget because of high food prices. But, she said, she thinks former Vice President Kamala Harris “would have been worse.” “I wouldn’t change my vote, but I’m not happy.” Elliot Muegge A self-described conservative, Amanda said she would be open to supporting a Democratic candidate in a future election, but “not a progressive, more like an old-school Democrat.” A handful of Trump voters also said they would be open to supporting Democrats in the future, depending on the candidate. But others said backing a Democrat was off the table. “I think that they pander to friend groups and minorities and they look silly doing it. It’s fake,” Fleming, of Tennessee, said. “I haven’t found a single Democrat” that inspires trust, said Lovejoy, of Florida. Edmonson, the Missouri construction worker, said it could be years before he considers supporting a Democratic candidate, noting his strong support for gun rights. “They just don’t care about people in general. They want to say they care about people, but that — to me, all they want is, is votes,” Edmonson said, noting he is still frustrated with Trump. “I don’t feel like I can vote for a Democrat candidate,” Edmonson said. “I feel like I don’t have a candidate really.” Still, others who are open to backing Democrats warn that the economic angst coursing through the country — which Trump used to his advantage amid anger at the Biden administration in 2024 — could translate to political losses for Republicans. “Did he not promise the American people — Day 1 — that prices were going to go down? We are now in Month 11 and things continue to rise,” said Patty, the 70-year-old Pennsylvanian. While she said she regularly votes Republican, she’s split her ticket in the past, and she said she likes her state’s Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro. “The Republican Party is in for a rude awakening, and I think it’s not a bad thing,” she added. Muegge, from Oklahoma, shared a similar sentiment about the economy hurting Trump’s political standing. While he doesn’t blame Trump specifically for the cost of living, he expressed frustration about how he “unfairly manipulates the markets with his social media presence.” He pointed to a recent conversation he had with his father, also a Republican. “He and I were having a conversation, and he said, ‘I hate Trump.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, you do, too? I thought I was alone on this island,’” he said. “I don’t know if other people are saying that quietly behind their own closed doors and then pounding their chest in public,” he said. “I just don’t know.”",left
"Texas Gov. Abbott says he’ll ‘impose 100% tariff’ on New Yorkers who move in Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) wrote on the eve of Election Day that he would impose tariffs on any New Yorker who moves to Texas after voting ended. “After the polls close tomorrow night, I will impose a 100% tariff on anyone moving to Texas from NYC,” Abbott posted on social platform X. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for more information from NewsNation, The Hill’s sister network, on how those tariffs would work. The power to impose tariffs falls within the federal government’s authority in the Constitution, not the states. The race for New York City mayor has been closely watched nationally. President Trump endorsed independent candidate Andrew Cuomo on Truth Social. Trump’s endorsement read in part, “Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, [Zohran] Mamdani is not!” Mamdani is the front-runner in the mayoral race based on polling on Oct. 29 from Quinnipiac University. Polling suggested Mamdani had a lead with 43 percent, followed by Cuomo with 33 percent and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa with 14 percent. Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

"Households face unexpected rise in energy prices in new year - Published Millions of households will see a slight rise in energy prices in the depths of winter, after regulator Ofgem outlined its next price cap. The 0.2% increase from the current cap will take effect at the start of January, and affect those on variable tariffs in England, Wales and Scotland. The rise was a surprise after forecasters suggested the cap may fall at the start of the year. Government policy is primarily behind the shift. Gas and electricity bills remain relatively high, and the sudden drop in temperature has brought the costs to the forefront of people's minds. ""While wholesale energy costs are stabilising, they still make up the largest portion of our bills which leaves us open to volatile prices,"" said Tim Jarvis, from Ofgem. Rising electricity unit rates are behind the latest change, offset by a slight fall in gas rates. So, heavy users of electricity will see the biggest impact. Prices will be slightly lower than the same period the previous year, but Mr Jarvis said the cap was a backstop and people could take action - such as shopping around for a fixed tariff - to reduce their bill. Ofgem said the price cap change was driven by government policy costs and operating costs, such as funding the Sizewell C nuclear project which adds Â£1 a month to a typical bill. The cap sets the maximum price for each unit of gas and electricity, not the total bill - so those who use more energy, pay more. The Ofgem cap is illustrated with a household using a ""typical"" amount of 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. This household would see a Â£3 rise in its annual bill from Â£1,755 to Â£1,758. However, the amount used varies significantly between households, so the best way to calculate the change is to work out the percentage change from your own usual annual bill. Standing charges - the fixed costs that cover the cost of running the network as well as government levies - will rise by 2% for electricity and 3% for gas. Dame Clare Moriarty from Citizens Advice said: ""With bills still drastically higher than before the energy crisis, and due to rise again from April, it's high time for decisions about the longer term."" At St Nicholas Church in Maidstone, Kent, there is a community hub for parents and toddlers in one room, and a get together over tea and cake for the older generation in another. Liz Walker, one of the organisers of the morning cafe, said small changes had helped everyone with the cost of energy. ""We are into winter now and we open the doors earlier, as we have for the last three years, because it means some people won't have to put their heating on for the whole morning."" Debt worries Charities say they are seeing people owing increasing levels of unpaid bills and charges to suppliers. The total amount owed has reached a record Â£4.4bn, prompting plans from Ofgem to ensure energy companies write off some of that debt. Up to Â£500m could be knocked off the total under plans the regulator wants to take effect next year. Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said anyone facing difficulties paying should contact their energy provider as soon as possible. ""We know that far too many people are struggling to pay for the energy they need to use,"" she said. But she added suppliers could help with efficient appliances, more tailored tariffs or ensuring people were on the correct benefits. Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, which had expected the cap to fall, said Ofgem's announcement marked ""the beginning of a potential trend"" in which the main driver of higher bills would be government policies as opposed to higher wholesale energy prices. Principal consultant Dr Craig Lowrey said households faced bills rising further in April due to the costs of running the energy network and transitioning to net zero. But he added: ""A low carbon system means more energy security and less exposure to the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices."" The government has hinted at extra cost-of-living support in next week's Budget. One option said to be under consideration is removing VAT from energy bills, which would cut about Â£80 from annual bills. Dr Lowrey said any support would be ""zero-sum"" as ""these costs will still need to be recovered, whether through bills or through taxes, as the pipes, wires, and networks that keep the lights on still need investment as we move to a cleaner, more secure energy system"". Energy Minister Martin McCluskey said energy bills ""remain too high"", but that the government was taking action, with ""millions more families receiving Â£150 off their bills through the expanded Warm Home Discount scheme"". But the Conservatives said Labour's net zero policies were ""making energy unaffordable"". Shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho said: ""Ed Miliband promised to cut everyone's energy bills by Â£300 but more and more experts are sounding the alarm that his plans will lock us into paying higher bills for decades.""

"Brazil's Supreme Court has ruled that former president Jair Bolsonaro's coup conviction was final, with no more appeals allowed, clearing the way for him to begin serving a 27-year sentence. Bolsonaro, aged 70, was in September convicted over a scheme to stop leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after the 2022 elections, and that included an assassination plot. The Supreme Court rejected an appeal to his sentence earlier this month, and ruled the judgment was now final. The former army captain who fired up Brazil's conservatives to become president in 2019 and reshaped the country's politics will now have to serve the lengthy jail term. Bolsonaro had been under house arrest until Saturday, when he was detained at police headquarters in the capital Brasilia for tampering with his ankle monitor using a soldering iron. Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes said there had been ""very serious indications of a possible attempt to flee"" during a planned vigil organised by Bolsonaro's son outside his home. The justice pointed to the location of the nearby US embassy, and Bolsonaro's close relationship with US President Donald Trump, suggesting he may have tried to escape to seek political asylum. During a hearing on Sunday in Brasilia, Bolsonaro stated he ""experienced a certain paranoia between Friday and Saturday due to medication"", according to a Supreme Court document obtained by AFP. He also asserted ""that he had no intention of fleeing and that there was no breakage of the bracelet's strap"". In a video made public by the court on Saturday, Bolsonaro gave a different version of events: he said he had used a soldering iron on the monitoring bracelet out of ""curiosity"". Shortly before Bolsonaro tampered with the device, his lawyers had petitioned the court to allow him to serve out his sentence at home due to ill health.

"Guinness owner Diageo cut its sales and profit forecasts today, tipping its shares to a decade-low, as the world's top spirits maker left investors hanging on who its permanent CEO will be. Stubbornly low sales in the US and China, two crucial spirits markets where consumer confidence is low or their spending stretched, are punishing the maker of Johnnie Walker whisky and Smirnoff vodka along with its rivals. ""There's much more for us to do, and we need to go faster,"" said interim CEO Nik Jhangiani after Diageo's first quarter trading update, adding the performance was unsatisfactory. Diageo is attempting to cut costs and sell assets as the drinks industry faces cooling post-pandemic demand, tariff-related uncertainty and shifting consumer habits. Shares in Diageo slipped 5.3% to levels last seen in 2015, compounding an almost 30% fall so far this year. Jhangiani, who stepped in after the abrupt exit of former Diageo CEO Debra Crew in July, previously said he expected a decision on a permanent replacement by the end of October. But the company did not provide an update today. Cranley Macfarlane, deputy chief investment officer at Diageo investor Church House Investments, said this raised questions over why Jhangiani has not been confirmed in the CEO role on a permanent basis, as some had expected. Others said it also raised doubts over strategy. ""There is a plan in place which is going in the right direction, but whether a new CEO has a different view and a different strategy, no one will know until a permanent CEO is in place,"" said Richard Scrope, manager of the VT Tyndall Global Select Fund, which also holds Diageo stock. Diageo said it now expects 2026 sales to be flat or slightly lower with only low to mid single-digit operating profit growth. It had earlier forecast annual sales performance similar to last year, when sales grew 1.7%, along with mid single-digit operating profit growth in 2026. The decision to revise the outlook came despite a better-than-expected, albeit flat, first-quarter sales performance. Diageo flagged a double-digit decline in sales in China, driven by a drop in consumption of national spirit baijiu. Meanwhile, in the US, its sales fell 4.1% with a steep drop in tequilas such as Don Julio, which has been a critical growth engine for Diageo.",centre
"European companies that make products from copper have warned they are facing critical shortages unless the EU takes action to curb exports of scrap, as it has for aluminium. Large amounts of refined copper have been shipped to the US by investors attracted by higher prices there based on tariff expectations. At the same time, exports of copper scrap from the EU have surged by 31% since 2022, with about half going to China, according to a position paper issued by companies accounting for more than 90% of European copper scrap usage. ""What makes me nervous is there's a high risk of a cathode shortage in Europe next year,"" said Uwe Schmidt, an executive at German metal products producer Wieland. ""Scrap shortage and cathode shortage will be a dangerous mixture for the semi-fabricators,"" he said. Cathodes are slabs of refined copper and fabricators use copper to produce a variety of semi-finished products such as wire, tubes and rods. The European Commission earlier this week announced plans to restrict EU exports of scrap aluminium to stop the metal flooding out of the bloc. It would be logical for the EU to do the same for the copper industry, Schmidt said. The companies named in the industry paper also included Aurubis, ElvalHalcor and La Farga.",centre
"The United States and Britain have announced a deal to secure zero tariffs on British pharmaceutical products and medical technology in return for Britain spending more on medicines and overhauling how it values drugs. Under the agreement, Britain will raise the net price it pays for new US medicines by 25%. In return, UK-made medicines, drug ingredients and medical technology will be exempt from Section 232 sectoral tariffs and any future Section 301 country tariffs. ""The United States and the United Kingdom announce this negotiated outcome pricing for innovative pharmaceuticals, which will help drive investment and innovation in both countries,"" United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement. The agreement means Britain will be exempted from hefty US tariffs imposed on pharma imports that went into effect on 1 October. The deal includes a significant change to the value appraisal framework at NICE, which is the UK body that determines whether new drugs are cost-effective for the NHS. NICE's ""quality-adjusted life year"" threshold, currently £30,000 per year, will rise to £35,000. The British government said the change to NICE would let it ""keep pace with the commercial and economic environment in which pharmaceutical companies are operating in today."" The revised framework will apply to all new medicines, not just US drugs, but will not affect prices of existing treatments. NICE has often rejected coverage of new, expensive drugs through the NHS, for example Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's drug and AstraZeneca's breast cancer treatment Enhertu. British pharmaceutical industry group ABPI said the deal would help British patients access new medicines and help attract investment from drugmakers. Shares in UK-based drugmakers GSK and AstraZeneca were broadly unchanged on the agreement. The UK is a very small market for the pharmaceutical industry, making up just 2% of AstraZeneca's total revenue for instance. GSK welcomed the deal, saying ""these good foundations, offer a real opportunity to secure the UK as an attractive global-leading environment for life sciences that rewards long-term innovation."" US President Donald Trump has pressed Britain and the rest of Europe to pay more for American medicines, part of his push for US medicine costs to be brought more in line with those paid in other wealthy nations. The industry has criticised a tough operating environment in Britain and some major firms have cancelled or paused investment in Britain, including AstraZeneca, the largest firm on the London Stock Exchange by market value. One point of contention between the sector and the government has been the operation of a voluntary pricing scheme which sees firms put a proportion of sales to the NHS back into the health service. The office of the USTR said Britain had committed that the rebate rate would decrease to 15% in 2026. The breakthrough comes after the two countries agreed in May to seek ""significantly preferential treatment outcomes on pharmaceuticals"", with a commitment that Britain tries to improve the environment for pharma firms operating in the country. It concludes talks on a major unresolved issue after Britain became the first country to secure tariff relief on some other sectors in May. The European Union and US agreed a trade deal in July that capped tariffs on exports on pharmaceuticals, and most other goods, from the EU at 15%.",centre
"European leaders flocked to Angola this week to strike deals and deepen cooperation with their African counterparts, as global tensions mount. ""Africa and Europe are partners of choice, bound by common interests and priorities and shared values,"" EU Council President António Costa posted on social media before the EU-African Union (AU) Summit kicked off on Monday. ""In a turbulent world, our commitment to build a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable future - and to defend multilateralism - must guide our actions,"" he wrote. Of course, Africa and Europe were not always partners of choice. For much of modern history, European nations conquered and plundered the continent, seizing its abundant natural resources for their own enrichment. As delegates gathered in the capital, Luanda, the country had just celebrated 50 years since gaining independence from Portugal. For the previous 400 years, Portugal had ruled over the oil and diamond-rich nation, which by the 19th Century, was the largest source of slaves for the Americas. A brutal 40-year civil war followed independence and today, Angola remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. Landmine victims can be seen on the streets of the capital. Despite the country’s enormous wealth, little of it appears to trickle down. ""We earn less than a hundred US dollars a month,"" one Luanda tour operator told RTÉ News. Asked can you live on that here, he answered: ""We don’t live, we survive"". He was hopeful about the Europeans being in town. ""There needs to be more investment here,"" he said, ""instead of the money going overseas"". Today, Africa’s natural resources are once again very much in demand. The continent is home to more than half of the world’s cobalt reserves - essential for rechargeable batteries, wind turbines and even some nuclear weapons. There are also vast reserves of copper, lithium and manganese. And then there are Africa's human resources. As populations in Europe and Asia tip into decline, Africa’s is set to grow. It will be home to a quarter of the world’s people in 2050 and top four billion by century’s end. ""I think the potential, if you look two to three decades ahead, is Africa,"" Taoiseach Micheál Martin said as the AU-EU Summit began, ""in terms of population growth, in terms of the importance of what will be a significant economic market in time"". The European Union is still the biggest market for African countries, he said. ""So, it is very important to have a structured, sustainable, respectful and mutually beneficial relationship with Africa,"" he added. Europe, still reeling from the US trade tariffs and China’s export control on critical minerals, wants to shore up its supply chain resilience. ""I believe there has been less progress than the EU hoped for,"" Adrian Joseph from the South African Institute of International Affairs said. While European and African nations have struck deals on critical minerals - the most recent on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Johannesburg last week - the roadmaps that accompany them are not publicly available, he said. ""This makes is difficult to assess progress,"" he said, adding ""a lack of transparency around these agreements is naturally not only an implementation problem, but also an accountability issue"". For Africa, there remains a risk of exploitation, Mr Joseph said. ""In the absence of any serious reforms, there is a real risk that the extraction of the critical minerals needed to power the energy transition could occur at the expense of citizens and the environment in African countries,"" he added. However, African leaders were clear in their demands. In return for supplying Europe with critical minerals, they want the EU to open up its market. In his address to the summit, Chairperson of the AU Commission Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said: ""We are calling for more balanced trade partnerships. ""I’m pleading for European investments in the transformation process of our minerals on the continent. ""I’m calling for the lifting of any tariff hampering the access of African products to the European market."" Of course, in eyeing up Africa’s natural wealth, Europe is not alone. ""There are other interests involved in Africa,"" Mr Martin told reporters, ""including Russia and China"". Indeed, China has been investing heavily in the continent for decades. More than 50 African countries signed up to China's leader Xi Jinping’s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure development project. Luanda’s gleaming new international airport, for example, is Chinese-built. Now with so much interest flowing from wealthy nations, African governments could be in a position to choose the best deals, analysts said. ""It is about which partners can provide the best value proposition to African countries seeking investments in their mining sectors, as these countries are not eager to become entangled in the geopolitical tensions between the US and China,"" Mr Joseph said.",centre
"The European Commission has recalled consignments of frozen Brazilian beef products imported into the EU, after it was found they contained hormones banned in the bloc. The banned hormones were detected in shipments that arrived into Europe earlier this month. Authorities in a number of countries have removed affected products from sale, and issued recalls where necessary. EU countries impacted by the situation include Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Slovakia. The United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) is also among the countries affected. The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) has said the recalls of Brazilian beef raise questions about controls in Brazil. IFA President Francie Gorman said they ""raise very significant concerns around the lack of robust controls in slaughterhouses in Brazil, which has allowed hormone beef to enter the EU and be sold to European citizens"". He added the findings ""have to be a serious wake-up call for the bureaucrats and cheerleaders attempting to usher through a Mercosur trade deal for the benefit of big industry at the expense of European farmers and the health and wellbeing of EU citizens"". It comes after a recent investigation from the Irish Farmers Journal, which claimed to have been able to buy animal antibiotics in Brazil without prescriptions, and hormones banned in the EU. The European Commission is pushing for the ratification of Mercosur, which would create the world's biggest free-trade zone and significantly increase EU exports to Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Mercosur countries would be able to export up to 99,000 tonnes of beef into the EU at a much-reduced tariff rate of 7.5%, as well as 180,000 tonnes of poultry. Several EU member states, notably Ireland and France, are opposed to its ratification, citing the potential to massively distort key agricultural markets.",centre
"UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell has said all populations and all economies need to get results from the COP30 climate talks, but added time is running out. He was speaking as the climate negotiations in Belém, Brazil, have reached the halfway mark. Mr Stiell hinted at impasses over critical issues such as providing climate finance and transitioning away from fossil fuels, and urged the negotiators to push further to find compromises. With government ministers, including Ireland's Minister for Climate Daragh O'Brien, arriving in Belém before Monday, the focus is about to shift from technical drafting of proposed agreements and declarations to tricky high-stakes diplomacy and decision-making. Energy, finance, climate adaptation and climate ambition will be the key battlegrounds. Mr Stiell has hinted strongly about log jams and stalled progress on key issues which could include climate finance, transparency, ambition, and matters that impact on international trade. He appealed last night to the negotiators to make it as easy as possible for governments to compromise by pushing themselves further and sticking to the painstaking yet crucial work behind the scenes. Mr Stiell said certain climate issue that are not a priority for some countries are clearly issues and priorities for others. He added that the negotiating process must deliver strong results. That requires listening to and understanding the issues that matter most to other nations and groups, he said. He told the negotiators from 194 countries, plus the EU, that if they do not align and find common ground on issues important to others, then COP30 will not deliver outcomes that show the Paris Climate Agreement is working. He asked them to seek out and find each other in hallways to iron out their difficulties. ""It is not clear if every national negotiating team is prepared to be at the table discussing the critical issues, but the negotiations need to get past this point quickly,"" he said. Mr Stiell said that the prospect of a hotter, poorer and less healthy world, along with the human and economic losses caused by climate change, strongly underscores just how important it is for COP30 to achieve a good outcome. Earlier, the Executive Secretary had appealed to the parties negotiating to make progress in relation to the provision of climate finance for poorer countries. Mr Stiell said such assistance is the life blood of climate action. ""It is what turns climate plans into progress and climate ambition into implementation. He reiterated that providing climate finance is not an act of charity by rich nations. Rather, he said, it is smart economics, because climate action, underpinned by climate finance, is the growth story of the 21st century. When climate finance is made available, ambition grows. It enables climate plans to be implemented, which creates jobs, reduces the cost of living, improves health, protects communities, and secures a prosperous and more resilient planet for all. Prominent Climate Scientist Katherine Hayhoe, who is the Chief Scientist at The Nature Conservancy, and speaker on behalf of Nature4Climate, a global coalition of environmental organisations, said COP30 has lived up to its promise of being an implementation cop during its first week. She said she was pleased to hear indigenous voices at the negotiating table, and to see the role of nature take centre stage in climate solutions. Ms Hayhoe was referring to initiatives such as the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, launched by the Brazilian COP30 Presidency in the first few days. She described this facility as a potential game-changer for curbing deforestation. It aims to raise €125 billion per year to reward countries for preserving rainforests like the Amazon. The idea is to ensure a hectare of rainforest will always be worth more than a hectare of land cleared for farming. This will ensure that any incentive to cut down the trees is removed. Two days after it was announced, the Tropical Forest Forever Facility had attracted commitments of $5.5 billion in funding from Norway, Brazil, France, Germany, China and others. Ireland did not invest. Taoiseach Micheál Martin described it as ""interesting"" and said his Government will assess it. Week one of COP30 has seen unprecedented attention paid to climate misinformation and efforts to ensure people have accurate and factual information for responsible decisions. However, there is no guarantee that week two will run as smoothly. The outcome depends critically on how ministers and negotiators tackle the continued global reliance on fossil fuels. Melissa, a Category 5 hurricane, tore through the Caribbean, severely impacting Jamaica just three days before the COP30 leaders' summit. The Philippines was also hit by its second major typhoon in a single week. Heat waves, floods, wildfires and droughts are becoming more severe and putting more people at risk every single year. Ms Hayhoe said a strong outcome to the Belém climate talks would send a powerful signal of solidarity and hope to the communities on the front lines of climate change. Every line in the draft COP30 text represents lives, livelihoods and ecosystems. There are some very tricky issues for government ministers to deal with in week two the negotiations. The obligation of developed countries to provide finance for poorer countries is certainly one. Another concerns issues around trade and the potential consequences of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism for international trade rules. Such a mechanism could also significantly disadvantage already vulnerable poorer nations trying to export into bigger markets. For them, a carbon border price adjustment imposed on their products might be akin to a tariff. There is also the issue of transparency and building trust, within and between countries about climate measures and climate actions that we are told are being implemented. It is one thing for a country to give certain commitments in response to international climate targets. It is quite another for them to live up to those promises, commitment and turn them into action. This focus on transparency issues over the coming week will shift the international climate policy focus from simply registering and recording national climate pledges to a focus on monitoring and policing the implementation of climate commitments. This is a fundamental shift. It is key to ensuring that COP30 is truly an implementation COP as has been promised by Brazil's President Lula.",centre
"World champions South Africa beat Ireland 24-13 at the Aviva Stadium to claim their first win in Dublin since 2012. Andy Farrell's side had four players sent to the sin-bin and James Ryan was red-carded. Here's how we rated the players on a tough night for the hosts. 15. Mack Hansen – 7 Battled hard but didn't get a decent share of the high balls, succumbed to injury late on. Made a good run early on that came to nothing. Carried six times for over 20 metres, looks at home at full-back. 14. Tommy O’Brien - 6 Hustled hard and was hit hard by the ravenous Springboks. The tackle from Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu that was deemed just a penalty should have had a higher tariff. Failed his head injury assessment before half-time after giving away a penalty. 13. Garry Ringrose – 7 Met fire with fire in the midfield but was starved of much in the way of quality ball. Carried 10 times for some hard yards, missed a couple of tackles but not alone. 12. Bundee Aki – 6 Ireland needed more of an impact from their most physical back, who made over nine metres off seven carries. However, has to be noted that he had to pack down on the side of the scrum for most of the game. 11. James Lowe – 7 Ireland’s top carrier with 12. The winger broke free a couple of times and drew multiple defenders otherwise. Was first on the scene before Tadhg Beirne’s disallowed try. Got blocked down as Ireland chased late on and had Jack Crowley to thank for preventing a try. 10. Sam Prendergast – 6.5 A mixed game for the out-half and he paid the price for a series of offside penalties at the end of the first half. Missed a kickable penalty that indirectly led to James Ryan’s red card but landed a more difficult one in the second half. Missed just one of 12 tackle attempts. 9. Jamison Gibson-Park – 7 Didn’t get much to work with due to the scrum issues. Did very well to clear his lines under pressure a couple of times. Won’t be happy with his tackle for South Africa’s only try of the second half. Beautiful assist pass for Ireland’s try. 1. Andrew Porter – 5.5 Understandable as it was, the Irish scrum was demolished. Porter gave away four penalties and was sent to the bin. Made a couple of big carries early on and 11 tackles. 2. Dan Sheehan – 6.5 Took his try very well, powering over from close range. However, Ireland’s lineout was again an issue, admittedly under pressure. 3. Tadhg Furlong – 6 Not a day for the Irish front row and Furlong missed three tackles as well. Battled away but the 'bread and butter’ as Andy Farrell might say, wasn’t covered. 4. James Ryan – 4 Started with intent and won a turnover. Can’t have any real complaints about his red card, which was upgraded from yellow after a bunker review. Ireland needed him for more than 20 minutes. 5. Tadhg Beirne – 6 Beirne was quite by his own standards as Ireland were largely in fire-fighting mode. Racked up nine tackles and had a turnover to his name but also conceded two penalties. 6. Ryan Baird – 7 One of Ireland’s better performers. Made a big tackle, one of nine, on Jasper Wiese that resulted in a turnover close to the line. Limped off near the end after another big shift. Took three lineouts. 7. Josh van der Flier – 7 Started off like a man with a point to prove and left everything out there. Must have been hard to know if he was coming or going with the amount of enforced switches Ireland had to make. Made 12 tackles. 8. Caelan Doris – 7.5 The captain was Ireland’s top tackler with 14. Constantly put himself in harm’s way and did his best to put Ireland on the front foot. Made nine carries but the stats show he conceded three turnovers. Great to have him back after a lengthy layoff before November. Replacements. 16. Rónan Kelleher (for Sheehan 56) – 6 Made a nice hit on Leinster team-mate RG Snyman. 17. Paddy McCarthy (for Van der Flier, 40-49, and for Porter, 60-70) – 7.5 Made a immediate impact after coming on, credited with two turnovers. Big find for Ireland in this window. Was yellow carded but who wasn’t? 18. Finlay Bealham (for Furlong 60) – 6 Made himself available to carry plenty of ball. 19. Cian Prendergast (for Ryan (red card) 39 ) – 7.5 Took four lineouts and busied himself when called earlier than expected. Knock on led to South Africa's fourth try but otherwise did very well. 20. Jack Conan (for Baird 60) – 6.5 Tried hard to make an impact. 21. Craig Casey (for Ringrose 72) – 6 Did his best to get something going. 22. Jack Crowley (for O’Brien 32 HIA) – 5.5 Saved a couple of tries with scramble defence but yellow carded for an effort that he was never going to get away with. 23. Tom Farrell (for Hansen 64) – 6 Made two tackles, missed one after replacing Hansen.",centre

"This year is on track to be the second or third warmest globally as an ""unprecedented streak"" of high temperatures continues, UN scientists have warned. Global average surface temperatures in January to August 2025 were 1.42C above pre-industrial levels, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said, a slight drop from the record highs of 1.55C in 2024. As world leaders gather in Belém, Brazil, for the latest round of UN climate talks, the WMO said it was ""virtually impossible"" to curb global warming to the agreed limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in the next few years without temporarily overshooting the target. But it is ""still entirely possible and essential"" to bring temperatures down to the 1.5C goal by the end of the century, WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo said. Watch: More leaders need to 'tell it as it is' om climate, Taoiseach tells COP30 The latest UN talks come in the wake of a year in which people around the world have been battered by climate and weather extremes from damaging rainfall and floods to severe heat and wildfire - but as politicians in a number of countries seek to row back on action to combat the worsening situation. This year has been slightly cooler than last year as the El Niño climate phenomenon in the tropical Pacific, which boosted global temperatures in 2023 and 2024, shifted to neutral conditions at the start of 2025. The El Niño/La Niña pattern influences the global climate in addition to the warming caused by humans burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests, which put heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, pushing up temperatures and sea levels and causing more extreme weather. The WMO's analysis finds that the past 11 years - from 2015, when countries signed up to the Paris Agreement to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C to avoid its worst impacts, to 2025 - are individually the 11 warmest on record. The past three years have been the three warmest years in the record stretching back 176 years, the WMO said. The UN's meteorological agency also warned that concentrations of greenhouse gases, which reached record levels in 2024, continued to rise in 2025. Ms Saulo said: ""This unprecedented streak of high temperatures, combined with last year's record increase in greenhouse gas levels, makes it clear that it will be virtually impossible to limit global warming to 1.5C in the next few years without temporarily overshooting this target. ""But the science is equally clear that it's still entirely possible and essential to bring temperatures back down to 1.5C by the end of the century."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned: ""Each year above 1.5C will hammer economies, deepen inequalities and inflict irreversible damage. ""We must act now, at great speed and scale, to make the overshoot as small, as short, and as safe as possible - and bring temperatures back below 1.5C before the end of the century."" He said it could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions of people to un-livable conditions, and amplify threats to peace and security. ""Every fraction of a degree means more hunger, displacement, and loss – especially for those least responsible. This is moral failure – and deadly negligence,"" he said. Watch: Guterres says political courage is needed to transition to clean energy He said the United Nations will not give up on the 1.5 degrees goal and that we have never been better equipped to fight back. He spoke about the clean energy revolution with solar and wind, now the cheapest sources of power, and the fastest growing sources of electricity in history. In 2024, investors poured 2 trillion US dollars into clean energy – 800 billion more than fossil fuels. ""Clean energy is winning on price, performance, and potential – offering the solutions to transform our economies and protect our populations. What's still missing is political courage"", he said. ""Fossil fuels still command vast subsidies – taxpayers’ money. Too many corporations are making record profits from climate devastation – with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress. Too many leaders remain captive to these entrenched interests. Too many countries are starved of the resources to adapt – and locked out of the clean energy transition,"" he added. In an update to its annual state of the climate report timed to coincide with the start of the UN Cop30 talks in Brazil, the WMO highlighted that ocean heat continued to rise in 2025 above the record levels seen in 2024, with impacts including damage to natural systems, intensifying storms, accelerating sea ice loss and sea level rises. Long term rates of sea level rise have doubled, and 2024 set a new record for annual global average sea levels, though it has dropped slightly since 2025 in what the experts said is likely temporary behaviour. The WMO highlighted too that Arctic sea ice was at its lowest levels on record for the time of year after the winter freeze, while Antarctic sea ice was the third lowest on record for its annual minimum and maximum extents. Concentrations of three key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, were at record highs in 2024 and measurements from individual locations suggest they will be even higher in 2025. In response to the report, Gareth Redmond-King, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think tank said: ""Nations are gathering for the start of the COP30 climate summit at the end of a year that has seen devastating hurricanes, wildfires and flooding across the world; here at home, we've seen the second worst harvest as a result of climate change."" He said that news that 2025 was set to be the second or third hottest on record, alongside warnings that current pledges of climate action still put the world on track for dangerous levels of temperature rise ""should focus leaders' minds"". ""Net zero emissions is the only solution we have to halt climate change, to limit the worsening danger and rising costs which this represents, and bring the climate system back into balance."" Lula warns world leaders of 'extremist forces' lying about climate President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of COP30 host Brazil said that ""extremist forces"" were condemning future generations to life on a planet forever altered by global warming. Mr Lula lashed out at ""extremist forces (that) fabricate fake news ... to obtain electoral gains and imprison future generations,"" as he warned that the window to prevent calamitous climate change was ""closing rapidly"". Mr Lula pointed to a recent UN report that found Earth will likely be 2.5C warmer by 2100 from pre-industrial levels. This would claim an estimated 250,000 lives per year and shrink global GDP by almost a third, he told dozens of leaders gathered in Belem.

"China's exports fell in October for the first time in eight months, official data showed today, as trade tensions flared in the weeks before Chinese President Xi Jinping met US counterpart Donald Trump. Shipments dropped 1.1% year on year, missing a Bloomberg forecast of a 2.9% rise. Imports in the same month rose 1%, China's General Administration of Customs said. That was also well off September's reading and short of the 2.7% climb estimated in the Bloomberg forecast. China and the US reached a detente in their trade war after Xi and Trump met in South Korea at the end of October. That put a precarious pause on months of tit-for-tat measures between the economic and technological powerhouses as the leaders agreed to suspend a raft of measures for a year. Beijing last month announced fresh restrictions on exports of rare earth technologies, a sector it dominates and is critical to defence and auto manufacturers. Trump retaliated by threatening an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods. However, that warning was called off after Xi and Trump met last month in South Korea, with the US leader calling their first encounter since 2019 a ""great success"". Washington halved a blanket tariff on Chinese goods to 10%, while Beijing loosened restrictions on rare earth exports of rare earths, also providing relief to European businesses. China also lifted extra tariffs on US agricultural products including soybeans, critical to American farmers who are a key part of Trump's base. China's imports from the United States fell 11.6% month-on-month in October, the customs data showed, while its shipments in the other direction rose 1.8%. Chinese exporters had been ""frontloading their trade in order to avoid high tariffs in the US"", Zhiwei Zhang, economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note. The country's shipments to the US jumped by 8.6% in September from August after falling by 11.8% from July. ""It seems the frontloading finally faded in October. As the trade war is put on hold for one year, exports will likely normalise,"" Zhang said. ""Now that export momentum weakens, China needs to rely more on domestic demand,"" he warned",centre
"South Korean car giant Hyundai Motor Group has pledged today an unprecedented $85.8 billion investment in the country over the next five years, a move that comes on the heels of Seoul's trade deal with Washington. Hyundai called it ""the company's largest-ever domestic investment commitment"". ""A significant portion of the investment will focus on new businesses based on advanced AI technologies, such as robotics, contributing to the development of Korea's AI and Robotics innovation ecosystem,"" the company said in a press release. The roadmap ""highlights the Group's agility in actively responding to the rapidly changing global business environment"", it added. Around 40% of the total spending will go into developing ""AI, software defined vehicles (SDVs), electrification, robotics, and hydrogen"", the company said. It added that the investment would help boost exports of South Korea-made vehicles by 13% to 2.47 million units by 2030. The announcement follows a similar pledge by Samsung Group, another major conglomerate whose flagship firm is Samsung Electronics, which vowed to invest $310 billion over the same time, largely in artificial intelligence technologies. Samsung Electronics is already one of the world's top memory-chip makers, providing crucial components for the AI industry and the infrastructure it relies on. Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Kia, sold more than 7.2 million vehicles last year in South Korea and overseas combined. The investment commitments follow Seoul's conclusion of a new trade deal with Washington, under which South Korean exports, including Hyundai vehicles, will face a reduced tariff rate of 15%, down from 25%. But the new rate still remains significantly higher than the previous 2.5% applied under an existing free trade pact.",centre
"US presses Europe on rules for big tech companies - Published Europe should ""reconsider"" its rules for big tech companies if it wants to see lower US tariff rates on its steel and aluminium exports, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said. His comments come as officials from the US and European Union are meeting in Brussels to discuss the status of the trade framework that the two sides agreed in July. That deal set US tariff rates on European products at 15%, lower than had been threatened, in exchange for promises of European investment and changes that would allow in more American agricultural products. But the two sides remain at odds over some parts of the deal. European officials hoped they would secure relief for their metals exports as part of the deal reached over the summer, but the US is still charging at 50% duty - and has expanded the number of products subject to the levy. Europe is also hoping to win carve-outs from tariffs for items such as wine, cheese and pasta, similar to the rollback the Trump administration recently granted for tropical fruit and coffee. In an update to reporters on the talks, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the US wanted to see Europe follow through on promises to lower tariffs on American goods before it would grant exemptions. He and Mr Lutnick said the US wanted to see concessions over European rules for tech companies in exchange for changes to metals tariffs. ""They would like to have steel and aluminium as part of this package and we think it is very, very important that they understand our digital companies and they reconsider their digital regulations to be more inviting to our big companies,"" Mr Lutnick said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. The US has long maintained that taxes on digital services - which typically charge levies on revenue from streaming or digital advertising companies above a certain size - unfairly target American firms. US firms have also been unhappy with Europe's Digital Markets Act, which came into force last year. It was aimed at boosting competition, for example setting rules that would require a company like Apple to make its iPhones work with devices such as headphones made by other brands. When Trump was re-elected last year, many tech firms hoped he would champion a fight over the rules and taxes, unlike the Biden administration, which was seen as leaving such battles up to the firms involved. European officials have previously said that its digital rules were not up for negotiation. European Trade Commissioner MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU had maintained that stance when the issue arose on Monday. ""This is not discriminatory. It is not aimed at American companies,"" he added.",centre
"Sony has today raised its operating profit forecast for the year ending March 2026 by 8% to 1.43 trillion yen ($9.5 billion), citing a smaller-than-expected impact from US tariffs and the strength of its entertainment and chips businesses. Operating profit in the July-September quarter climbed 10% to 429 billion yen after its music unit, which includes anime, and chips businesses recorded higher sales. Sony cited the success of animated movie ""Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle"" as a contributor. The Japanese conglomerate was once best known for household electronics but has become an entertainment powerhouse and is banking on the growth of anime. Profit at Sony's games business fell in the second quarter as the company booked impairment losses related to the ""Destiny 2"" video game. User engagement has not met the expectations Sony had when it bought Bungie, a studio, Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao said at a briefing. Sony sold 3.9 million units of its PlayStation 5, which launched in 2020, during the quarter in a slight increase from the same time a year earlier. ""We plan to expand the install base during the year-end sales season while continuing to balance that expansion with the profitability of the entire segment,"" Tao said. Take-Two Interactive said last week it has delayed the release of ""Grand Theft Auto VI"" for a second time to November next year. The highly anticipated title is expected to boost Sony's PlayStation business as customers upgrade their consoles or buy specialised gaming hardware for the first time. Sony said it has sold 3.3 million units of ""Ghost of Yotei"", which launched last month and has been well received. Nintendo last week hiked its annual sales forecast for the Switch 2 to 19 million units as consumers flock to the gaming device which launched in June. Sony, a leading manufacturer of image sensors used in smartphones, cited sales of larger sensors as boosting its chips unit during the quarter. Customers may have brought forward purchases due to tariffs and other factors, Sony said. Sony said it sees a 50 billion yen hit from tariffs during the financial year, compared to the 70 billion yen impact estimate in August. The company said it would buy back up to 35 million shares for some 100 billion yen. Sony's shares closed up 5.5% following the earnings release.",centre
"This year is on track to be the second or third warmest globally as an ""unprecedented streak"" of high temperatures continues, UN scientists have warned. Global average surface temperatures in January to August 2025 were 1.42C above pre-industrial levels, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said, a slight drop from the record highs of 1.55C in 2024. As world leaders gather in Belém, Brazil, for the latest round of UN climate talks, the WMO said it was ""virtually impossible"" to curb global warming to the agreed limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in the next few years without temporarily overshooting the target. But it is ""still entirely possible and essential"" to bring temperatures down to the 1.5C goal by the end of the century, WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo said. Watch: More leaders need to 'tell it as it is' om climate, Taoiseach tells COP30 The latest UN talks come in the wake of a year in which people around the world have been battered by climate and weather extremes from damaging rainfall and floods to severe heat and wildfire - but as politicians in a number of countries seek to row back on action to combat the worsening situation. This year has been slightly cooler than last year as the El Niño climate phenomenon in the tropical Pacific, which boosted global temperatures in 2023 and 2024, shifted to neutral conditions at the start of 2025. The El Niño/La Niña pattern influences the global climate in addition to the warming caused by humans burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests, which put heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, pushing up temperatures and sea levels and causing more extreme weather. The WMO's analysis finds that the past 11 years - from 2015, when countries signed up to the Paris Agreement to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C to avoid its worst impacts, to 2025 - are individually the 11 warmest on record. The past three years have been the three warmest years in the record stretching back 176 years, the WMO said. The UN's meteorological agency also warned that concentrations of greenhouse gases, which reached record levels in 2024, continued to rise in 2025. Ms Saulo said: ""This unprecedented streak of high temperatures, combined with last year's record increase in greenhouse gas levels, makes it clear that it will be virtually impossible to limit global warming to 1.5C in the next few years without temporarily overshooting this target. ""But the science is equally clear that it's still entirely possible and essential to bring temperatures back down to 1.5C by the end of the century."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned: ""Each year above 1.5C will hammer economies, deepen inequalities and inflict irreversible damage.

"US Supreme Court justices has raised doubts over the legality of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs in a case with implications for the global economy that marks a major test of Mr Trump's powers. Both conservative and liberal justices sharply questioned the lawyer representing Mr Trump's administration about whether the president had intruded on the power of Congress in imposing tariffs under a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. But some of the conservative justices also signaled that they were wrestling with their recognition of the inherent power that presidents have in dealing with foreign countries, suggesting the court could be sharply divided in the outcome of the case. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority. During arguments lasting more than two-and-a-half hours, the justices asked US Solicitor General D. John Sauer whether Mr Trump's application of this statute to impose tariffs of unlimited duration was a major action by the executive branch that would require clear congressional authorisation. Those questions related to the Supreme Court's ""major questions"" doctrine, which requires executive branch actions of vast economic and political significance to be clearly authorised by US lawmakers. The arguments came in appeals pursued by the administration after lower courts ruled that his unprecedented use of the law at issue to impose the tariffs exceeded his authority. Businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 US states, most of them Democratic-led, challenged the tariffs. The tariffs - taxes on imported goods - could add up to trillions of dollars for the United States over the next decade. Mr Trump has heaped pressure on the Supreme Court to preserve tariffs that he has leveraged as a key economic and foreign policy tool. Some of the conservative justices also asked pointed questions to the two lawyers arguing against the tariffs. Neal Katyal, representing businesses, and Benjamin Gutman, representing Oregon, one of the states involved in the case. Mr Sauer kicked off the arguments by defending the legal rationale employed by the president but immediately faced questions raising skepticism over the administration's arguments about the language and purpose of the statute at issue. Mr Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose the tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. The law allows a president to regulate commerce in a national emergency. 'Ruthless trade retaliation' Mr Sauer said Mr Trump determined that US trade deficits have brought the nation to the brink of an economic and national security catastrophe. Mr Sauer said imposition of the tariffs has helped Mr Trump negotiate trade deals, and unwinding those agreements ""would expose us to ruthless trade retaliation by far more aggressive countries and drive America from strength to failure with ruinous economic and national security consequences"". The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs. The administration has argued that IEEPA allows tariffs by authorising the president to ""regulate"" imports to address emergencies. The imposition of taxes on Americans ""has always been the core power of Congress,"" conservative Chief Justice John Roberts told Mr Sauer, adding that these tariffs seem to be raising revenue, which the Constitution contemplates as a role for Congress. Mr Trump invoked IEEPA in slapping tariffs on goods imported from individual countries to address what he called a national emergency related to US trade deficits, as well as in February as economic leverage on China, Canada and Mexico to curb the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned Mr Sauer about his argument that IEEPA's language granting presidents emergency power to ""regulate importation"" encompasses tariffs. ""Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase together 'regulate importation' has been used to confer tariff imposing authority?"" Ms Barrett asked. Mr Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, one of the many ways he has aggressively pushed the boundaries of executive authority since he returned to office in areas as varied as his crackdown on immigration, the firing of federal agency officials and domestic military deployments. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the lead-up to the arguments that if the Supreme Court rules against Mr Trump's use of IEEPA, his tariffs are expected to remain in place because the administration would switch to other legal authorities to underpin them. In fact, conservative Justice Samuel Alito asked about a different statute that has gotten less attention, known as Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, could provide an alternate basis for Mr Trump's tariffs. He has imposed some additional tariffs invoking other laws. Those are not at issue in this case. Mr Trump instigated a global trade war when he returned to the presidency in January, alienating trading partners, increasing volatility in financial markets and fueling global economic uncertainty. Mr Trump has wielded tariffs to extract concessions and renegotiate trade deals, and as a cudgel to punish countries that draw his ire on non-trade political matters.",centre
"British bootmaker Dr Martens said today its drive to scale back discounts in the US and shift production from China would help to offset the impact of trade tariffs in the coming years. The company, known for its chunky lace-up boots, has been pulling back on discounts and expanding into shoes, sandals, and bags under CEO Ije Nwokorie as it aims to return to profit growth this financial year. Dr Martens said it expected to manage around half of its tariff-related costs - forecast in the high-single-digit millions of pounds this financial year - and absorb all costs by the next fiscal year via pricing adjustments in the US and flexible product sourcing. The company has shifted its supply chain away from China, which previously accounted for 50% of its production, to Vietnam and Laos, which are subject to lower US import tariffs. The update comes amid cooling British consumer spending as shoppers await Black Friday deals and the government's budget announcement next week. ""While the marketplace remains uncertain and consumers are cautious, and our biggest trading weeks are ahead, we are confident in our plans for the year,"" said Nwokorie. Dr Martens reported an adjusted pretax loss of £9.2m for the six months to September 28, compared with a £16.6m loss a year earlier. The company also maintained its fiscal 2026 forecast. Its shares were volatile in early deals, rising as much as 3.8% before trading about 4% lower this morning.",centre
"US and UK agree zero tariffs deal on pharmaceuticals - Published The UK and the US have agreed a deal to keep tariffs on UK pharmaceutical shipments into America at zero. Under the agreement the UK will pay more for medicines through the NHS in return for a guarantee that US import taxes on pharmaceuticals made in the UK will remain at zero for three years. This is the first time the amount that the NHS pays for medicines is due to increase in more than 20 years. The deal comes after US President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs to as high as 100% on branded drug imports, one of the UK's biggest exports to the US. Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said the deal ""guarantees that UK pharmaceutical exports â worth at least Â£5bn a year - will enter the US tariff free, protecting jobs, boosting investment and paving the way for the UK to become a global hub for life sciences."" The UK exported Â£11.1bn worth of medicines to the US in the 12 months to the end of September, making up 17.4% of all goods exports in that period, according to the Department for Business and Trade. Pharmaceuticals were not included in the wave of tariffs US President Donald Trump had announced earlier this year. But he has repeatedly threatened to raise tariffs on medicines, citing concerns about America's reliance on medicines made overseas and a desire to increase manufacturing in the US. He has also argued that US consumers effectively subsidise medicines for other developed countries by paying premium prices for those drugs and pushed for other countries to pay more. Under the terms set out on Monday, the UK will increase the price threshold, at which it deems new treatments to be too expensive, by 25%. The UK will also increase the overall amount the NHS spends on medicines, with a target to increase that spending from 0.3% of GDP to 0.6% of GDP over the next 10 years. The amount drug companies must pay back to the NHS to ensure the health system does not overspend its allocated budget will be capped at 15% - last year, drug companies had to pay back more than 20%. In exchange, UK medicine exports will be protected from tariff increases for the next three years. White House spokesman Kush Desai said the agreement with the UK was a ""historic step towards ensuring that other developed countries finally pay their fair share"". The pressure from the US had intensified a long-running row in the UK between the government and the pharmaceuticals industry over drug approvals and the cost of medicines to the NHS. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in August that he was not prepared to let drug companies ""rip off"" the UK, after talks between the government and pharmaceutical firms over the cost of medicines broke down. But subsequently Science Minister Sir Patrick Vallance told the BBC he accepted that the NHS needed to spend more on medicines after seeing its spending on drugs shrink as a percentage of its budget over the last 10 years. The NHS advisory body NICE said the changes were likely to lead to an extra three to five medicines a year being approved - currently it assesses around 70 a year and approves 90% of them. It is not clear what this will cost the NHS - drugs currently account for around 10% of the health budget. But Sally Gainsbury, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the agreement could lead to an extra Â£3 billion being spent on drugs, which was ""bad news"" given how stretched budgets were. ""The extra cost will need to be fully-funded by the Treasury,"" she said, adding that it would be better to invest extra money into areas such as GP services or tackling the hospital backlog instead of new drugs. In announcing the new agreement, the UK government said it was the only country in the world to have secured a zero percent tariff rate for pharmaceutical shipments. European officials have previously said they believed their drugs exports would be protected by terms agreed over the summer, which would cap tariffs on most goods at 15%. It follows pressure on the government after the cancellation or pause of several large pharma investments in the UK over the last 18 months, as firms shift attention to the US. In mid-September, British pharmaceutical giant GSK pledged to invest $30bn (Â£22bn) in research and manufacturing in the US over the next five years. A week before GSK's US investment announcement, US pharmaceutical company Merck - which is called MSD in Europe â revealed it was scrapping its planned Â£1bn expansion of its UK operations. Shortly after, AstraZeneca also announced it was pausing a planned Â£200m investment in a Cambridge research facility. In July, AstraZeneca said it would invest $50bn on medicine manufacturing and research and development in the US. William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said he was pleased to see that the protections from US tariffs that UK officials had promised earlier this year had been delivered. ""This deal is a real win. It will promote exports, boost investment, and enhance UK competitiveness as a production and innovation base for world-leading medicines and treatments,"" he said. US pharmaceutical company Bristol Myers Squibb said it now anticipated being able to invest more than $500m over the next five years in areas including research, development and manufacturing. ""This agreement is a sign of progress and one that creates an environment conducive to our continued presence in the UK,"" chief executive Chris Boerner said. The White House had launched a formal investigation into pharmaceutical imports and their effect on national security in April, taking the first step towards tariffs. In September in a Truth Social post, Trump threatened to raise tariffs on branded drugs - a small subset of the medicine that the US imports - to 100%, but the White House did not put the plan into effect, citing negotiations with manufacturers. In announcing the agreement on Monday, US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr said Americans ""should not pay the world's highest drug costs for medicines they helped fund"". ""This agreement with the United Kingdom strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to USâUK pharmaceutical trade,"" he said in a statement.

"Irish Farmers' Association President Francie Gorman has said Tánaiste Simon Harris should clarify immediately where Fine Gael stands on the Mercosur trade deal. The banned hormones were detected in shipments that arrived into Europe earlier this month. Authorities in a number of countries have removed affected products from sale, and issued recalls where necessary. EU countries impacted by the situation include Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Slovakia. The United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) is also among the countries affected. Yesterday the IFA said the recalls of Brazilian beef raise questions about controls in Brazil. Speaking today, Mr Gorman said the recall of Brazilian beef by the EU authorities in the last month is a very serious matter for the public health of European citizens. Mr Gorman also said that farmers would be concerned to hear Fine Gael MEP Regina Doherty speak in favour of the deal on RTÉ's Today with David McCullough as ""the official position of the Irish Government has been that it is working to oppose the deal."" He said that ""Regina Doherty made a great play of the work under way on safeguards, but this latest revelation shows they are redundant. ""The so-called safeguards make no reference to public health. The findings of the investigation carried out by the IFA and the Irish Farmers Journal last month bear out the complete lack of controls that exist in the production systems in Brazil. The EU authorities cannot have any faith in the control systems in Brazil. Ignoring this is putting public and consumer health at risk,"" he said. The IFA President said all imports should be stopped and food imports removed from the trade deal. ""In the meantime, there is an obligation on the Fine Gael leader to re-affirm his party’s position as set out in the Programme for Government,"" he concluded. Mercosur deal is not just about beef - Doherty Fine Gael's Dublin MEP Regina Doherty said that the Mercosur deal is not just about beef. Speaking on RTÉ's Today with David McCullough, she said; ""beef is a tiny, tiny part of what is overall potentially a very, very good deal for Ireland. ""There will be 700 million new customers for our pharmaceutical industry, for our machinery industry, for our medical equipment, for dairy, for whiskey. ""There'll be real great opportunities for businesses across the country of Ireland, including our farmers"", she said on the same programme. She said that there are concerns ""that have been ventilated for many, many months and still haven't been satisfied. ""And so, the other thing that I would say is that you'd be forgiven for thinking that beef was only going to come from Brazil when we signed this deal. ""With 260 tonnes of Brazilian beef in the European Union last year and probably the same amount this year. ""What the Mercosur deal will do is, number one, limit the amount of tonnage of beef, so therefore hopefully protecting the market, particularly for those people like Irish farmers, French farmers, Polish farmers, that it's really, really important to because we put so much essence into the quality of our production and our beef. ""But second of all, because of the concerns that farmers have raised, the Commission has come up with new SBS standards and checks to make sure that we're going to strengthen the controls on the ground."" Ms Doherty said the withdrawal this morning of products that are on the shelf is because the SBS checks are working. She explained that the SBS checks do not check every single consignment that leaves a country. ""And that's true of every other country that we do trade with around the world. It's true of Northern Ireland, it's true of the UK, it's true of all of the other third countries that we have. ""And we are already doing business with the countries that we're proposing to do a free trade deal with, which is what so-called Mercosur. ""The new consignments, restrictions, the strengthening of the SBS standards, the safeguards that we're discussing at our committees this week are an attempt by the Commission to reassure farmers who have raised concerns, and rightly so, because it's their income and it's their protection of their livelihoods and the standards that we cherish in Ireland. ""Those new safeguards will provide those extra measures of protection. And if it doesn't work, then there will be penalties. ""And that's not to say we expect it not to work, but as you can see this morning, not everything is infallible but what really is reassuring is that those consignments were identified near immediately and there have been recalled and be taken off our shelves and so we know that those SBS checks are working."" System 'just doesn't work', says Independent Ireland MEP Independent Ireland MEP for Midlands Northwest Ciaran Mullooly said farmers' concerns are down to health and safety and traceability about any beef that may come into this country under the deal, ""particularly from Brazil"". Also speaking on Today with David McCullough, he said that in the past ""we were told left, right, and center of the dangers"" of hormone growth promoters in cattle ""and we dealt with it."" However, he said, those illegal growth promoters are still on sale in Brazil, ""And worse again, the Farmers Journal proved that last week with their survey, worse again, they've got through this great system the European Commission told us about in recent weeks. ""They got through it. They got through the abattoir test in Brazil. They got into Europe. ""And what have we got in the last couple of days? A recall of meat products right across Europe, proving that the system just doesn't work"". He said that the system is supposed to work at abattoir level in Brazil. ""That's what we told by the commission for the last two years. The rigorous tests were talked about, the rigorous concerns at that stage, they didn't work. Mr Mullooly said that ""there's a cultural problem here. They went across 3,000km. ""They went to 14 different shops. They weren't even asked for an identification themselves, a cattle, a card number, a herd number for an animal. ""There's no culture in Brazil of logging the use of antibiotics in animal feed or in animal prescriptions. ""And you know what happens as a result? It goes into the food chain"". He said ""it is undeniable that that has serious implications for all of us down the line, because the overuse of antibiotics is bad news for public health."" He added; ""if we have it in the food chain coming through, it will be disastrous. ""And the problem is for Irish farmers, we can watch the health concerns, and if the politicians say we're not interested, we'll also watch our industry fall apart because our beef trade will suffer. ""The Brazilian farmers just simply don't have the same cost base"". The European Commission is pushing for the ratification of Mercosur, which would create the world's biggest free-trade zone and significantly increase EU exports to Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Mercosur countries would be able to export up to 99,000 tonnes of beef into the EU at a much-reduced tariff rate of 7.5%, as well as 180,000 tonnes of poultry. Several EU member states, notably Ireland and France, are opposed to its ratification, citing the potential to massively distort key agricultural markets. Additional reporting: Aengus Cox",centre
"Global growth is holding up better than expected as an artificial intelligence investment boom helps offset some of the shock from US tariff hikes, the OECD said today, nudging up its outlook for some major economies. The Paris-based organisation warned, however, that global growth was vulnerable to any new outbreak of trade tensions while investor optimism about AI could trigger a stock market correction if expectations are not met. In its Economic Outlook, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast global growth would slow modestly from 3.2% in 2025 to 2.9% in 2026, leaving its forecasts untouched from its last estimates in September. It predicted a rebound to 3.1% in 2027. OECD head Mathias Cormann said the trade shocks triggered by US President Donald Trump's tariff hikes had so far proved relatively mild, but added their costs were likely to rise. ""The full effects of those higher tariffs since the start of the year will become clearer as firms run down the inventoriesthat they built up,"" he told a press conference. Upgraded growth forecasts for 2025, but risks remain The US economy is forecast to grow 2% in 2025, revised up from 1.8% in September, before slowing to 1.7% in 2026 - up from 1.5% predicted in September. AI investment, fiscal support and expected Federal Reserve rate cuts are helping offset the drag from tariffs on imported goods, reduced immigration and federal job cuts, the OECD said. However, it warned that the Trump administration had put US fiscal policy on an unsustainable trajectory with large budget deficits and rising debt that would require a ""significant adjustment"" in the coming years. China's growth is expected to hold steady at 5% in 2025, up from 4.9% in September, before slowing to 4.4% in 2026 - unchanged from September - as fiscal support fades and new US tariffs on goods imported from China bite. The euro zone's 2025 growth forecast was revised up to 1.3% from 1.2%, supported by resilient labour markets and increased public spending in Germany. Growth is expected to moderate to1.2% in 2026 - it was seen at 1% previously - as budget tightening in France and Italy weighs on the outlook. Japan's economy is projected to grow 1.3% in 2025, up from 1.1%, and buoyed by strong corporate earnings and investment, before slowing to 0.9% in 2026. Trade and inflation outlook Global trade growth is expected to moderate from 4.2% in 2025 to 2.3% in 2026 as the full effects of tariffs weigh on investment and consumption. Elevated trade policy uncertainty limits prospects for a recovery. Inflation is projected to gradually return to central bank targets by mid-2027 in most major economies. In the US, inflation is expected to peak in mid-2026 due to tariff pass-through before easing. In China and some emerging markets, inflation is projected to rise modestly as excess production capacity declines. Most major central banks are expected to maintain or lower borrowing costs over the coming year as inflation pressuresease. The Federal Reserve is projected to cut rates slightly by the end of 2026, barring inflation surprises from tariffs.",centre
"5 ways Republicans are breaking with Trump President Trump is facing increasing resistance from Republicans in Congress to certain proposals and parts of his agenda as he nears the end of his first year back in office. Trump remains the unquestioned leader of the Republican Party, and aides have argued that any lawmakers who fall out of line risk facing a primary or losing the president’s support. But that hasn’t stopped GOP lawmakers from criticizing Trump’s actions or rebuffing some of his demands. A handful of Republicans bucked public pressure from the White House earlier this month to sign a discharge petition to force the release of files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. That break with the White House is perhaps a sign of things to come. Here are five other areas where Republicans are breaking with Trump. Foreign policy Trump has spent much of his first year back in office focused on brokering deals abroad to resolve conflicts, but his approach has frustrated different factions of the Republican Party. The White House has touted progress on a peace agreement that could end the fighting in Ukraine nearly four years after Russian forces launched an invasion. But the initial proposal was panned by lawmakers like Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who raised concerns that it was too deferential to Russia and would not yield a lasting peace in Ukraine. “If Administration officials are more concerned with appeasing Putin than securing real peace, then the President ought to find new advisors,” McConnell, who is retiring after next year, said in a fiery statement. Trump’s backers have also been divided over his continued military support for Israel amid its war against Hamas in the Middle East. One of the most outspoken Republicans to take issue with Trump’s handling of Israel has been Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.). The congresswoman, once one of Trump’s most outspoken supporters, has spent weeks criticizing Republican leadership and argued Trump was not focused enough on domestic issues. She announced amid a widening rift with Trump that she would resign from Congress in January. Trump is also facing Republican criticism as he takes an increasingly aggressive posture toward Venezuela. The Pentagon has repositioned assets near Venezuela, raising concerns that the White House is preparing for conflict with the Maduro regime. “If he invades Venezuela or gives more money to Ukraine, his movement will dissolve,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said last week. On Saturday, the House Armed Services Committee said it will probe the administration after The Washington Post reported Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered to leave no survivors in the first strike in Venezuela. “We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” Reps. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said in a statement. Tariff dividend checks The president has in recent weeks floated an idea to use money from tariff revenue to send out $2,000 checks to millions of Americans. Trump has been facing pressure to take action to lower costs for Americans as polling shows public frustration with the high cost of living. One solution from the White House would be to turn money brought in by tariffs into money in Americans’ pockets. One major problem? It would require congressional action, and many Republicans are not on board. “Look, we can’t afford it. I wish we were in a position to return the American public their money, but we’re not,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo last week. Other Republicans have for weeks offered a message similar to the Wisconsin senator’s. Deficit hawks in Congress have argued that any money brought in from tariff revenue should be used to reduce the national debt, which is more than $38 trillion. “The amount of revenue coming in from the tariffs is considered to be substantial at this point and hopefully can be put to a useful purpose, in my view one of which would be repaying the debt,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said earlier this month. Trump’s idea for a tariff dividend has been a recurring one throughout his second term so far. He initially raised the prospect of a “DOGE Dividend,” using money from contracts eliminated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to send cash to Americans. But that idea failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill, as Republicans again argued any savings should be used to lower the debt. Artificial intelligence policy Trump has repeatedly talked about the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and the need for the U.S. to own the issue, and his administration has taken steps to expand the use of AI. Trump last week signed an executive order establishing the “Genesis Mission,” a new effort to create an integrated AI platform that brings together federal datasets, computing resources and AI tools to boost scientific research. The administration earlier this month crafted a draft executive order that would create a task force to challenge state AI laws and block broadband funding for states that implement regulations around the technology. But the president’s push to expand the use of AI has prompted blowback from some conservatives who are wary of the technology. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has been an outspoken critic of technology companies, and he has raised additional concerns about the growing use of AI. Hawley previously called for the repeal of a law that offers legal protections to major tech companies, specifically citing their training of AI models on copyrighted works. Steve Bannon, a former top Trump adviser and influential voice in the MAGA movement, called AI “the most dangerous technology in the history of mankind” on his radio show. “Technology has tremendous upside if properly guided,” Bannon said last week. “But unguided, incredibly dangerous.” Redistricting The White House has pushed Republicans in red states to redraw their congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterms with the goal of adding a few more safe GOP seats to help the party retain the majority. Texas and Missouri delivered on the administration’s wishes, but that hasn’t been the case everywhere. Indiana Republicans in particular have expressed reservations about redistricting, drawing Trump’s ire. Leaders in the Indiana House and Senate announced each chamber would make a final decision in early December on whether to pursue redistricting. Trump welcomed the latest development, and he cautioned Indiana lawmakers against opposing his wishes. “I am glad to hear the Indiana House is stepping up to do the right thing, and I hope the Senate finds the Votes,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “If they do, I will make sure that all of those people supporting me win their Primaries, and go on to Greatness but, if they don’t, I will partner with the incredibly powerful MAGA Grassroots Republicans to elect STRONG Republicans who are ready to do what is needed to protect our Country and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump has also faced some pushback from Republicans at the national level on redistricting, specifically those at risk of losing their seats because of the partisan battle to redraw maps. Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) has been an outspoken critic of the redistricting wars and has introduced legislation that would ban all mid-decade redistricting efforts nationwide. End the filibuster and blue slips Trump has for months expressed frustration with the rules governing the Senate, and he has turned up the pressure on Republican senators to do away with regulations like the filibuster and blue slip policy. As the record-setting government shutdown dragged on, Trump turned to social media to repeatedly urge senators to eliminate the filibuster, which requires legislation to garner 60 votes to pass the chamber. He even made the case to senators in person at a White House breakfast earlier this month. But Trump’s pleas have done little to sway Republicans who view the filibuster as an important tool to protect the rights of the minority party, and who see abandoning the procedure as a risky move. Thune has said his position on keeping the filibuster has not changed. Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) has said he is a “firm no” on eliminating the filibuster. “The filibuster has traditionally been viewed as a very important safeguard. If the shoe was on the other foot, I don’t think our team would like it,” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said earlier this month. Trump has also taken issue with the Senate’s “blue slip” tradition, under which home-state senators can veto District Court judge and U.S. attorney nominees. The president has urged senators to ditch the policy, arguing Democrats have used it to slow down the confirmation of nominees in certain posts. But a change to that policy lacks support as well, with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) pushing back from his perch as head of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Grassley has argued that a nominee who does not have a blue slip returned does not have the votes to get confirmed. “As chairman I set Pres Trump noms up for SUCCESS NOT FAILURE,” Grassley posted on the social platform X in August.

"Japan's economy shrank almost 2% in the three months to September, as a drop in exports in the face of US tariffs resulted in the first contraction in six quarters, government data showed today. Shipments from carmakers in particular plummeted, following a period of hiking exports before tariffs came into effect. Still, as the overall contraction was not as acute as expected, it likely represents a temporary setback rather than the start of a recession, economists said. ""The contraction is largely due to one-time factors such as housing investment"" affected by regulatory change, said economist Kazutaka Maeda at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute. ""Exports also reacted,"" he said. ""Overall, the economy lacks strong underlying momentum, but the trend still points to a gradual recovery over the next year or two."" Economists generally viewed this quarter's GDP figures as having a marginal impact on Bank of Japan thinking when next deciding interest rates versus factors such as inflation. However, an economist close to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi gave the data more weight. Given the contraction, it ""would be misguided for the Bank of Japan to decide to raise interest rates"" in December, Credit Agricole chief Japan economist Takuji Aida, who is on Takaichi's flagship panel tasked with laying out the country's growth strategy, said in a report to clients. Japan's gross domestic product contracted 1.8% in the three months from July to September. That compared with revised growth of 2.3% in the previous three-month period, as well as the 2.5% contraction that economists on average estimated in a Reuters poll. The reading also translated into a quarterly contraction of 0.4% compared to the median estimate of 0.6%. Exports constituted the main drag as the impact of higher US tariffs intensified. Automakers saw shipment volume plunge, reversing earlier front-loaded exports ahead of tariff hikes, though they mostly absorbed tariffs by cutting prices. Net external demand, or exports minus imports, knocked 0.2 of a percentage point off growth, versus a 0.2 point positive contribution in April-June. The US and Japan formalised an agreement in September that implemented a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, compared to an initial 27.5% on cars and 25% for most other goods. Japanese housing investment also weighed on growth as tighter energy-efficiency regulation introduced in April slowed commitments. Private consumption, which accounts for over half of economic output, grew 0.1%, matching a market estimate. That was cooler than the 0.4% of the second quarter, indicating that high food costs increased reluctance to spend. Capital spending, another key driver of private demand-led growth, rose 1.0% in the third quarter, far exceeding a market estimate of 0.3%. ""Private consumption rose for the sixth straight quarter, and capital expenditure increased for the fourth consecutive quarter,"" Minoru Kiuchi, the economic revitalisation minister, said in a statement. ""This reinforces our view that the economy remains on a moderate recovery path,"" he said. Private-sector estimates reflect expectation for growth to rebound in October-December. A poll of 37 economists by the Japan Center for Economic Research projected a 0.6% expansion. The weak GDP data comes as Takaichi's government compiles a stimulus package to help households manage rising living costs. Advisers to Takaichi have cited a likely sharp GDP contraction as a reason for aggressive stimulus measures. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama told reporters over the weekend that proposed economic stimulus would exceed 17 trillion yen ($109.94 billion), media reported.",centre
"AIB has upgraded its forecast for growth in the domestic Irish economy, as the bank said the uncertainty created by the imposition of US tariffs has ""begun to dissipate."" In its latest Economic Outlook Report, AIB said Ireland's economy has proven ""robust"" to global uncertainty and an escalation in trade tariffs. The bank said it has led to a ""stronger than previously expected outlook for the domestic economy."" ""However, geopolitical uncertainty remains high and because of that consumer spending and business investment growth in Ireland are still expected to cool,"" it added. Since its last outlook report, the bank has revised upwards its forecast for modified domestic demand (MDD), which is a better measure of domestic activity in the economy. It now expects MDD, which increased by 2.7% last year, to grow by 3.2% in 2025, 2.5% next year and 2.7% in 2027, amid an ""improved international outlook."" In May, AIB forecast MDD growth slowing to 2.3% this year and to 2% in 2026, before bouncing back to 2.6% in 2027. In terms of employment levels, the bank said the labour market will continue to grow, but it said given the expected easing in economic growth next year, it expects ""a more modest expansion in employment."" Following a 2.7% rise in 2024, AIB has forecasted employment growth slowing to 2.1% in 2025, 1.7% in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027. The bank said further shifts in US trade and economic policy are among the main downside risks to the Irish economy. It said while some indigenous Irish export sectors may now be exposed to higher US tariffs, there have also been some key carve outs below the headline 15% rate for generic pharmaceuticals and aircraft parts in the EU-US trade deal. ""This should mean Ireland’s effective tariff settles below that headline 15% rate,"" according to AIB. ""In terms of upside risks, a further easing in global uncertainty could underpin stronger domestic spending and investment in the coming years,"" it added. Commenting on the report, AIB’s chief economist said the global macro backdrop has ""improved since our last Economic Outlook in May 2025."" David McNamara said the uncertainty created by the dramatic shift in US trade policy in April is still elevated, but he said the EU-US trade deal has also ""brought some predictability for exporters."" ""Amid this volatility, the Irish economy has been robust, but there are some signs of cooling, particularly in the labour market,"" he said. ""For the domestic economy we expect an easing in growth next year, as ongoing uncertainty dampens both consumer spending and business investment growth,"" he added. Mr McNamara said while the risks remain tilted to the downside, ""the Irish economy has shown remarkable resilience to global shocks in recent years, and the economy is set to continue to outperform European peers."" In terms of gross domestic product (GDP), which includes the activity of multinational companies, AIB has also revised upwards its growth forecast. The bank now expects GDP to grow by 9.1% this year, slowing to 3.8% next year, with growth of 3.5% in 2027. AIB said Irish GDP remains ""a volatile gauge of activity, as evidenced by the sharp swings in growth in recent quarters, but the globalised nature of Ireland’s GDP also reveals the impact of tariff front-running in the global economy."" ""In the first half of 2025, GDP grew by an enormous 18% year-on-year, driven almost entirely by activity and exports from Ireland’s multinational sector. ""While this surge in exports is now starting to ebb, there are also signs of structural factors driving the recent growth in Irish manufacturing,"" it added. The bank notes that Ireland has become ""a production hub for the weight-loss drug market, from which a specific hormone derivative product accounted for 56%, by value, of all Irish pharma exports to the US in H1 2025, compared to just 8% in H1 2024."" AIB said the surge in global demand for weight-loss drugs is ""likely to underpin Irish pharma exports in the near term."" It said it highlights ""the increasing importance of a small number of firms for Irish GDP, and the growing reliance of the Exchequer on associated tax receipts.""",centre
"Ireland's gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to grow exceptionally by 10.7% in 2025, mainly due to strong export activity in the first half of the year, the European Commission said in its Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast today. As the frontloading of exports effect unwinds, growth is expected to moderate to 0.2% in 2026, reflecting a technical base effect from 2025 dynamics, before stabilising at 2.9% in 2027, the EU said. Inflation is projected to remain contained, while the labour market is expected to continue expanding, it added. Today's report also said the outlook for public finances is positive but marked by significant risks to corporation tax revenues. Meanwhile, the euro zone economy will grow faster than earlier expected in 2025, the European Commission also forecast today, mainly thanks to a surge in exports in the first half of the year ahead of expected tariff increases. The EU executive arm said gross domestic product in the 20 countries that share the euro currency would grow 1.3% this year, rather than 0.9% as forecast last April, and up from 0.9% growth in 2024. But growth is to slow marginally to 1.2% in 2026, a downward revision of the Commission's own 1.4% forecast from April, before accelerating again to 1.4% growth in 2027. ""Initially fuelled by a surge in exports in anticipation of tariff increases, the steady - albeit modest -growth observed so far highlights the resilience of the EU economy in the face of a challenging external environment,"" the Commission said. ""Inflation is nearing the ECB target, and financing conditions have improved,"" the forecast said. Consumer price growth in the euro zone is to slow to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026 from 2.4% last year, the Commission said. But despite the faster growth, public finances are to deteriorate, with the euro zone aggregated budget deficit rising to 3.2% of GDP this year from 3.1% last year and expanding further to 3.3% in 2026 and 3.4% in 2027. Aggregated euro zone public debt is also to increase, the Commission said, going up to 88.8% of GDP this year from 88.1% in 2024 and then to 89.8% in 2026 and 90.4% in 2027. The budget deficit of the euro zone's biggest economy Germany is to jump to 4% of GDP next year from 3.1% this year and 2.7% in 2024, mainly as a result of higher defence spending. The second biggest euro zone economy France is expected to cut it budget gap to 5.5% of GDP this year from 5.8% in 2024 despite its government crisis, the Commission forecast. The French budget gap is to fall to 4.9% in 2026, it forecast.",centre
"Manufacturing was weak in the US, Europe and Asia's biggest economies in November, business surveys showed today, as subdued domestic demand and tariff uncertainties weighed. The United States, euro zone, China and Japan all saw manufacturing activity contract last month although there were bright spots for Britain and economies in Southeast Asia, which saw growth, purchasing managers' surveys showed. Factory activity contracted for the ninth straight month in the US amid slumping orders and higher prices for inputs. Euro zone manufacturing activity slipped back into contraction territory last month, its purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed, and Germany's dominant manufacturing sector experienced a marked deterioration in business conditions. While weakening demand in the euro zone forced firms to cut jobs at the quickest rate in seven months, in Germany- Europe's largest economy - new orders fell at the fastest rate in 10 months. ""Current conditions remain at best subdued, with output trending down from an already weak level, reflecting the combination of headwinds faced by the manufacturing sector, including tariffs, heightened Chinese competition and general economic uncertainty,"" said Leo Barincou, senior economist at Oxford Economics. ""The persistent industrial slump appears to be putting pressure on headcount, with firms shedding jobs at the fastest pace since April. Meanwhile, weak demand means that firms were unable to transmit the rise in input costs to their selling prices."" In China, the world's largest manufacturer, factory activity slipped back into a slight contraction, a private-sector PMI showed, a day after Beijing's official measure indicated activity falling for the eighth consecutive month, albeit at a slower pace. ""Container throughput at Chinese ports was little changed last month compared to October. To the extent that demand did improve, it didn't do much to support production amid already high inventory levels - the output component dropped to a four-month low,"" said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. ""And while the output price component edged up slightly, it stayed at a low level, pointing to persistent deflationary pressures."" MANUFACTURING PICKS UP IN BRITAIN Among major European economies, France's manufacturing sector contracted further in November as a drop in production and slower demand for goods hit the sector. S&P Global's survey said demand for French goods had continued to weaken in November, extending the current sequence of declining factory orders to three-and-a-half years. Italy's manufacturing sector crept back into growth territory in November, a positive sign for its struggling economy. In Britain, outside the European Union, the manufacturing sector recorded its first increase in activity since September 2024 last month, bolstered by improved domestic demand and less of a slowdown in orders from overseas. Meanwhile, Asia's other manufacturing powerhouses also struggled with sluggish demand in November, extending declines in factory activity, as progress in U.S. trade negotiations failed to translate into a significant recovery in orders. Japan's PMI showed new orders continued to decline, stretching the downturn to two-and-a-half years. Across Asia this year, businesses in major exporting nations have been scrambling to navigate the uncertainty created by US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. While Trump's trade deals with countries like Japan and South Korea and lowered tensions with China have given firms some confidence, many are still adjusting to the new US trade reality. South Korea's factory activity contracted for a second month in November. However, separate data showed Korean exports rose in November for a sixth consecutive month, beating market expectations, as chip sales hit a record on strong technology demand while autos also jumped after a US trade deal. Taiwan's PMI showed factory activity continued to fall, but at a slower pace. Elsewhere in Asia, emerging-market manufacturers remained outperformers with Indonesia and Vietnam both reporting brisk growth in factory activity and Malaysia swinging back to growth.",centre
"Toyota has today raised its full-year profit forecast, as the Japanese automaker bet solid performance outside the US would help it ride out the impact of US President Donald Trump's import tariffs. The world's top-selling carmaker now expects operating profit of 3.4 trillion yen ($22.6 billion) for the financial year to end-March, up 6% from the 3.2 trillion yen it previously forecast. US tariffs have dealt a body blow to an industry already smarting from fierce competition from China's EV makers and a once-in-a-century upheaval brought by the advance of new driving technology. Toyota estimated the tariffs would cost it 1.45 trillion yen in the current financial year. ""North America is facing a very tough situation due to the impact of tariffs,"" Chief Financial Officer Kenta Kon told a results briefing. While conditions ""were not easy"" in other markets such as China, Europe, Asia and Africa, both profitability and sales volume remained ""solid"", he said. For the quarter, operating profit tumbled 27% to 839.6 billion yen, falling short of the 863.1 billion yen average in a survey of eight analysts by LSEG. That marked its second decline in quarterly profits in a row. In a sign of the strain from tariffs, Toyota's North American business swung to a loss of 134 billion yen for the first half of the year, even as demand for its vehicles in the region remained strong, leading to tight inventories. Kon's deputy Takanori Azuma told the briefing that markets such as India were increasingly becoming important to profits and helping offset the battering in the US. A decade ago, Toyota's profit structure was heavily dependent on North America, with nearly half of profits coming from there, Azuma said. ""If tariffs had become an issue under those circumstances, the impact would have been much greater,"" he said. Toyota said last week its worldwide production increased by more than 10% in September and rose for a fourth month in a row, as both sales and output increased in the US, its top market. Toyota shares stayed deep in negative territory on Wednesday, closing down 3.65% compared to a loss of 2.5% in the Nikkei index.",centre
"The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) has said an investigation carried out by the Irish Farmers Journal (IFJ) in Brazil undermines arguments by the European Commission that the EU-Mercosur trade deal should be approved. The IFJ investigation claims to have been able to buy animal antibiotics in Brazil without prescriptions, and hormones which are banned in the EU. The commission is pushing for the ratification of the agreement, which would create the world's biggest free-trade zone and significantly increase EU exports to Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Mercosur countries would be able to export up to 99,000 tonnes of beef into the EU at a much-reduced tariff rate of 7.5%, as well as 180,000 tonnes of poultry. A number of EU member states, notably Ireland and France, are opposed to its ratification, citing the potential to massively distort key agricultural markets. In its report, the IFJ claims its Beef Editor Adam Woods - who recently travelled to Brazil - was able to complete wholesale purchases of animal antibiotics without prescriptions, and that hormones given to animals that are banned in the EU were freely available to buy. The publication said it recorded undercover video footage to document the purchases. The IFA confirmed its Senior Policy Officer Tomás Bourke accompanied Mr Woods and the photo editor of the IFJ on the trip. According to the farming organisation, ""the team were able to walk into over a dozen agri-stores in Brazil and buy any amount of antibiotics without showing any prescription, ID or herd number and were not asked any questions whatsoever about why they needed the products"". IFA President Francie Gorman said that ""having viewed the findings ... the EU Commission cannot stand over what is going on in Brazil from the viewpoint of the use of animal medicines and the lack of traceability"". Mr Gorman said: ""This flies in the face of all EU protocols in the fight against anti-microbial resistance (AMR) in humans."" Mr Gorman also called for the Mercosur deal ""to be stopped"". He added: ""It completely undermines arguments by the EU Commission that the Mercosur trade deal should be approved because there will be an equivalence of standards between the Mercosur countries and the EU."" In September, the European Commission said the same food safety and animal health standards that apply to EU farmers will also apply to South American producers, who will be subject to the same licensing requirements and audits. At the time, the commission also said it would be stepping up import controls by increasing the number of audits and checks in third countries.",centre
"Irish whiskey distillers have renewed their call on the Government and the EU to step up efforts to secure a zero-for-zero trading deal with the US for their products. The call was made as the industry launched a new tourism initiative aimed at attracting more visitors to distilleries around the country. The Irish Whiskey Way is designed to showcase 26 distilleries across the island in the five designated tourist regions, including the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, Ireland’s Ancient East, Dublin and Northern Ireland. It is aimed at promoting Ireland’s food and drinks trails to international and domestic visitors. The Irish Whiskey Way was launched by Minister for Enterprise and Tourism Peter Burke at the Kilbeggan Distillery Experience in Co Westmeath. Mr Burke described it as ""a unique initiative that celebrates one of Ireland’s most iconic exports while showcasing the rich culture, heritage and hospitality that makes our country and this region so special"". ""This journey will not only highlight the craftsmanship behind Irish whiskey but also connect visitors with the vibrant communities, food experiences and stories that define Ireland,"" he said. In the year to June, just over one million people toured Irish whiskey distilleries, a 23% increase in the number of visitors compared to the previous year. It is hoped the new whiskey trail will help to build on those numbers. Chief Executive of Tourism Ireland Alice Mansergh said it will provide a boost to the tourism sector. Ms Mansergh said it will enable visitors to ""experience the 700-year history of whiskey on this island"". ""It's really significant that the distilleries themselves have reported a million visitors over the past year, so we can see that at the moment, tourism is good for whiskey, and whiskey is good for tourism too,"" she said. Director of the Irish Whiskey Association Eoin Ó Catháin said the new initiative was developed by whiskey distilleries ""working together to present a unique food and drink trail to the international and domestic visitor"". Mr Ó Catháin said the importance of cooperation ""has never been greater, this year more than ever, and the value of every euro spent in Ireland has never been more appreciated"". The initiative has been launched against the backdrop of the 15% tariffs on goods being exported from the EU to the US, which is the biggest export market for Irish whiskey. Amid the initial uncertainty over the trade levy, up to 90% of whiskey production here was paused. While for the most part it has resumed, distillers say the levy is putting significant pressure on the sector, as businesses absorb the costs. Mr Ó Catháin said about 45% to 50% of Irish whiskey is exported to the US, ""so that 15% tariff is a tax on that that ultimately the producers must pay"". He said the sector is hopeful because he said there ""seems to be some momentum building this week, discussions are ongoing about maybe a tariff exemption for products like ours."" ""We know that we have strong advocates, both in government in Dublin, and in Brussels, in the European Commission. ""We need to make sure that we're still in the conversation, and that exemptions, when they do come on the table, include the whiskey sector,"" he added. Mr Ó Catháin said the fact that the tariff is there is ""still causing some uncertainty"". ""It is harder to attract investment. I think what we're seeing is that further investment or further expansion in the US market is now being impacted,"" he added. However, Mr Ó Catháin said there are new markets being opened up, as companies diversify. ""We're having great success throughout the EU and throughout emerging markets in Asia and Africa,"" he said. In Brussels on Monday, Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee raised the easing of the trade tariffs on a number of Irish products, including whiskey, at the EU trade council, ahead of talks with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer. Peter Burke said there is ""no doubt it's a very significant challenge for the sector"". ""What we are trying to do is to get those key carve outs. Obviously, drinks is key in terms of tariffs and the viability of it and I know they have a very strong ask for zero-for-zero and it’s one which the government is really trying to work on,"" Mr Burke said. ""We're trying to work on those key sectors, like drinks, like pharma, all those that are so important for the strategic success of our economy,"" he added.

"Gap has beaten Wall Street expectations for third-quarter comparable sales and profit, helped by strong marketing-driven demand for its Old Navy and Banana Republic brand apparel. Shares of the company rose about 5% in extended trading on Wall Street last night. The clothing maker has banked on efforts such as introducing limited-edition products in collaboration with Disney, Netflix's ""Stranger Things"", and Universal's ""Wicked"" to drive sales. Initiatives such as ""Better in Denim"" featuring global girl group Katseye, and campaigns such as ""Feels Like Gap"" and ""Get Loose with Troye Sivan"", helped Gap boost its brand relevance among Gen Z shoppers. Gap last month announced the launch of an affordable beauty and personal care line for this fall in a bid to diversify beyond apparel. The company reiterated its forecast for a US tariff impact on its annual operating margin between 100 and 110 basis points. Gap sources less than 10% of its merchandise from China as of 2024. CEO Richard Dickson had said in May the company expects reliance on China to be less than 3% by the end of 2025. For the third quarter, comparable sales rose 5%, beating expectations of 3.26% growth, according to data compiled by LSEG. Comparable sales for Old Navy and namesake Gap brand rose 6% and 7% respectively, while Banana Republic grew 4%. Meanwhile, comparable sales for Athleta, Gap's athleisure brand, fell 11%, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of decline. It has been narrowing its assortment to focus on items in demand such as women's activewear to turn around the business. ""Athleta continues to be the biggest drag on the company,"" eMarketer analyst Sky Canaves said, adding that there are no indications of concrete progress on the horizon despite plans for a brand reset. Gap's quarterly revenue rose 3% to $3.94 billion, narrowly surpassing expectations of $3.91 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of 62 cents beat expectations of 59 cents.",centre

"The Irish Road Hauliers Association has criticised Dublin Port's plan to significantly raise its charges on goods shipments from next year. The port plans to raise the charge levied on unaccompanied shipping containers by 5%, raising the base price of a 40ft container to €38.33. There will also be a new €15 infrastructure charge - which amounts to an effective 46% increase in the charges levied on a container compared to 2025. ""We feel that these costs are a tariff on companies doing business in Ireland,"" said Ger Hyland, President of the Irish Road Hauliers Association.

Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences Dublin Port has said the higher charges and new levy are required to support the next phase of its €2 billion Masterplan 2040. That aims to double capacity at the port over the next 15 years. Outlining the rationale for its new charging structure, the Dublin Port Company said the port is currently running at close to capacity, making such a large-scale investment necessary. As the port is self-funding, it said, it is required to raise charges to cover the cost. The port company also said that this significant increase in charges comes on the back of two decades of relatively small change. It said charges had been flat between 2004 and 2021, with more modest increases introduced in recent years. ""However this was also in the context of a smaller capital programme,"" its charges update said. ""For context, the average annual capital spend between 2015 and 2024 was c.€65m with the same figure for 2025-2030 envisaged to be c.€170m – an increase of c.160%."" Mr Hyland agreed that investment was needed to ensure the port's capacity could keep up with demand, however he said there should be a different approach taken in funding that. ""The traffic throughput through Dublin Port over those two decades has been enormous,"" he said. ""So they've got their price increases in the upturn in freight that has come in and out of this country. ""There is also synergies there where there can be money saved."" He also said that the higher cost of shipping would inevitably be passed on to consumers. ""It's going to be seen in every shopping basket and every shopping trolley in Ireland,"" Mr Hyland said. ""Every euro that hits the shopping trolley at the present time is an attack on the consumer. ""Our hauliers and our logistics people, the container companies, they can't take this charge so it effectively has to be passed on."" According to Dublin Port, the new charges will mean a €16.83 increase in the cost of an unaccompanied shipping container, with an accompanied container costing €15.70 more. The Central Statistics Office estimates that the average shipping container coming through the port contains €100,000 worth of goods.",centre
"Dutch medical technology company Philips has today reported third-quarter profit above market expectations, helped by measures to mitigate the impact of tariffs and the launch of artificial intelligence tools. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) came in at €531m, surpassing the €484m expected by analysts. Its sales grew 3%, matching analysts expectations at €4.3 billion, driven by a strong performance in North America. Philips, which makes most of its revenue in the US, flagged a lower-than expected impact from US tariffs. CEO Roy Jakobs said in a call with reporters that the performance reflected investments in its supply chain to mitigate tariff impacts in the US and China. ""At the same time, we keep advocating that actually every dollar, euro, RMB spent on tariffs is not spent on patients. And actually healthcare is under enough pressure that they don't need additional pressure from tariffs,"" he added. Jakobs brushed off concerns regarding Nexperia, saying Philips does not use their chips. The chipmaker sparked Netherlands-China tensions when the Dutch government seized control in September. Philips today also reiterated its full year sales and earnings guidance. Philips is racing to develop AI-powered medical tools in patient monitoring, scanner and imagery, and diagnosis assistance. From January to September of this year, Philips spent €1.23 billion on R&D.

"Analysis: Key macroeconomic indicators may be positive, but the cost of living continues to be the biggest priority for much of the population It has been a challenging year with increasing geopolitical tensions, tariff threats and economic policy uncertainty, yet key macroeconomic indicators for Ireland remain positive. The domestic economy is forecast to grow around 3% this year and continued growth is expected over the next two years. Recent data from the CSO shows that the number of people employed in the country is at another record high, albeit an increase in the unemployment rate indicates a slowdown in the labour market. Real wage growth has been positive for the last 18 months, reflecting average wage increases higher than inflation and therefore increased purchasing power. But despite such headline figures, the cost of living was one of the top two priorities for 41% of the population in the latest poll from Ireland Thinks, second only to housing at 50%. With inflation a key concern for so many citizens and the inflation rate creeping to 2.9% last month, are we still in a cost of living crisis?

For Ireland, the perception gap between actual and perceived inflation was relatively small in early 2022, but as Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove up price levels, the resulting cost of living increases dominated the national discourse. Although inflation peaked towards the end of 2022, perception gaps actually widened as the inflation rate fell. In many subsequent months, people perceived the inflation rate to be more than double the actual rate. One reason for this disconnect between perception and reality is use of the availability heuristic, a mental shortcut whereby people rely heavily on information that is readily available to them in making assessments or decisions. As media coverage, political debate and water cooler discussions focused on the rising price level, more information on price rises became available, biasing perceptions upwards. Another explanation for the overestimation of recent average price increases is that inflation perceptions are subject to frequency bias. Over the past few years, higher food prices have contributed to overall price level increases and the prices of many products frequently purchased by Irish households have increased substantially.

For example, since December 2023, the price of beef has increased by nearly 27%, chocolate by 23%, and butter by 18%. Consumers' perceptions of overall levels of inflation are biased towards the inflation rates of items they purchase more often, so these high rates for commonly purchased items results in a higher perception of overall price increases. Even though the prices of goods we buy less frequently may not have risen by as much, or may even have fallen in some cases, the price increases of the goods we buy most often are the most salient. Nevertheless, even when biases result in perceived inflation rates that are higher than objectively measured cost of living increases, it could still be the case that average households are struggling to pay their bills. One way to determine if this is the case is to look at household spending on items that are not necessities like groceries, rent or electricity. Discretionary spending on items that are wants rather than needs (such as meals out or cinema tickets) and spending on durable goods (such as washing machines or televisions) can be tracked to determine whether households are in financial difficulty. When budgets are squeezed, spending on necessities is prioritised and other types of consumption spending are reduced. However, recent household data shows that both discretionary spending and spending on durable goods have increased year on year, 4.6% and 8% respectively, indicating that on average households are coping with the cost of living.

Poorer households who spend a much higher proportion of their income on essentials such as food and energy have faced higher rates of inflation than wealthier households. Recent analysis from the ESRI found that inflation rates in 2022-2023 were 7% higher for the lowest income households and 5% lower for the highest income households than headline inflation rates. While average households and those in the upper half of the income distribution do not need cost of living supports, there is a significant minority who are struggling.

"Trump’s 28-point Ukraine peace plan catches Congress off guard The Trump administration is renewing a push to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, with a reported 28-point peace plan that caught Kyiv’s supporters in Congress off guard and left at least one Republican warning against what appears to be a largely pro-Moscow proposal. The plan was reportedly worked out by President Trump’s top envoy for peace negotiations, Steve Witkoff, and a top ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev, and discussed with only a few top senior Ukrainian officials. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Russian state media that the ministry had not received any information from the U.S. through official channels related to agreements on Ukraine. Likewise, Ukraine’s top supporters in Congress appeared to be in the dark. “I don’t know what this 28-point plan is. I’m glad that we’re coming up with a plan,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a top Trump ally and hawkish supporter of Kyiv, said during an event Wednesday morning hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But Graham added that any plan must be buoyed by strong U.S. military commitments to Ukraine and measures targeting Putin’s ability to fund the war. Some lawmakers were left to learn the details of the 28-point peace plan largely from reporting in Axios, which broke the story, and the Financial Times, which followed up with details of the plan. According to these reporters, the plan would have Ukraine give up full control of the eastern territory of the Donbas to Russia, even as Ukraine maintains control of about 12 percent of the territory with a heavily fortified front line, and requires Ukraine to cut the size of its armed forces by half. “I just heard about it but have not seen any of the details,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) told reporters Wednesday. “I have not been read in on the details of that,” said Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation. Rep. Don Bacon, the outgoing Republican congressman from Nebraska, criticized the administration for reportedly negotiating with the Russians without the Ukrainians and appearing to pressure Kyiv. “This sounds like 1938 Munich,” Bacon posted on social platform X, referring to the agreement that is largely criticized as appeasing Nazi Germany with territory at the time and emboldening Adolf Hitler to try to conquer Europe. Other reported details of the plan include limits on Ukraine’s arsenal of weapons and limiting U.S. military assistance. The Financial Times also reported that the plan bars foreign troops from Ukrainian soil — essentially vetoing ideas for a European or international peacekeeping force to monitor any ceasefire, or potentially blocking Ukrainian partnerships with foreign militaries. Also, Kyiv would no longer receive Western long-range weapons that can strike deep into Russia. The Financial Times continued that the plan says Russian should be recognized as an official state language in Ukraine and that it should grant official status to the local branch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Kyiv accuses the church of being an arm of the Kremlin’s propaganda, supporting the war in Ukraine. Many of the points are nonstarters for Kyiv, which has agreed to Trump’s calls for a ceasefire on existing battle lines but rejected demands to cede territory, warning it would only open the rest of the country to future Russian aggression. Russia is apparently hoping its military advances and a corruption scandal related to Ukraine’s energy sector weaken the negotiating position of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. “The irony: exposed Zelensky team corruption makes peace in Ukraine much more likely,” Dmitriev posted Tuesday on X. The renewed push for a peace plan comes after Trump last month called off a second face-to-face summit with Putin set to be held in Budapest because he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio determined the Russian side was not yet serious about ending the war. The plan’s reported details were met with concern among Ukraine’s staunch supporters in the U.S. and viewed as particularly cynical following a deadly strike by Russia on the Ukrainian city of Ternopil, killing at least 25 people, including three children. “As Ukraine mourns innocent people murdered in their sleep by a russian terrorist missile, the media reports that the US Administration has shared with Ukraine a new, updated Capitulation Plan,” Olena Halushka, co-founder of the International Center for Ukrainian Victory, a coalition of Ukrainian civil society leaders and think tanks, posted on X. “No pressure on russia, just Ukraine cutting its own hands and legs. What a disgrace.” Mykola Murskyj, director of the Razom advocacy team, a U.S.-based nonprofit that advocates U.S. support for Ukraine, said in a statement, “Any durable peace requires a militarily strong Ukraine and firm guarantees that Russia will be unable to reignite its war in the future.” “Americans around the country want to see Russia forced to end its war and return the Ukrainians it holds hostage, including tens of thousands of Ukrainian children. Nothing about Ukraine can be decided without Ukraine and its people,” he continued. Meanwhile, Graham is hoping to seize on the peace plan to add momentum to his push to pass a bipartisan bill targeting countries that do business with Russia and aid its war coffers. “No plan will work unless Putin and his allies believe that we’re serious about more military aid, more capability of Ukraine to hurt Russia militarily, and more economic ruin coming to those who prop up Putin’s war machine,” Graham said. “When they believe those things then the 28-point plan will work.” Trump seemed to give a green light last week for Congress to move ahead on Graham’s Russia sanctions bill, called the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025. It is co-sponsored by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) with a veto-proof majority of co-sponsors. But the pathway to passage is still unclear. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has called for the House to take up the bill first, because the bill includes tariff measures, and to provide a vehicle for it to pass in the Senate. “We want to get it done, yeah. Now, I think it’s probably a revenue measure, most likely originates in the House,” Thune told reporters Wednesday. “But as long as the White House is good with doing it, as you know, we’ve been ready to go on that for a long time. So hopefully the answer is yes, but we have a lot of stuff on the calendar.” House Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) office referred questions on the Russia sanctions legislation to committees with jurisdiction, but some lawmakers are calling for a vote on the floor immediately. “The House must immediately vote on the sanctions bill,” Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), posted Wednesday afternoon on X. Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.",centre
"Trump’s Tariff Windfall Should Go to Parents President Trump has floated the idea of sending $2,000 checks to most Americans, funded by tariff revenue. The idea is to show Americans very directly how much the country is benefiting from the billions being paid in import duties. But a lump sum payment of $2,000 is not the best use of tariff revenue. Injecting a massive stimulus regardless of need risks fanning the flames of inflation. It’s likely that the Federal Reserve would seek to offset any boost in spending enabled by the check with higher interest rates. resident Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office on Oct. 16, 2025, in Washington, DC. (Francis Chung/Politico/Bloomberg via Getty Images)A better use of tariff revenue would be to dramatically expand the Child Tax Credit—delivered as quarterly payments rather than a year-end refund. This would provide meaningful, sustained support to families raising the next generation while avoiding the inflationary risks of universal cash payments. The math is straightforward. Tariffs are bringing in roughly $240 billion annually. The current Child Tax Credit costs about $120 billion per year and provides $2,000 per child. Instead of scattering money indiscriminately, we could use approximately $160 billion of that tariff revenue to restructure the credit this way: - $3,000 for the first child, - $4,000 for the second child, - $6,000 for the third child, - and $8,000 for the fourth and each additional child. The additional amounts above the current $2,000 baseline would be non-refundable—available only to families with tax liability. The idea is to provide tax relief rather than create another welfare program. Poorer families without tax liabilities would still get the existing refundable credit. Turning Tariff Revenue into a Pro-Family Tax Cut Consider what this means in practice. A family with three children currently receives $6,000 annually through the CTC. Under this expansion, they’d receive $13,000, an additional $7,000. Delivered quarterly, that’s $3,250 every three months. For a family with four children, the total rises to $21,000, or $5,250 per quarter. These aren’t trivial amounts. They represent meaningful support for families facing the actual costs of raising children: childcare that runs $10,000-$15,000 per child annually in many areas, rising food and clothing costs, educational expenses, and the countless other outlays that come with each additional child. Compare this to the proposed $2,000 universal checks. A family with four children would get $2,000 once. Under this alternative, they’d get $21,000 spread over the year. Which would actually help them manage the ongoing expenses of raising their family? The quarterly delivery mechanism matters. Rather than a one-time payment that hits the economy all at once—potentially driving up prices—quarterly payments align with the rhythm of family expenses. Parents need support in June for summer activities and in September for back-to-school costs, not just in April when they file their taxes. Spreading payments over time also reduces inflationary pressure by avoiding a sudden spike in aggregate demand. There’s a deeper logic to this structure. By making the additional amounts non-refundable and removing phase-outs at high income levels, this proposal targets families who are both paying substantial federal income taxes and raising multiple children. These are precisely the families that get squeezed hardest under current policy. Current policy claims to value family formation but does almost nothing to support it where it matters most. The existing Child Tax Credit phases out starting at $400,000 for married couples—not exactly a fortune when you’re raising multiple children in an expensive area. This expansion would remove those phase-outs, providing meaningful support to families regardless of income level, as long as they’re paying taxes. The contrast with universal checks is stark. Universal payments encourage consumption, which might make sense when the economy is slumping due to inadequate demand. It doesn’t make sense when the economy is growing rapidly and inflation remains stubbornly high. Family tax relief rewards investment in the future. Every child represents not just 18 years of expenses, but a future worker, taxpayer, and contributor to economic growth. If the goal of tariff policy is to rebuild American productive capacity, using the revenue to support American family formation is entirely consistent with that objective. This is also a better policy design than universal checks from an economic perspective. One-time payments tend to fuel spending surges as recipients treat them as windfalls. Research on previous stimulus programs shows that consumers spend a larger share of one-time payments than they do of regular income. Quarterly family payments, by contrast, are more likely to be incorporated into household budgets and used for necessary expenses rather than discretionary splurges. The political advantages are significant too. It’s more defensible to fiscal conservatives because it’s structured as tax relief for families with tax liability, not an expansion of the welfare state. And it gives Republicans something concrete on family values beyond rhetoric about the importance of marriage and children. The current debate over what to do with tariff revenue reveals a broader confusion about policy goals. It’s admirable to want to show Americans more directly the benefits of tariffs. But just doing that is short-sighted. We should aim higher by supporting American families and encouraging marriage, having children, and raising the next generation. Trump has made American renewal a central theme of his presidency. But renewal requires more than just reshoring factories and renegotiating trade deals. It requires families willing and able to have children. That won’t happen if policy continues to squeeze families with substantial tax burdens while offering minimal support for the enormous expenses of raising multiple children. The $2,000 checks would make headlines for a week and then be forgotten. Quarterly payments that actually help families manage the costs of raising children would be policy that matters. If we’re going to use tariff revenue for tax relief, let’s use it in a way that advances actual policy goals rather than just generating a news cycle.

"As the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing the limits of the executive branch’s authority on tariffs, it is important to consider the tradeoffs that come with free trade. In American political and business circles, free trade has long been the favored mantra. Investors, executives, and most politicians speak of it with near-religious conviction. According to Google Trends, Americans have searched for “free trade” roughly twice as often as for “fair trade” since 2004. Mentions of fair or reciprocal trade, by contrast, are far rarer—though Donald Trump managed to raise their profile over the past decade. This imbalance in attention is not just a matter of economic theory. It reflects the political arithmetic that makes free trade a perennial favorite and fair trade a hard sell in Washington. This arithmetic follows an old Chinese proverb: “It is better to break one finger than to injure ten” (伤其十指，不如断其一指). But doing this can land the American economy in a ditch. Politicians rarely lose votes backing free trade, because the numbers—of voters, donors, and dollars—tilt decisively in its favor. On the one hand, tariffs are the inevitable instrument of fair trade. They help domestic producers compete, reopen shuttered plants, and revive manufacturing towns. They also allow middle-aged steelworkers, for example, to keep well-paying jobs rather than take minimum-wage ones. But tariffs come with visible costs on the other hand. Importers pay first, then try—often unsuccessfully—to pass them along to consumers. Exporters and original equipment manufacturers absorb another share to keep their business. Eventually, the burden ripples through currencies, supply chains, and countries. As such, tariffs are not exactly a tax on consumers in the conventional sense, even though consumers may and frequently do end up paying higher prices. As a result, politicians follow the Chinese proverb instinctively: higher tariffs hurt many consumers a little, but help a few workers a lot. Lower tariffs, meanwhile, help many consumers a little, but hurt a few workers a lot. Faced with a choice between slightly annoying millions or devastating thousands, politicians will choose the latter. They’d rather break one finger than to injure ten. And so, free trade wins. There’s more. Advocating free trade is not only politically safer—it’s more lucrative. Campaign donations tend to flow from the beneficiaries of global capital mobility, not from the victims of industrial decline. Free trade in America, of course, does not mean reciprocal trade. Foreign firms often enjoy wide access to U.S. markets, while American companies face high barriers abroad. This asymmetry gives foreign producers a structural advantage. They can exploit scale economies, invest more heavily in innovation, and recruit global talent—all while American firms face shrinking market share. Imagine a pharmaceutical company in New Jersey with a patented drug. If it produces in the U.S., it can sell domestically—but faces steep tariffs abroad. If it produces, say in China, however, it can sell both in China and in the U.S. tariff-free. The “giant sucking sound” Ross Perot once warned about is the sound of capital following profits—away from American workers and communities. As JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon recently lamented, “It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100% of our penicillin to come from China, and all of our rare earths, and all of our advanced chipmaking tools. We need to get our act together.” Yet the arithmetic of modern politics stands in the way. Capital is mobile; labor is not. Free trade enriches many investors by a small margin but impoverishes some workers by a large one. Fair or reciprocal trade, conversely, would slightly reduce returns for many investors to substantially improve conditions for a few workers. Given that political campaigns depend on money more than on gratitude, it’s easy to see which side wins. The irony is that by repeatedly “breaking one finger to save ten,” we may end up with none. Each individual decision to favor capital over labor, imports over production, or global supply chains over domestic resilience may seem compelling and rational in isolation. But cumulatively, they hollow out the national hand that once built and held the global economy. To “get our act together,” policymakers must change the arithmetic itself. Sometimes, it is wiser to “injure ten fingers a little” than to break one entirely. The business community can help by following the lead of companies like Apple—who has pledged to invested $600 billion in four years as part of its new American Manufacturing Program—and JP Morgan Chase—who is committing to facilitating and financing $1.5 trillion in the next decade to support U.S. economic security and resilience. Efforts like these allow the system to heal and keep all ten fingers intact. It’s time policymakers, business communities, and even consumers do the right thing and give fair trade a chance, even if it means we all must make some small sacrifices.

"Six months ago, CEOs of the world’s largest companies were preparing for turbulence. In an April survey by Fortune and Deloitte, 58% of global chief executives described their 12‑month economic outlook as pessimistic—half were simply cautious, while 8% were very pessimistic. Their gloom stemmed from fears over sweeping tariffs and tightening global financial conditions. Today, however, that sentiment has shifted dramatically. In the latest October survey, only 32% of CEOs now describe themselves as pessimistic about the global economy over the next year. Most say their concerns have eased, noting that tariffs have not disrupted global trade as feared. While few CEOs are celebrating just yet, the overall mood has improved. Their focus has shifted to managing a still-volatile but increasingly stable global landscape, where AI-driven innovation is taking center stage. The numbers to know 32% … of CEOs have a “pessimistic” (30%) or “very pessimistic” (2%) outlook for the global economy over the next 12 months. 26 … the percentage-point decline in pessimism since CEOs were last asked the same question in April 2025—at the height of the financial markets’ so-called “tariff tantrum.” 21% … of CEOs have a “pessimistic” (18%) or “very pessimistic” (3%) outlook for their industry performance over the next 12 months. 2% … of CEOs have a “pessimistic” (2%) or “very pessimistic” (0%) outlook for their company performance over the next 12 months. 37% … of CEOs say they think newly imposed tariffs will have a negative impact on their business. Another 51% say the impact will be neutral—meaning tariffs will bring a roughly equal mix of benefits and risks—while 10% say the tariffs will have a positive impact on their business. 80% … of CEOs say they are likely (38%) or very likely (42%) to implement cost-cutting measures over the next 12 months to offset higher costs related to current economic and trade policy uncertainties. 60% … of CEOs say AI will have a significant (45%) or transformational (15%) impact on their core processes over the next one to three years. The big picture After months of volatility and tariff worries, CEOs are starting to breathe easier. The Fortune and Deloitte survey finds leaders far less pessimistic about the global economy than they were in April. Many are now channeling energy toward cost discipline and AI-driven innovation rather than crisis management. It’s a shift from panic to pragmatism in the C-suite. A few deeper takeaways… CEOs are less bearish on the global economy than they were this spring Earlier this year, CEO sentiment took a sharp turn south amid what many dubbed the “tariff tantrum.” As trade tensions flared and questions mounted about how new import duties might ripple through global supply chains, 58% of CEOs told Fortune in April that they were pessimistic about the world economy’s outlook over the next 12 months. Six months later, that mood has eased. In the October survey, just 32% of CEOs described their outlook as pessimistic—a notable drop, though still above the lows seen in late 2024, when only 18% felt bearish. The shift suggests that while global growth remains uneven and risks persist, executives are adapting to the policy landscape and see less chance of a near-term downturn. The rebound in confidence comes as inflation pressures have remained in check and the Federal Reserve has resumed cutting short-term rates. Still, optimism is far from universal. Several respondents said ongoing geopolitical tensions, supply chain realignments, and policy uncertainty continue to cloud their long-term planning. In short, the panic of spring has given way to a more measured realism—CEOs aren’t panicked or exuberant, but they remain a bit cautious. CEOs see tariffs as a drag on the U.S. economy—but less so on their own companies Most CEOs think newly imposed tariffs will hurt the broader economy, even if their own firms can adapt. In Fortune’s October 2025 survey, 78% said tariffs will have a negative or somewhat negative impact on the U.S. economy. Yet when asked about their own company, more than half (51%) said the impact will be neutral, and only around one-third (38%) expect a negative or somewhat negative impact on their own company. That disconnect suggests CEOs may be either overestimating the drag on the macroeconomy—or underestimating how those same pressures could eventually reach their bottom line. In short, CEOs see tariffs as bad for business—just not necessarily for their business. CEOs plan to cut costs before passing them to customers With trade and economic uncertainty still lingering, most CEOs say their first move won’t be to raise prices—it’ll be to rein in expenses. According to Fortune’s October 2025 CEO survey, a combined 80% of respondents said they are likely or very likely to implement cost-cutting measures over the next 12 months to offset rising trade and policy-related costs. By comparison, about 64% said they plan to raise prices on goods or services, while only 43% expect to absorb those higher costs, even temporarily. The data suggest CEOs are preparing for a period of tighter margins and unpredictable input costs, but are still wary of testing customers’ tolerance for price hikes too quickly. CEOs say AI is already reshaping their core operations CEOs were most likely to cite core processes and resource allocation as areas seeing the deepest transformation. Around 60% of respondents said AI will have a significant or transformational effect on their core processes over the next one to three years. AI’s influence is also extending into long-term vision, growth strategy, and competitive positioning, where roughly half of CEOs reported at least a moderate level of impact. Methodology Fortune surveyed CEOs in collaboration with Deloitte between Oct. 3–16. A total of 69 responded to the survey, which was sent to the Fortune CEO Community. That includes chief executives from Fortune 500 and Global 500 companies as well as those attending Fortune conferences.",right
"Steel industry says Carney is moving in the right direction, but needs to pick up the pace Sector undergoing fundamental restructuring as market shifts away from United States and its tariffs Prime Minister Mark Carney is not moving as fast or as far on changing steel policies as industry players want, but they generally concede he is slowly taking major steps to transform the sector. His latest proposals will slash steel imports from free-trade-partner countries for the first time, further reduce steel imports from non-free-trade countries, cut imports of steel derivative products — essentially raw steel that has been minimally transformed — subsidize the cost of shipping steel across the country and step up border enforcement to ensure compliance. Taken together, the steps are what steel producers want, but haven’t come as quickly or reached as far as they’d like. “He is plodding along, as opposed to giving much faster relief,” Butch Mandel, chief executive and founder of Concord, Ont.-based Welded Tube of Canada Corp., said. “I suspect he’s going to get close, if not all the way, to what we’re asking, so why wait?” He said he found the pace of change highly “frustrating,” but he doesn’t fault Carney, given the challenges he faces, which include an unpredictable trade war that has left Canada’s steel sector highly exposed to downturn. The Canadian Steel Producers Association (CSPA) has been open about wanting a federal policy that slashes steel imports to 20 per cent of 2024 levels. “The ask of the industry was straightforward and it has not relented,” Mandel said. “We just said take everyone down to 20 per cent.” Carney on Wednesday tightened steel import quotas to restrict non-free-trade countries to importing no more than 20 per cent of the volumes they imported in 2024. Above that volume, they will encounter a 50 per cent tariff. For the first time, he also placed significant restrictions on steel imports from free-trade partners, which includes countries such as South Korea and Vietnam, reducing their shipments to 75 per cent of their import volume in 2024 before hitting a 50 per cent tariff. The policy excludes the U.S. and Mexico. The moves come after months of lobbying and still don’t reach the 20 per cent line on all countries, but it’s a policy that tightens controls on imports. “I’ve always looked at this stuff stepwise … and I consider this a very big step,” Catherine Cobden, chief executive of the CSPA, said. “We’ll take stock of things and come back to ask for adjustments if it’s not working.” For now, she said she was very happy to see policies that will open up new domestic demand. Carney also announced a global 25 per cent tariff on steel-derivative products from all countries, which won praise from Rita Rahmati, a spokesperson for the Canadian Institute of Steel Construction, a lobby group for steel fabricators and other companies that add value to raw steel. She said her organization had asked for such a policy months ago. Previously, by adding a screw or doing minor work to steel, foreign companies could avoid Canadian tariff quotas on steel. The new policy should plug “the loopholes,” she said. But it’s only a 25 per cent tariff and the industry might want a higher duty rate. “We’re at the point right now where we’re just pleased to have that,” Rahmati said. “We‘re not going to complain and say we’d like it to be higher.” Still, it’s clear the steel industry is undergoing a fundamental restructuring. Colin Mang, an economist at McMaster University in Hamilton, described it as a “reinvention” of the Canadian steel industry from a “north-to-south” focus to a new “east-to-west” focus. Historically, Canada has exported significant quantities of steel to the U.S. since there are major population centres with industrial demand just south of Quebec and Ontario, where Canada’s major mills are located. Now, producers must look to markets such as British Columbia to offset losses in the U.S., where tariffs are making their products less competitive. Cobden was in Victoria on Wednesday to meet with industry executives about how to accomplish this when Carney unveiled his latest steel policies, one of which aims to work with Canada’s two major railways to cut rail rates by half for domestically produced steel. “It’s definitely a huge benefit to the industry, all the stuff the government announced this week, and it’s good for the long-term vision of increasing internal trade,” he said. “We’ve talked about that for 130 years, and it’s really only in the past year that we’ve actually gotten around to taking the issue seriously.” There’s already a huge reshuffling of the steel industry underway, he said. Steel exports have fallen about 28 per cent while imports have fallen by 24 per cent. Chinese steel shipments to Canada have fallen to six per cent in 2025 from about 7.4 per cent of the total in 2024. The U.S. remains a major source of steel imports, but its role is declining. Through the first 11 months of 2025, Canada imported 1.4 million tonnes from the U.S., compared to 2.2 million in all of 2025, Mang said. Some other hard-hit industries, such as lumber, may be able to export their products to markets other than the U.S. But he said there aren’t any other likely export markets for steel other than the U.S. for a variety of reasons. “The Canadian steel industry will need to reorganize itself to focus primarily on serving the needs of the Canadian market,” he said. “The sooner they make that transition, the better.” Carney has been clear that he is taking a slow, safe approach. In private talks with industry members, he has said he doesn’t want to disrupt the economy by hastily slapping on tariffs that will be difficult to collect and could cause shortages of certain parts for businesses, according to a source who described one such discussion. “You don’t do it overnight because people have certain relationships, certain contracts,” Carney said when asked at a press conference on Wednesday why one of his policies won’t take effect until the end of January. “But you also don’t do it a year from now, or else it doesn’t have any benefit for the Canadian industry.” The policy in question are “remissions” that allow Canadians to import some steel products from the U.S. on a duty-free basis. Despite lobbying from steel producers to not allow remissions on U.S. steel at all, Carney issued yet another extension, but called it the final one. “I keep coming back to it; he’s saying things that no Canadian steel producer could argue with,” Mandel said. “The problem is he’s not going as far as I think he could go.” • Email: gfriedman@postmedia.com Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Shopify merchants not weighed down much by trade war, company says As retailers head into their busiest shopping season, they and their customers don’t appear to be feeling too bogged down by U.S. tariffs that have coloured much of the year. That’s according to executives at Shopify Inc., one of the world’s most prominent makers of e-commerce software. “When we look at the trade routes, when we look at the percentage of inbound versus outbound in the U.S., when we look at what we’re seeing on de minimis, we’ve not seen any significant impacts on our merchants,” chief financial officer Jeff Hoffmeister said on a Tuesday call with analysts. Economists have been closely watching the retail industry since Donald Trump kicked off his U.S. presidency by putting Canada and several other nations in his crosshairs at the start of the year. While he hasn’t made good on all of his threats, products like steel, aluminum, lumber and some auto parts crossing the Canada-U.S. border have all been slapped with higher duties. The de minimis exemption, a longtime U.S. trade rule that has allowed goods valued under US$800 to skip the duties, has also ended. Some feared the moves would result in a massive upheaval for businesses, but Hoffmeister said so far, Shopify’s merchants are “adapting quickly.” While many responded to April tariff announcements by raising prices, it’s been a less popular strategy lately. “The level of pricing increases is, in fact, slightly lower than the trends we were seeing last quarter,” Hoffmeister said. His remarks came as Shopify reported a blockbuster third quarter with a profit of US$264 million and 32 per cent jump in revenue, when the results are compared with a year ago. The company, which keeps its books in U.S. dollars, said its profit amounted to 20 cents US per diluted share for the period ended Sept. 30 compared with a profit of US$828 million or 64 cents US a year ago. On an adjusted basis, Shopify said it earned 34 cents US per share in its latest quarter compared with an adjusted profit of 36 cents US per share a year ago. Revenue for the quarter totalled US$2.84 billion, up from US$2.16 billion in the same quarter last year. Shopify president Harley Finkelstein, who joined Hoffmeister on the analyst call, saw the result as a sign that Shopify “can balance both growth and profitability.” “While we’re continuously evolving, the story of our results remains incredibly consistent,” he said. Some of Shopify’s growth can be attributed to artificial intelligence. It’s been increasingly embedding the technology in its software to ease some of the burdens merchants face and is pushing staff to use it to make them more effective. With AI now becoming so “reflexive” and its automation driving so many productivity gains, Hoffmeister said the company has been able to “redeploy talent to the highest-impact work.” Thus, Shopify’s head count has consistently been flat to down, both sequentially and year-over-year, and its operating expenses have dropped from 45 per cent in 2023 to 37 per cent this year. Another driver of Shopify’s growth has been its ability to cater to so many industries. While Hoffmeister listed apparel, accessories, health, food and beverage, beauty, home, and garden as strong performers in Shopify’s third quarter, it is also seeing rapid growth in other areas, where it’s won business away from larger enterprise platforms. For example, Shopify’s pet supplies vertical grew by more than 50 per cent, and arts and entertainment were up 45 per cent. “All roads lead to Shopify,” Finkelstein said. “Whether it’s food or manufacturing or education or even automotive, these are verticals traditionally, we didn’t go after and now, we’re winning them.” The success has showed up in numbers like Shopify’s merchant solutions revenue. It amounted to US$2.15 billion, up from US$1.55 billion a year ago, while subscription solutions revenue totalled US$699 million, up from US$610 million in the same quarter last year. Looking forward to the upcoming holiday season, Shopify said it expects its fourth-quarter revenue to grow at a percentage rate in the mid-to-high twenties on a year-over-year basis. The numbers will reflect a shift Finkelstein has seen in Black Friday and Cyber Monday. “It used to be a few peak sales days, but now it stretches across the whole quarter and it’s more global than ever,” he said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 4, 2025. Companies in this story: (TSX:SHOP) Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"“It’ll happen slowly, and then all at once.” That’s how Jim Morrow, founder and chief investment officer of Callodine Capital, describes the eventual – inevitable – unwinding of what he calls “the most crowded trade in history.” Of course, he isn’t just paraphrasing Ernest Hemingway—he’s talking about the AI race, and the trillion-dollar deals so overstretched they’re better described as knots than trades. And he’s not alone in sounding alarms. Michael Burry—the investor of Big Short fame who famously predicted the 2008 housing collapse—broke a two-year silence this week to say nearly the same thing: that Big Tech’s AI-era profits are built on “one of the most common frauds in the modern era”—stretching the depreciation schedule (some, including Burry, would say cheating the depreciation schedule). And it landed with extra weight: earlier this week, Burry quietly deregistered his investing firm, Scion Asset Management, effectively stepping away from managing outside money or filing public disclosures. Some analysts interpreted the move as less of an ominous sign and more, as Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, told CNBC, stepping away “from a game he believes is fundamentally rigged.” “On to much better things,” Burry hinted on X, with a new launch expected on November 25. Freed from the obligations of reporting and client management, Burry returned to X with a message that cut straight through the current AI euphoria. To him, the boom in GPUs, data centers, and trillion-dollar AI bets isn’t evidence of unstoppable growth; it’s evidence of a financial cycle that looks increasingly distorted, increasingly crowded, and increasingly fragile. Burry put numbers to it. In a post on X, the investor estimated that Big Tech will understate depreciation by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028, inflating reported profits by 26.9% at Oracle and 20.8% at Meta, to name two of his specific targets. Meta did not respond to a request for comment. Oracle declined to comment. “He’s spot on,” Morrow tells Fortune. Morrow has been making the arguments for months, warning that a “tsunami of depreciation” could quietly flatten Big Tech’s AI profits. Behind the trillion-dollar boom in chips, data centers, and model training, he argues, lies a simple but powerful illusion: companies have quietly changed the length of time they account for their machines—and their semiconductor chips—wearing out and depreciating. “Companies are very aware of it,” Morrow claims. “They’ve gone to great lengths to change their accounting and depreciation schedules to get ahead of it—to effectively avoid all this capex hitting their income statements.” Burry’s post drew viral attention. Morrow’s been making the case longer, but he thinks the sudden resonance means investors are finally waking up to something fundamental. “These aren’t small numbers—they’re huge. And the fact that someone like Burry is calling it out tells you people are starting to notice what’s happening between the lines of the balance sheet.” The great depreciation stretch Here’s how depreciation works—or doesn’t. When tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Oracle build AI data centers, they buy tens of billions of dollars in GPUs, servers, and cooling systems. Normally, those assets lose value fast, cutting into profits. But recently, Burry claims, many companies quietly extended how long they claim those machines last—from roughly three years to as many as six. That simple change lets them spread out their costs and report fatter earnings now. “Had they not made those changes,” Morrow says, “their earnings would be dramatically lower.” Meta’s filings, for one, seem to at least corroborate the directionality of Burry’s and Morrow’s claim. Until 2024, servers and network gear were depreciated over four to five years; effective January 2025, Meta said they would “extend the estimated useful lives” of “certain servers and network assets” to 5.5 years. “Depreciation expense on property and equipment,” Meta wrote in its annual filing for 2022, was “$8.50 billion, $7.56 billion, and $6.39 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.” In other words: depreciation was a major cost already, and management clearly chose to stretch the timeline over which those costs are recognized. The policy change doesn’t prove Burry’s dollar totals across firms, but it markedly moves reported earnings in the direction he describes by lowering near-term depreciation expense and pushing more of it into later years. Morrow argues that the timing makes little sense. As the pace of technological change accelerates—Nvidia now releases new chips every 12 to 18 months instead of every two years—the hardware becomes obsolete faster, not slower. It’s like any old technology. Take laptops: imagine trying to run the newest version of Adobe Premiere Pro on a 2018 MacBook. Sure, it might boot up, but it’s going to overheat, lag, or crash, because it simply wasn’t built for today’s compute demands. Old chips are the same way: they don’t stop working, but they quickly lose their economic value as newer, faster models render them functionally obsolete, Morrow argues. To be sure, Morrow’s expertise is in value investing and high dividend companies, as opposed to the trendier, high-growth tech stocks: in fact, he said he has no long positions in technology broadly. So, he benefits if Big Tech multiples compress or if the markets begin to reprice the costs buried in AI spending. Still, his critique aligns with growing unease from other analysts. Richard Jarc, an analyst at Uncovered Alpha, has raised similar alarms about the mismatch between AI chip lifecycles and corporate accounting. He has said that the latest generation of GPUs wears out far faster than companies’ amortization schedules suggest. While some point to the continued use of Nvidia’s H100 chips—released three years ago—as evidence of longer utility, Jarc says that’s misleading. Demand remains high largely because a handful of companies are subsidizing compute costs for end users, a dynamic that depends on investor cash flow rather than fundamentals, Jarc argues. More importantly, Nvidia has now shifted from releasing new chips every 18–24 months to an annual cadence. In that context, Jarc said, treating GPUs as if they’ll remain valuable for five or six years is unrealistic: their true economic life, he estimates, is closer to one or two. The Economist in Sept. called the delayed depreciation “the $4 trillion accounting puzzle at the heart of the AI cloud,” noting that Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle have each extended the useful life of their servers even as Nvidia shortens its chip cycle to one year. By The Economist’s estimates, if those assets were depreciated over three years instead of the longer timelines companies now assume, annual pre-tax profits would fall by $26 billion, roughly an 8% hit. A two-year schedule would double that loss, and if depreciation truly matched Nvidia’s pace, the implied market value hit could reach $4 trillion. Not everyone buys the doom loop. In a note to clients sent this week, Bank of America’s semiconductor team argued that the market’s sudden skepticism about AI capex is evidence that the trade is far less overcrowded than credits claim. The recent selloff in megacap AI names, the team led by Vivek Arya wrote, was driven by “correctable macro factors”—shutdown jitters, weak jobs data, tariff confusion, even misinterpreted OpenAI comments—rather than any real deterioration in AI demand. In fact, the firm pointed to surging ancillary segments like memory and optical (up 14% last week), as well as Nvidia’s disclosure of $500 billion-plus in 2025–26 data-center orders, as signs the underlying spending cycle remains “robust.” Growth or just capital intensity? But Morrow is most worried that investors are mistaking raw spending for real growth. The market, he argues, have stopped distinguishing between capital intensity and genuine productivity. The AI boom has pushed valuations from the realm of software multiples into something closer to industrial-scale infrastructure math. Building just one hyperscale, one-gigawatt data center—enough to support a cutting-edge AI model—can run around $50 billion, with the majority devoted to GPUs, followed by the buildings, cooling systems, and power infrastructure. Reality check—“none of these companies has ever managed a $50 billion project before,” he says. “Now they’re trying to do fifty of them at once.” The irony, he adds, is that many of those facilities can’t even run yet. Data centers across Santa Clara and Northern Virginia are sitting idle, waiting for grid hookups that could take years. “Every month a $35 billion stack of GPUs sits without power, that’s a billion dollars of depreciation just burning a hole in the balance sheet,” he says. “So of course they’re panicking — and ordering their own turbines.” He thinks the result will be a massive power glut by the late 2020s: an overbuilt grid, over-leveraged utilities, and ratepayers stuck with the bill. “We’ve seen this movie before—in shale, in fiber, in railroads,” he says. “Every capital-spending boom ends the same way: overcapacity, low returns, and a bailout.” The biggest risk, he says, is that investors have stopped looking at balance sheets entirely. He points to the sheer concentration of today’s market: nearly half of all 401(k) money now effectively tied to six megacaps. “This is the most crowded trade in history,” he says. “When it turns, it’s going to turn fast.”",right

The Trump administration’s 50 per cent tariffs on foreign steel “have fundamentally altered the competitive landscape and sharply limited our ability to access the U.S. market,” spokesperson Laura Devoni said in the statement. Algoma’s stock fell 6.4 per cent at 3 p.m. in New York. Algoma’s sales dropped 13 per cent in the third quarter and it reported a direct tariff expense of $89.7 million in that period, saying the U.S. steel market had become “largely closed to us.” The company, which currently has about 2,500 employees, was given $500 million in emergency loans from the governments of Canada and Ontario. The layoffs come into effect on March 23. “This transition is necessary to protect Algoma’s future in the face of these extraordinary and external market forces, and we will continue to advocate for a competitive and fair trading environment for Canadian steel,” Algoma said. Industry Minister Melanie Joly said Monday in Parliament that the government will continue working with the Algoma employees affected by the “unjustified and unjustifiable tariffs imposed by the White House” and vowed support for the steelmaker as it develops new products and accesses new markets.

"Steel: 50%. Copper: 50%. Cars: up to 25%. But an even bigger Trump-era levy looms: 107 % on Italian pasta. Mamma mia. It started with the U.S. Commerce Department launching what it says was a routine antidumping review, based on allegations Italian pasta makers sold product into the US at below-market prices and undercut local competitors. That has led to a threat of 92% duties, which would come on top of the 15% tariff President Donald Trump’s administration imposed on European exports generally. The news sent shockwaves through Italy, where 13 producers would be subject to the whopping one-two punch. They say sales in their second biggest export market would shrivel if prices to American consumers more than double. And while the measure would hardly prompt pasta shortages, it still has perplexed importers like Sal Auriemma, whose shop in Philadelphia’s Italian market, Claudio Specialty Food, has been operating for over 60 years. “Pasta is a pretty small sector to pick on. I mean, there’s a lot bigger things to pick on,” said Auriemma, pointing to luxury items as an alternative. But pasta? “It’s basic food,” he said. “Something’s got to be sacred.” Pasta adds heft to Italy’s economy Italy is a nation of avid pasta eaters. Less known is that most of the tortellini, spaghetti and rigatoni its factories churn out gets sent abroad. The U.S. accounts for about 15% of its €4 billion ($4.65 billion) in exports, making it Italy’s largest market after Germany, data from farmers’ association Coldiretti show. The punitive pasta premium has become a cause célèbre for Italy’s politicians, executives and economists. Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida told lawmakers in mid-October that the government was working with the European Commission and engaging in diplomatic efforts, while supporting the companies’ legal actions to oppose U.S. sanctions. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic addressed reporters in Rome last month, stressing the lack of evidence backing the U.S. decision and calling the combined 107% levy “unacceptable.” Margherita Mastromauro, president of the pasta makers sector of Unione Italiana Food, told The Associated Press that prices for Italian pasta in the U.S. remain high, and certainly higher than American-made rivals — undermining any dumping claim. She said that the measures could deal a fatal blow to small- and medium-sized producers. Lucio Miranda, president of consultancy group Export USA, agreed. “A duty rate of 107% would definitely kill this flow of export,” Miranda, who is Italian, said by phone from New York. “It’s not going to be something that you can just dump on the consumer and move on, life continues. It will definitely be a deal killer.” Wacky Mac owner cries foul The Commerce Department’s investigation started in 2024 after complaints from Missouri-based 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, which owns pasta brand Ronzoni, and Illinois-based Winland Foods, whose multiple brands include Prince, Mueller’s and Wacky Mac. The office’s review focused on La Molisana and Garofalo, chosen as primary respondents because they are Italy’s two largest exporters, the Commerce Department said in an emailed statement. Any sale price below either producers’ costs or the price they charge in the Italian market would be considered dumping, in line with numerous other reviews of Italian pasta since 1996, it said. The two companies presented information incorrectly or withheld it, significantly impeding analysis, according to the Commerce Department. And in the face of these alleged deficiencies, the office presented its 92% duty estimate, which it extended to 11 other companies based on an assumption the two companies’ behavior was representative. “After they screwed up their initial responses, the Commerce Department explained to them what the problems were and asked them to fix those problems; they didn’t,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in an emailed response to the AP’s questions. “And then Commerce communicated the requirements again, and they didn’t answer for a third time.” La Molisana declined to comment when contacted by the AP. Garofalo didn’t respond to a request for comment. The sanctions would be applied not just to imports going forward, but also the 12 months through June 2024, according to the Commerce Department. It added that only 16% of total Italian pasta imports may be affected. Its final decision is scheduled for Jan. 2, which could be extended by 60 days. ‘Completely senseless’ A little over an hour’s drive northeast from Naples is Benevento, a sleepy hilltop town of 55,000 people famed for its ancient Roman theater and Aglianico red wine. It’s also home to Pasta Rummo, founded in 1846, which prides itself on its seven-phase, “slow work” production method. CEO Cosimo Rummo is outraged by the threat to his company’s annual 20 million euros in exports to the U.S. “These tariffs are completely senseless,” Rummo said in a phone interview. “These are fast-moving consumer goods … Who would ever buy a pack of pasta that costs 10 dollars, the same price as a bottle of wine?” He added that he has no intention to start producing pasta stateside, as some companies have done and so would be spared the prospective levy. That includes Barilla, which for decades has been the main Italian pasta brand in the U.S. and now has large-scale production facilities there. An unsavory prospect When the transatlantic imbroglio started simmering, Robert Tramonte of Arlington, Virginia sought assurances. The owner of The Italian Store called his supplier, who told him there’s enough pasta inventory stocked in the warehouse to keep prices steady until Easter. Tramonte’s clients count on him for top-shelf product and he was relieved that, at least for the time being, they won’t have to shell out for the real deal. Or worse — perish the thought! — purchase made-in-America pasta. “They’ve tried to make Italian products and use the same ingredients, but the source wasn’t Italy,” he said. “And they just didn’t taste the same.”",right
"Posthaste: Cracks are appearing around the edges of Canada's credit world Delinquencies are rising at the nation's medium-sized banks, says Morningstar DBRS Canadians have come out of the pandemic borrowing binge remarkably well, weathering a steep climb in interest rates, an unsteady economy and rising unemployment. Though the Bank of Canada has reduced its rate to 2.25 per cent, it still remains higher than it has been for the past 15 years, outside of the pandemic. Nor has the wave of mortgage renewals off pandemic lows yet reached its peak. CIBC Capital Markets expects that in the second half of next year the share of borrowers facing payment shocks of more than 40 per cent will hit 5 to 6 per cent of the mortgage portfolio, more than double the share in 2025. Yet so far there has been no signs of trouble in insolvency rates, which have stabilized at levels seen before the pandemic. It’s at the margins of the credit world that observers are beginning to notice the strain. In a report this month Morningstar DBRS warned that mortgage delinquencies are rising at Canada’s medium-sized banks. These smaller banks, which offer an alternative to borrowers unable to get a loan at one of Canada’s Big Six, held $67.6 billion in residential mortgages as of June, 2025. DBRS said still high interest rates and rising unemployment have contributed to the credit deterioration and tariff uncertainty has amplified those pressures, particularly in Ontario and British Columbia, where housing prices have fallen the most. Of the rated mid-sized banks, Fairstone Bank of Canada and subsidiary Home Trust Company, and Equitable Bank are showing the most strain, while Laurentian Bank of Canada has shown resiliency, said DBRS. According to their calculations, Fairstone’s mortgage impairment ratio hit 2.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2025, up from 0.3 per cent at the end of 2022 and Equitable’s rose to 1.1 per cent from 0.2 per cent. “Heading into 2026, we anticipate credit pressures to continue as mortgage rates are still high and tariff uncertainty persists, affecting overall market sentiment,” said DBRS. - Here's how Canada's pension system ranks against the rest of the world's - Why economists are cutting their forecasts for the Canadian dollar - Advertisement 1Story continues below Another report looking at the quality of Canadian household credit by CIBC deputy-chief economist Benjamin Tal also warns of pressures building at the margins. Early-stage delinquencies in below-prime mortgages are now well above pre-COVID levels, and there are signs that homeowners are struggling with non-mortgage debt such as credit cards and lines of credit. “This does not bode well for the mortgage portfolio, mainly in the second half of 2026 when we expect the impact of mortgage refinancing payment shocks to be much more visible, said Tal. The 90+ day delinquency rate of borrowers with no mortgage debt has also been rising and is now 0.2 per cent higher than before COVID. “Given where we are in the economic cycle, we doubt that that rate will start trending downward any time soon. In fact, the opposite is the case,” said Tal. Tal expects delinquency rates to rise in coming quarters, but further credit losses should be contained by unemployment hitting a peak and lenders taking pre-emptive action. Morningstar DBRS also said despite increased impairments, actual loan losses have remained manageable. “In our view, generally good underwriting practices, low uninsured LTVs (loan-to-value ratios), and adequate reserve levels provide a sufficient cushion in this challenging environment,” the report said.

Canada’s economy shrank in August, missing expectations, but an estimate of 0.1 per cent growth in September should keep us out of recession. With the second quarter in the red, contraction in the third would qualify as a technical recession. But now it looks like the economy, though weakened by U.S. tariffs, should eke out some gains. Though the August gross domestic product figures were disappointing, they are not likely enough to press the Bank of Canada back into action, say economists. After cutting its rate to 2.25 per cent last week, the central bank said it was probably done if the economy performed as it expected. Statistics Canada said Friday that GDP is on track to grow by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter.

"New Delhi: The commerce ministry has already started the work to frame detailed guidelines for the Rs 25,060 crore Export Promotion Mission (EPM) and it will start releasing them from this month, a top official said on Monday. The government on November 12 approved the EPM with an outlay of Rs 25,060 crore for six financial years, beginning 2025-26, a move which will help exporters deal with high tariffs imposed by the US. The mission will be implemented through two sub-schemes -- Niryat Protsahan (Rs 10,401 crore) and Niryat Disha (Rs 14,659 crore). ""On export promotion mission, we are already working on these. Many sub-committees are in place which are looking at the detailed guidelines of each of these components. ""We will start releasing them within this month itself. If not all, we will have major portion of these guidelines coming out by the end of this month,"" Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal told reporters here. Under the mission, priority support will be extended to sectors impacted by recent global tariff escalations, such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, and marine products. These sectors are facing challenges in the US market. Due to the high import duties, India's merchandise exports to the US declined 8.58 per cent to USD 6.3 billion in October. The US has imposed a hefty 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods from August 27. Meanwhile, the two countries are negotiating a bilateral trade agreement. Through this mission, the secretary said that the government is trying to address all aspects of trade finance for exporters. The commerce ministry has said that the mission marks a strategic shift from multiple fragmented schemes to a single, outcome-based, and adaptive mechanism that can respond swiftly to global trade challenges and evolving exporter needs. Under Niryat Protsahan, it said, focus will be given to improve access to affordable trade finance for MSMEs through a range of instruments such as interest subvention, export factoring, collateral guarantees, credit cards for e-commerce exporters, and credit enhancement support for diversification into new markets. Similarly, under Niryat Disha, the funds will be used for non-financial enablers such as assistance for international branding, packaging, and participation in trade fairs, export warehousing and logistics, inland transport reimbursements, and trade intelligence and capacity-building initiatives. It is expected to facilitate access to affordable trade finance for MSMEs, enhance export readiness through compliance and certification support, and improve market access and visibility for Indian products.

"President Trump’s recent proposal to pay Americans “at least $2,000 a person” from new tariff revenue—a policy he calls “tariff dividends”—is facing sharp criticism from a budget watchdog, who calculates that the plan will actually lose twice as much money for the country as the tariffs are generating. Writing in a weekend post on Truth Social, Trump argued that tariff revenues could be redistributed directly to individuals in the form of annual payments, with “high income people” excluded from the payouts. The idea, pitched as a way both to reward taxpayers and possibly reduce the national debt, bears a strong resemblance to the structure of the COVID-era Economic Impact Payments, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). But the numbers reveal a steep fiscal challenge. The CRFB estimates that distributing just a single round of $2,000 payments to Americans—calculated to match the COVID payments, which included both adults and children—would cost the federal government around $600 billion per year. By contrast, the tariffs that Trump has championed have raised about $100 billion to date and, even accounting for pending legal cases, are only projected to raise about $300 billion annually going forward. Deficits could skyrocket “If tariff dividends are paid annually, deficits would increase by $6 trillion over ten years,” the CRFB writes, “roughly twice as much as President Trump’s tariffs are estimated to raise over the same time period.” This means not only that the revenue from tariffs would fail to cover dividend payouts, but also that the policy would exacerbate America’s long-term fiscal challenges. To put the numbers in perspective, if dividends were paid out on a “revenue neutral” basis—matching payouts to actual tariff revenue—the analysis estimates that payments could be made only every other year, starting in early 2027. Should the Supreme Court uphold current lower court rulings that have deemed some of Trump’s tariffs illegal, remaining tariffs would only cover the dividend payments once every seven years. Debt implications Beyond blowing past the revenue generated, diverting all tariff proceeds to pay these dividends would restrict the government’s ability to use tariff income for reducing deficits or paying down debt, as some administration officials have proposed. The CRFB warns that using all tariff revenue for rebates would push federal debt to 127% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2035, compared to 120% under current law. If $2,000 dividends were paid annually, that figure could jump further, reaching 134% of GDP over the same period. Such projections come at a time when annual budget deficits are nearing $2 trillion and national debt is quickly approaching an all-time high, making fiscal discipline a top concern for watchdogs and policy analysts. Trump’s proposal draws inspiration from pandemic-era Economic Impact Payments (EIPs), but those measures were carefully income-tested to phase out payments for individuals earning over $75,000 and joint filers over $150,000. The CRFB said its analysis used similar eligibility parameters for its cost estimate, suggesting that without strict limits, the fiscal hit could be even higher.

"Reversals of fortune are nothing new for Bitcoin diehards — euphoric rallies, then brutal selloffs. They happen every few years, or whenever sentiment snaps. None of those previous episodes, though, have prepared traders for the speed and scale of the past few weeks, in a reversal that was sharper than expected even if it lacked the systemic stress of prior crashes. Friday’s drop sent Bitcoin to a low near $80,500, putting it on track for its worst month since Terra’s $60 billion collapse in 2022 set off the bankruptcies that ended in FTX. Altogether, some half a trillion dollars in Bitcoin value has been wiped out. And that’s before tallying the carnage across the altcoin complex. Bitcoin is still comfortably up since President Donald Trump’s November victory, but much of the heady run has vanished in his first year back in office, the very stretch he hailed as crypto’s golden age. Most of the losses remain on paper. But for the first time since exchange-traded funds helped bring Wall Street and retail into the market, those positions are under pressure. The spark this time around is harder to spot. These new ETFs didn’t exist during the last big crypto crash. Investors have pulled billions from the 12 Bitcoin-linked funds this month, Bloomberg data show, with past buyers including Harvard’s endowment and several hedge funds. The slew of digital-asset treasury companies — publicly traded crypto holding vehicles, inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. — have seen even steeper outflows as investors question the value of corporate shells built solely to hold tokens. What’s clear is that crypto has become much bigger than the retail traders and techno futurists who are committed to HODLing through thick and thin. Now it has become woven into the fabric of Wall Street and the broader public markets, bringing a whole new set of finicky players to the table. “What’s happened these last two months was like rocket fuel, as if people were expecting this to crash,” said Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at Copper Technologies Ltd. “That’s what institutional investors do. They’re not there to hold, they don’t have that mentality. They rebalance their portfolio.” Bitcoin remains up roughly 50% from its pre-election low. And the scale of this pullback still pales next to its 75% collapse during the 2021–2022 bear market. That hints at how much deeper the pain could still go. Back then, each leg down exposed another major player — from Celsius to BlockFi to Three Arrows. Flash Crash But with no obvious blowups or scandals this time, some traders think the current drop is more about technicals and confidence than systemic cracks. “We aren’t following the same path down; overall macro conditions, government support, and fewer bad actors in the space make today’s market more resilient,” said Luke Youngblood, founder of lending platform Moonwell. “The foundations crypto is building on are stronger, even if there are causes for concern down the line.” The clearest catalyst was a flash crash on Oct. 10 in which $19 billion of crypto bets were liquidated in a matter of hours. The event exposed the chronic lack of liquidity during weekend trading — the flipside to crypto’s famed 24-7 trading schedule — as well as a build-up of excessive leverage on certain exchanges, knocking Bitcoin from the all-time high of $126,251 that it had reached just days earlier. “To some extent, we believe a lot of the decline in crypto markets is due to what happened on 10/10,” Brett Knoblauch and Gareth Gacetta, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., wrote in a Thursday note. “It feels as if some big players in the space are being forced to sell, as what happened on 10/10 might have had a far-larger impact on balance sheets than initially thought.” The problem hasn’t quite died out yet either. Liquidity in crypto markets remains low, with market makers weakened by the crash unable to step in and support prices. Around $1.6 billion in bets were liquidated across exchanges on Friday, according to Coinglass data, as the latest drop hit leveraged traders. Bitcoin’s gold-like mystique — always a big stretch — has faded. Gold has held its ground. Crypto remains a proxy for fast-twitch risk appetite — and it’s reacting faster than the market around it. This week, Bitcoin got caught up in topsy-turvy trading in technology stocks, with the token’s volatility being pointed to as both the cause and effect of equities turmoil. On Thursday, for example, the S&P 500 rose early in the day, bolstered by strong earnings from Nvidia Corp., before suffering its biggest intraday reversal since the April tariff turmoil. Analysts at Nomura blamed crypto, among other causes. Bill Ackman floated an unusual link — suggesting Fannie and Freddie holdings were behaving like a crypto proxy. Crypto’s fate is now tied to AI-fueled market optimism. With bubble chatter building, it won’t take much to spook investors into selling. There are also plenty of dangers lurking within the crypto ecosystem. The Saylor copycats have been built on the belief that a public company that does nothing but hold crypto can be worth more than the value of the tokens it holds. The push to repurpose public firms into crypto treasuries has endured to this point in the downturn — echoing the overleveraged lenders of 2022. If confidence cracks, forced selling could follow. Many are already underwater on their token holdings. “When you’ve got a medical device company or a cancer research firm rebranding as a crypto treasury, it’s a sign of where you are in the cycle,” said Adam Morgan McCarthy, senior research analyst at blockchain data firm Kaiko. Overall, any positive vibes left in the industry appear to be hurtling toward rock bottom. The Fear and Greed index — a tool that measures sentiment in crypto markets — sat at a score of 11 out of 100 on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap. That’s deep in “extreme fear” territory. “Fear sentiment has spiked to relative highs while structural demand for spot remains notably absent, leaving the market without the natural buyers typically present during significant corrections,” said Chris Newhouse, director of research at Ergonia, a firm specializing in decentralized finance.",right
"EXCLUSIVE: While Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman weighs a gubernatorial bid, Gov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., is reportedly considering a corporate tax hike – a move the New York Republican described to Fox News Digital as a ""tax on the middle class."" Blakeman said a decision about his political future is coming ""very soon"" as he travels across New York state to determine if he has the ""support to get to the next level."" But as Blakeman mulls his political future, he is sounding the alarm on Hochul for reportedly planning to raise taxes on corporations to shore up funds for the state's budget gap and to deliver on Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's socialist campaign agenda, according to Politico. ""This is a tax on the middle class,"" Blakeman told Fox News Digital. ""It will make things less affordable. It will drive up inflation, and it will make New York less competitive. Corporations are already leaving our state in record numbers. Jobs are leaving our state. People are leaving our state. This corporate tax increase will drive more high net-worth individuals and corporations out of New York State and will be an economic disaster."" NEW YORK LEADER PLEDGES MORE COPS, TOUGHER ICE PARTNERSHIP IF NYC ELECTS SOCIALIST MAYOR Kyle Strober, executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, the region's leading economic development advocacy organization, told Fox News Digital that a corporate tax increase could be ""potentially devastating"" to Long Island's economy. STEFANIK DECRIES HOCHUL AS 'WORST GOVERNOR IN AMERICA' IN FIERY 2026 CAMPAIGN LAUNCH ""Long Island, whose economy is closely aligned with New York City, is already confronting multiple challenges, including high taxes, high costs of living, and a lack of housing driving potential employees and employers outside the region,"" Strober said, adding that a corporate tax hike would ""only serve to drive away additional businesses and high-income earners, who pay the majority of the state’s tax revenue."" ""When this occurs, the tax burden is shifted to Long Island’s hard working middle class. It becomes self-evident that this tax proposal would fly in direct conflict of making New York more affordable for our middle class, a stated goal of Albany leadership,"" he explained. The ABLI led efforts in 2021 and 2025 to oppose tax hike proposals out of Albany, particularly tax hikes on the top 1% of New Yorkers and raising the corporate tax rate. Hochul has faced pressure from the socialist wing of the Democratic Party to raise taxes so Mamdani can deliver on his ambitious campaign promises, including fast and free buses, universal childcare and city-run grocery stores. Mamdani campaigned on raising taxes on the top 1% of New Yorkers and hiking up the state's corporate tax from 7.25% to 11.5% to match the rate in New Jersey. Any tax hikes would require Hochul's approval in Albany. MAMDANI LAUGHS OFF CRITICISM THAT HIS TAX HIKE PROPOSALS WILL COMPEL NEW YORKERS TO FLEE While the comparably moderate governor endorsed Mamdani after he secured the Democratic nomination, Hochul has maintained that she won't raise taxes on the top 1% of New Yorkers – despite Mamdani's supporters heckling Hochul to ""Tax the rich!"" ""This has become a one-party state ruled by the far-left, woke, progressive part of the Democratic Party, now led by Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City, who is an avowed social democrat,"" Blakeman said, charging that Mamdani sounds like a ""communist."" ""He is anti-American values,"" Blakeman said. ""He is against business. He will destroy the economy of the greatest financial city in the world, the financial capital of the world: New York City. And that will have a material effect on my county, which borders New York City."" Blakeman said Hochul raising taxes on corporations would be a ""disaster."" And when asked how the state should approach Mamdani following his election night success, Blakeman said Republican leadership needs to step up and ""push back"" in New York state. ""When he wants to do crazy things, like give free bus rides to everybody, which will be nothing more than homeless shelters on wheels, when he doesn't want to prosecute criminals for committing crimes, when he wants to increase taxes and increase the corporate tax rate, and he wants the tax the rich, which will drive people out of New York State, and they'll take jobs with them, we have to push back."" While New York City handed power to its far-left flank on Election Day, neighboring Nassau County re-elected Blakeman, an ally of President Donald Trump. ""I won because I adhered to American values, American principles. I didn't raise taxes a penny in four years. I hired 600 new law enforcement professionals. I declared Nassau County wasn't a sanctuary county. I showed leadership and I reached out to communities that in the past, the Republican Party has ignored,"" Blakeman said, explaining how he built a broad coalition of support among diverse communities. When reached for comment, Hochul campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika told Fox News Digital that the governor has ""cut middle class taxes while putting inflation refund checks in New Yorkers’ pockets."" ""Bruce Blakeman is the number one fanboy for Trump’s tariffs that are raising costs for families and making everything more expensive for small businesses – while the governor remains laser-focused on lowering costs, Blakeman’s shilling for Donald Trump’s tariff tax hikes,"" Chitika charged. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Since winning his re-election earlier this month, Blakeman said business and political leaders have encouraged him to launch a campaign for governor, given his executive experience. But while rumors swirl about Blakeman's political future, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., another Trump loyalist, has already launched her gubernatorial campaign and secured support from New York Republican Party Chair Ed Cox and 36 New York conservative county chairs.",right

So far, tariffs imposed under Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) have brought in only about $90 billion through September 23, according to the US Customs and Border Protection. That amount is far below what a national stimulus check program would require.For comparison, a COVID-era plan to send $2,000 checks to families was estimated to cost $464 billion. Even limiting the payments to households earning under $100,000 would still cost about $300 billion, according to Erica York of the Tax Foundation. There are also concerns that if the Supreme Court rules against Trump’s use of IEEPA tariffs, the government might have to return some money to importers. Overall, the U.S. collected about $195.9 billion in tariffs during fiscal year 2025 through August 31. Bessent said the administration “inherited this affordability disaster” and the worst inflation in decades. He added that no final decision has been made on the structure of Trump’s stimulus proposal. Instead of direct checks, the “dividend” could be delivered as tax relief targeted at Americans earning under $100,000. ALSO READ: Jeffrey Epstein’s chilling email before suicide mentioned Trump? Here's what the disgraced financer wrote Economists warn that the federal budget may not be able to support cash payments. York estimates the new tariffs could raise nearly $217 billion by 2026 — still far short of the roughly $300 billion needed to provide $2,000 payments to the 123 million households earning below $100,000. Is there enough tariff revenue? The White House's proposal to use tariff revenues to fund a $2,000 dividend check for millions of low- and middle-income Americans has become the focus of economic and political debate. Although the measure has undeniable appeal to voters frustrated by the cost of living, economists and financial analysts warn that the logic behind this initiative is flawed, especially with regard to its financing and potential inflationary impact.Donald Trump's controversial proposal suggests a payment of at least $2,000 for most US citizens, funded by revenue generated from his tariff policies. The proposal must go through an approval process, but even before that, many experts say that it has no support or economic backing, as there is no budget to finance this proposal. ALSO READ: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS puzzles scientists again: Cosmic visitor's survival behind the Sun points to possible alien origin? Check details The biggest challenge to the proposal is basic math. Analysts estimate that sending $2,000 to about 150 million lower-income adults would cost roughly $300 billion. Customs revenue has grown — reaching nearly $195 billion in the last fiscal year — but the money raised from the new tariffs is far smaller, at around $120 billion so far. Economists say this makes it highly unlikely that the promised $2,000 checks could be paid for using tariff revenue alone.

"Starmer Girds for Six-Month Fight to Save His Premiership Keir Starmer has six months to prove his mettle to his party amid swirling doubts within the governing Labour Party that he can reverse plunging public confidence in his UK administration. (Bloomberg) — Keir Starmer has six months to prove his mettle to his party amid swirling doubts within the governing Labour Party that he can reverse plunging public confidence in his UK administration. The prime minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves survived a budget statement this week that did just about enough to avoid a reckoning with the markets and Labour Members of Parliament. But with voters turning their backs on Labour, at some point his party will decide whether to stick with him, or twist. Ministers and aides told Bloomberg that Starmer needs to convince his lawmakers and the public before local elections in May that “Starmerism” can be a vote winner. Speaking anonymously about party ructions, some close to the premier fear a move against him in the new year, before one potential challenger, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, has an opportunity to return to Parliament. What’s clear is Starmer can ill-afford his approach to continue to be what internal critics say is an incoherent mess, as typified by a chaotic run-up to the budget. As the year draws to a close, Labour MPs are asking themselves whether Starmer can stop the rot. Pollsters are doubtful. “It’s very unlikely, if history is anything to go by, that Starmer, Reeves and the government as it stands will be able to turn this around,” YouGov’s head of political data, Patrick English, told Bloomberg Radio on Friday. “The majority of voters will get the chance to vote in May and at the minute, as far as we can tell, they’re preparing to give the government a right good kicking.” Certainly the budget didn’t seem to please voters, with many left feeling forgotten. Polling in the aftermath suggest the British public has completely lost confidence in the Starmer-Reeves project. The Labour government which swept to power in a landslide election win just 16 months ago has so far pursued an awkward mash of competing ideas. There were big election promises to prioritize growth and investment that suggested Starmer might be the heir to former premier Tony Blair. He’s also poured a lot of energy into international affairs, with a focus on security and the war in Ukraine. This year, his government has toughened its messaging around migration and crime: an approach espoused by Starmer’s top aide, Morgan McSweeney, aimed at stopping the working class falling to populism. There’s also been some more typically Labour re-distributive social democracy, with taxes on the rich and higher public spending, as well as increased welfare spending forced in part on the government by rebellious Labour backbenchers who rejected attempts to curb spending on disability benefits and winter fuel payments to pensioners. Many inside Labour have asked which is the real Starmer. Some posited that Reeves’ budget, broadly seen as a tilt to the left, may be a sign of a permanent political shift from Downing Street to shore up his position. They may be disappointed. Those close to the premier say don’t expect him to pick a side. Starmer’s allies said bridging different ideas is the key to success for a progressive leader in a world dominated by President Donald Trump, and in a country with huge structural economic problems. Any leader who doesn’t push on all these fronts will fail, one argued. That approach featuring a long list of U-turns frustrates many within the party, who see it as lacking vision or direction. The run-up to the budget — including a retreat from plans to raise income tax — was described by government officials as hellish and shambolic, and compounded the sense ministers aren’t fully in control of the narrative. Reeves’ package itself left Blairites and some of those previously allied to McSweeney less enthused about a budget without a growth plan. That’s not without risk as Health Secretary Wes Streeting emerges as a leadership contender on Starmer’s right flank. It looks like the pre-election pitch to back growth and business is out of the window, though there will be a fresh push in these areas in the coming weeks, a government official said. Only a few weeks back, it was Burnham and the so-called soft-left sharpening their knives calling for a government with more Labour values. They won’t go away, especially if the May elections are brutal and Reeves comes after the welfare budget again. One Starmer ally said he isn’t lurching between different factions, he’s trying to work with them all. Another sought to highlight Starmer’s successes on the international scene, saying it was no small achievement to have helped hold Trump back from the brink of siding with Russian President Vladimir Putin in seeking a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. Nevertheless, Starmer’s inner circle knows things haven’t gone well domestically, and are seeking more robust arguments for what he is trying to do. The premier will make an unashamedly Labour case that paying more tax is worth it for better public services, an aide said. Starmer said on Thursday that the budget had “asked everybody to make a contribution” to protect public services and help people struggling with the cost of living. “I’m not going to apologize for lifting half a million children out of poverty,” he said. The premier also knows it is essential to reform welfare, spark more dynamism in the UK economy, and stop small boats crossing asylum-seekers across the English Channel. His problem is, each time the government pulls in any of these directions, it upsets a Labour faction. No. 10 aides despaired at the perennial criticism, asking who Starmer’s detractors think could do a better job at handling Trump and British populist leader Nigel Farage. Changing leader for either Streeting, Burnham or former deputy premier Angela Rayner would destroy Labour’s mandate and deliver Farage to power, they argued. The officials said there’s still time to turn things around before the next general election, due in mid-2029. But they also fretted that governing is becoming impossible in an age of hyper-cynicism, a total lack of patience and instability caused by international events such as the Ukraine conflict and Trump’s tariff war. Starmer’s inner circle still hopes that in 2026 the prime minister the country and party wants is the decent pragmatist who takes different ideas and tries to make the best of a bad hand. Their fear is that both Labour MPs and voters want something else. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion. Please keep comments relevant and respectful.

"Chicago Boycotts America While the Fed Gets Cooked by San Francisco and Pasta Welcome back to Friday! This is the Breitbart Business Digest weekly wrap, where we review the economic news of the past seven days while sipping on the delicious cocktail of economic vindication mixed with institutional humiliation. The Federal Reserve released research proving its own rate-holding decision was based on a theoretical mistake. Italian pasta makers are confirming that tariffs work through demand destruction, not price inflation. The government shutdown destroyed economic data we might have used to validate or debunk the Fed’s forecast. The Supreme Court is about to reshape central bank independence. And a Chicago politician is using taxpayers’ retirement funds as a campaign billboard while boycotting the safest investment on Earth. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference on September 18, 2024, in Washington, DC. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)I Left My Broken Economic Theory in San Francisco It’s been quite a week for people who believe the Federal Reserve should actually read its own research before making trillion-dollar decisions that affect everyone’s mortgage payments. Jerome Powell, the nation’s central banker, has spent the better part of 2025 explaining why the Fed couldn’t cut interest rates because—and we quote him directly from June—tariffs would “show up more” as “tariff inflation.” Researchers at the San Francisco Fed released a paper this month examining tariff policy from 1870 through 2020 across the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Their conclusion: when countries raise tariffs, inflation actually falls, not rises. A roughly four percentage point increase in average tariffs lowered inflation by about two percentage points while raising unemployment. This isn’t a close call. The pattern held across different time periods—before 1913, the interwar period, post-WWII. Higher tariffs correlated with lower prices and weaker economic activity. Not upward price pressure. Downward. Powell’s entire rationale for holding rates steady—protecting us fragile Americans against tariff-driven inflation—was built on what the Fed’s own research now shows was a foundational misunderstanding. Oopsies! Proof in the Pasta Aisle You want evidence that tariffs don’t raise consumer prices? Look at Italian pasta. Italian pasta makers are facing combined tariffs of 107 percent—92 percent from Commerce Department antidumping duties and 15 percent from Trump’s EU tariff. Rather than raise prices on boxes of rigatoni, they’re preparing to exit the U.S. market entirely. Giuseppe Ferro, CEO of La Molisana, put it bluntly: “No one has those kinds of margins.” In other words, the tariffs cannot be passed on to consumers, and even the importers are not absorbing them. The foreign producers are being forced to mangia the tariffs. By the way, do not blame Trump if your favorite pasta vanishes from the shelves. The huge tariffs the Italians are facing are not Trump’s EU tariff but anti-dumping tariffs imposed by an independent probe. In other words, they would have been applied by any administration. No Data Collection, No Data Reports As everyone knows, the government shutdown lasted six weeks and was the longest in history. Importantly, it lasted through the collection periods for October’s consumer price index and jobs reports. This wasn’t just a delay in releasing data that was already collected. The shutdown prevented the data from being collected at all. The Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys asking households about employment and spending during specific time windows. Apparently, they can’t retroactively ask someone in November about their labor market participation in October. The moment passes. The data vanishes like the Golden Gate Bridge on a foggy day. So, now we’re in the surreal position of having a Fed chair whose entire rate-holding decision was premised on tariff inflation fears—fears that the Fed’s own research just demolished—while missing the very economic data that might have validated or invalidated his forecast. October CPI might never exist. The October jobs report might vanish into the bureaucratic void. The Fed is, as Karoline Leavitt said, “flying blind at a critical period.” Which means Powell made a major monetary policy error based on faulty theory, and we might never get the actual data that would have shown it to him in time. Let Them Cook The Supreme Court this week scheduled arguments for January 21 on whether President Trump can remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Cook has been hanging on since late August, when Trump indicated he wanted her gone over mortgage fraud allegations that she denies. The Court scheduled the case for the last possible date of the January sitting, apparently feeling no sense of urgency about this battle that the media has frequently insisted is an existential crisis for the central bank. There may be more here than meets the eye. In December, the Supreme Court will hear a case that could overturn the 1935 Humphrey’s Executor ruling, which shields agency heads from at-will removal. If SCOTUS overturns that precedent (and recent cases suggest they’re inclined to), Cook’s removal becomes legally straightforward. So, the court may have scheduled Cook’s day in court to follow the death of Humphrey’s Executor. Chicago’s Treasurer Announces She’ll Boycott America Melissa Conyears-Ervin, Chicago’s treasurer, announced Wednesday that she’s ordering her office to boycott investing in U.S. Treasury securities — not as an investment strategy, but as a political protest against Donald Trump and what she called his “authoritarian regime.” This is the municipal finance version of an insurrection. Conyears-Ervin obviously hates Trump, which she is entitled to. But Trump doesn’t issue any Treasuries. Those are the debt of the U.S. government, backed by the full faith and credit of the American people. She’s not boycotting authoritarianism. She’s boycotting America. Here’s the thing: Chicago doesn’t currently hold any Treasury securities. The city held over $200 million in Treasuries within the past three years, but not now. So, she’s announcing a boycott of something the city isn’t doing. What is Chicago going to invest in if they will not buy America’s debt because their treasurer is mad at the man America elected president? Conyears-Ervin claims her office can safely earn comparable returns in alternatives like corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. In other words, to protest Trump’s misdeeds, she’s going long corporate America. American leftism is getting weirder and weirder. Oh, and guess what? She’s running for Congress. Because of course she is. The Founding Father of South America This Sunday, November 16, marks the 493rd anniversary of Spanish explorer Francisco Pizarro‘s encounter with the Inca Empire at Cajamarca—one of history’s most consequential collisions between civilizations. This triggered the Spanish colonization of most of South America, which in turn gave birth to the modern nation-states that exist today: Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Pizarro, in other words, is the founding father of South America. It’s the kind of historical milestone that used to warrant reflection on how the world changes, how power redistributes, how established orders crumble. These days, it’s the kind of anniversary polite society has decided not to celebrate. Have a good weekend. COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format Trump’s $2,000 Tariff-Funded Checks Spark Economic Debate Trump announced the idea on Truth Social, saying every eligible American would receive a “dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!)” funded by tariff revenues, as per a Newsweek report. The plan, however, has not been formally introduced as policy, and many questions remain about how it would work and whether it’s financially viable.Economists Warn Trump’s $2,000 Payments Could Fuel Inflation Several experts told Newsweek that Trump’s plan could push prices higher, as Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said, “Sending out checks to Americans is a recipe for higher inflation at a time when inflation is still stubbornly too high,” adding, “The president is pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, while he is also now pushing for higher spending—those two policies in combination would seriously threaten a return of higher inflation,” as quoted by Newsweek.ALSO READ: Big Short Michael Burry warns: Meta and Oracle may be hiding billions and fudging earnings by over 20% Economists Compare Trump’s Plan to Pandemic-Era Stimulus Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff agreed, saying the $2,000 payments would “of course” drive inflation up, similar to the effects of pandemic-era stimulus checks, as per the report. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed that such fiscal stimulus during COVID-19 increased annual inflation by about 2.6%, though it also helped avoid deeper economic trouble, reported Newsweek.Lessons From the 2021 American Rescue Plan on Inflation Risks Maurice Obstfeld, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said “The experience of the American Rescue Plan in 2021 shows that such rebates would be inflationary,” adding, “Already under pressure from higher prices of necessities, most households would spend rather than save the money, driving prices even higher,"" as quoted in the report.ALSO READ: Nvidia now worth more than Japan’s entire economy — just 30,000 employees vs 124 million people Can Tariff Revenues Really Fund Trump’s $2,000 Rebate Checks? Experts Doubt It Economists also questioned whether tariffs alone could pay for such large payments. The Treasury Department reported that customs duties brought in about $195 billion in the 2025 fiscal year, reported Newsweek.Obstfeld estimated that “Even if the $2,000 checks are awarded per household (not per person), and only to households earning less than $100,000 per year, the budgetary cost would be more than $200 billion,"" as quoted in the report. He added, “This sum is close to the revenue Trump’s tariffs will probably yield this year, and more than half of the cost of extending the Obamacare subsidies for 10 years,” and said, “The checks would contribute materially to a U.S. federal deficit that is already unsustainably large,” as quoted by Newsweek. FAQs What is Donald Trump’s $2,000 check proposal?It’s a plan to send $2,000 payments to lower- and middle-income Americans using money raised from tariffs. Who would qualify for Trump’s $2,000 checks? Trump said the payments would go to lower- and middle-income Americans, excluding high-income earners.

"American shoppers are expected to spend more during this holiday shopping season than last year despite economic uncertainty and rising prices. The 2025 forecast from the National Retail Federation on Thursday estimates that shoppers will collectively spend between $1.01 trillion and $1.02 trillion in November and December, an increase of 3.7% to 4.2% compared with last year. Retailers rung up $976 billion in holiday sales last year, the group said. “We’re seeing really positive behavior and engagement from consumers, ” NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay told reporters on a call Thursday. “In fairness, that’s been somewhat of a surprise.” But Shay said more Americans are growing selective and they’re focused on discounts. And while spending is expected to be up again, the growth of that spending may be in decline. That is still greater than the average increase of 3.6% between 2010 to 2019. Americans ramped up spending after that during the coronavirus pandemic. Holiday season sales rose 8.9% in 2020 and soared 12.5% in 2021, according to the NRF. The group’s holiday forecast is based on economic modeling using various key economic indicators including consumer spending, disposable personal income, employment, wages, inflation and previous monthly retail sales releases. NRF’s calculation excludes automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants to focus on core retail. Holiday spending accounts for 19% of annual sales for the retail industry, though for some retailers the number is a lot higher, according to the NRF. And consumer spending in the U.S. is monitored closely because it drives about 70% of the nation’s gross domestic product. The forecast this year, however, arrives during the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. There has been no government data released on the jobs market or retail sales since the shutdown began 37 days ago. “Forecasting is increasingly challenging in this environment,” Shay acknowledged. The NRF forecast is in line with other estimates, however, which point to slowing growth. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase last year. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31, compared with last year’s 4.2%. Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion this holiday season, representing 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year’s 8.7% growth. Consumer spending in the U.S. has remained resilient even as consumer confidence has eroded. Mark Matthews, NRF’s chief economist and executive director of research, said consumer behavior is changing with a sharper focus on finding deals. And the frequency of family nights out at a restaurant is on the decline, NRF executives said. The timing of the government shutdown is “absolutely problematic,” Matthews said, noting that it’s led to a loss in private sector income, which erodes consumer demand. Spending should recover once the shutdown ends, Matthews said, yet there are broader issues of concern that will not be solved when the government shutdown ends. The gap between wealthy and lower-income households is widening, according to analysts. Based on spending from its credit card and bank customers, Bank of America found that spending growth among lower income households rose 0.6% in September compared with the same period last year. Among higher income brackets, spending rose at more than four times that speed, or 2.6%, in September. And wages are growing faster for higher income households. That is making it more difficult for lower income households to keep up when tariffs and other economic factors are pushing prices higher. In a separate report this week, Bank of America estimated that U.S. consumers are bearing 50% to 70% of the U.S. tariff costs, and it expects that load to grow. “We think there is overwhelming evidence that tariffs have pushed inflation higher for consumers,’’ Bank of America economists Stephen Juneau and Aditya Bhave wrote. At the same time, U.S. companies have announced tens of thousands of job cuts. Some companies have cited rising operational costs from new tariffs under the Trump administration, as well as shifting consumer spending, corporate restructuring, or increased spending on artificial intelligence. That has led retailers to pull back on the hiring of seasonal workers.",right
"U.S. officials are privately saying that they might not levy long-promised semiconductor tariffs soon, potentially delaying a centerpiece of President Donald Trump's economic agenda. Officials relayed these messages over the last several days to stakeholders in government and private industry, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations. A fourth person following the matter also said the administration was taking a more cautious approach to avoid provoking China. The discussions have not been previously reported. Trump aides are taking their time on chip tariffs as they work to avoid a rupture with Beijing over trade issues, which would risk a return to a tit-for-tat trade war and disruption of the flow of critical rare earth minerals, according to two of the people. Those people cautioned that no decision is final until the administration signs off on it, and also said that triple-digit tariffs could be imposed at any time. The sources spoke anonymously in order to recount private conversations about policy deliberations. Trump said in August that the United States would impose a tariff of about 100% on imports of semiconductors but exempted companies that are manufacturing in the U.S. or have committed to do so. Privately, over the last several months, Washington officials had told people that the administration would roll out the tariffs soon. That guidance has now changed as the administration has continued to debate the timing and other details. A White House spokesman and a Commerce Department official, asked about the discussions, disputed that the administration had adjusted its posture. ""The Trump Administration remains committed to using every lever of executive power to reshore the manufacturing that's critical to our national and economic security,"" said the spokesman, Kush Desai. ""Any anonymously-sourced reports suggesting otherwise are simply Fake News."" The Commerce official said, ""There is no change in department policy regarding semiconductor 232 tariffs."" Neither specified how soon tariffs that have been threatened since the early days of the Trump administration would be finalized, nor did they offer any other details. The Chinese embassy in Washington said cooperation between the two countries on semiconductors is the best approach. ""We welcome the U.S. to work with China to implement the consensus reached at the Busan summit between the two heads of state, create a favorable environment for mutually beneficial cooperation between companies from both sides, and jointly maintain the stability of the global semiconductor supply chain,"" said the spokesperson, Liu Pengyu. TRUMP FACES PRESSURE ON CONSUMER PRICES Any decision by the administration to slow down or narrow the scope of chip tariffs would come at a sensitive time for Trump. The Republican president is facing growing consumer angst over prices heading into the holiday shopping season. Hiking taxes on imported semiconductors could raise consumer costs on the gadgets they power, from refrigerators to smartphones. Reuters reported in September that the Trump administration was looking at a plan that would also tax foreign electronic devices based on the number of chips in each one. Trump rolled back tariffs on more than 200 food products last week, but he has also said that his import taxes have made no significant contribution to inflation. The U.S. government shutdown has delayed recent data on consumer prices, but inflation has been running above the Federal Reserve's target since former President Joe Biden held office. Trump is also trying to maintain a delicate trade truce with China, a top manufacturer of both semiconductors and devices powered by them. Last month, Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, and reached an agreement to set aside their trade issues, for now. During those conversations in Korea, U.S. officials nonetheless warned their Chinese counterparts that they could take national security steps in the coming months that Beijing might find objectionable, according to two people familiar with those conversations. Trump has bet that tariffs can revive domestic factory jobs lost over decades to countries including China. In April, the Trump administration announced investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat.

"Costco Wholesale Corp. joined a fast-growing list of businesses suing the Trump administration to ensure eligibility for refunds if the US Supreme Court strikes down the president’s signature global tariffs policy. The nation’s biggest warehouse club chain is among dozens of companies to file lawsuits in a US trade court since late October challenging President Donald Trump’s use of an economic emergency powers law to impose the levies, according to court records. It’s one of the biggest corporate players to jump into a fight largely driven this year by small businesses and Democratic state officials. The Supreme Court heard arguments on Trump’s tariffs on Nov. 5. The justices put the fight on a fast-tracked schedule but didn’t say when they intend to rule. In the meantime, businesses of all sizes have brought cases pressing similar legal claims with the goal of avoiding uncertainty about their eligibility for refunds if the court rules against Trump. Read More: Tariff-Paying Firms Line Up in Court to Get Paid If Trump Loses Costco’s lawyers wrote that the complaint, filed on Nov. 28 in the US Court of International Trade, was prompted due to the uncertainty that refunds will be guaranteed for all businesses that have been paying duties if the Supreme Court declares the tariffs unlawful. The lawsuit doesn’t specify how much Trump’s tariffs have cost the company to date. Costco argues that it needs a court intervention immediately because Customs and Border Protection denied its request to extend the schedule for finalizing tariff determinations under Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The company says that could jeopardize its ability to seek full refunds in the future. Costco didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that, “The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump’s lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court’s speedy and proper resolution of this matter.” Skeptical Justices During arguments before the Supreme Court last month, key justices appeared skeptical of Trump’s tariffs, which have generated tens of billions of dollars a month. Lower federal courts ruled against the administration in a handful of lawsuits filed early on, but judges have allowed the government to enforce the tariffs until the Supreme Court issues its decision. Other household names to bring tariff lawsuits in recent weeks include cosmetics giant Revlon Consumer Products Corp. and motorcycle maker Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing Corp. The expansive, fast-changing tariff policies have disrupted the retail sector this year, threatening to raise prices of goods and hamper the purchasing power of US consumers who are already cautious following years of inflation. The impact has been more muted than expected due to exemptions and changes in rates after negotiations, though some items such as electronics and apparel are more expensive compared to a year ago. While retailers have warned that they continue to see higher costs, many big operators have not pursued lawsuits like Costco — making it an outlier. Read More: What’s at Stake as Trump’s Tariffs Face Supreme Court Costco has said it’s working to mitigate tariffs, which primarily affect its non-food items. It has rerouted some products to non-US markets, ordered more inventory early to get ahead of the levies and purchased from fewer suppliers by consolidating buying. When items get too expensive, it’s changing merchandising altogether. “We’re doing everything we can,” Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said in an interview with Bloomberg News earlier this year. “Whether that’s working with the suppliers to find efficiencies to offset the impact of tariffs, or whether it’s sourcing with them often to different countries.” For example, Costco said in May that it kept steady prices of pineapples and bananas imported from Central and South America because they are important items to customers. At the same time, it increased prices of flowers sourced from the region because they are less of a necessity to shoppers. The club chain said its big size and limited assortment — its stores carry a couple thousand items versus over 100,000 for some big-box retailers — give it a leg-up when navigating tariffs. Still, it’s difficult to predict what will happen to prices, company executives said. The case is Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Customs and Border Protection, 1:25-cv-316, US Court of International Trade.",right
"Good morning. Just three years ago, most companies treated generative AI like an uncertain curiosity. Today, it’s hard to find a Fortune 500 company that isn’t rethinking core processes to leverage it—momentum that’s only accelerating as 2026 approaches. Leaders are no longer debating whether generative AI will matter; they are racing to determine how to operationalize it. That shift was the topic of my conversation with Wharton marketing professor Stefano Puntoni, co-director of the Wharton Human-AI Research (WHAIR) initiative. Puntoni noted that generative AI adoption is progressing at an eye-opening pace. “I don’t think there’s any company that now says, ‘Generative AI isn’t for us,’” he said. The third annual WHAIR study, conducted with GBK Collective, underscores this acceleration, Puntoni told me. A survey of 800 senior leaders in finance, IT, HR, and other functions at U.S. companies with more than $50 million in annual revenue found that 88% expect to increase generative AI investment in the next year, and 62% expect budgets to rise by more than 10% within two to five years. This marks a sharp reversal from 2023, when concerns around data leakage, regulatory liability, and consumer protection—especially in heavily regulated industries—led many companies to ban generative AI outright, Puntoni explained. Today, most enterprises are moving ahead and figuring out optimal implementation with guardrails, he said. “I think it’s going to take a decade to really find out how to use this technology, but it’s improving so rapidly,” he added. Usage patterns show the shift. In 2023, only 37% of senior leaders used generative AI weekly. Now, 82% do, and 46% report daily use, according to the report. Because generative AI is a general-purpose technology, Puntoni and his colleagues expect usage to reach near-universal levels. “Half of senior leaders in a large sample of corporate America are saying that they’re using a tool every day; that is really quite incredible,” he said. Measuring progress Leaders appear optimistic about returns. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said their companies track ROI through metrics such as profitability, productivity, and throughput, according to the report. Four out of five expect positive returns within two to three years, with top executives more optimistic than mid-level managers. Still, progress varies by company size. Larger enterprises are seeing slower results as they manage complex integrations, while midsized and smaller firms report quicker progress. Tech, banking, and professional services firms are among the sectors making strides. The ROI reports rely on self-assessments rather than hard evidence, Puntoni said. Many organizations are still refining how they measure success, often focusing on intermediate metrics. “We should look at this data as more like a vibe of how they feel about it than hard evidence for what’s happening inside these companies,” he added. MIT’s August report found that, based on its dataset, most firms struggle to generate immediate ROI from generative AI—from a profitability perspective—with back-office automation delivering the biggest impact. However, both the MIT and WHAIR reports highlight a persistent barrier: workforce skill gaps. Wharton’s survey shows that 43% of leaders warn of “skill atrophy,” underscoring the need for better AI training programs. As generative AI matures in the enterprise, organizational readiness is paramount—leadership alignment, workforce skills, governance, and change management, not just technical capacity, according to the report. Enterprise AI is already a major focus on Wall Street, and investors are watching closely as big tech companies and their customers scale adoption. As we head into 2026, a clearer question is emerging: not whether generative AI will create value, but how companies can build the skills, systems, and governance to capture it.

"USTR Greer Talks Trade With Swiss as Swatch CEO Blasts Approach US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer held a video call with top Swiss officials following this week’s diplomatic mission to the White House from captains of Swiss industry, as the country looks to negotiate a reduction in the punishing 39% tariff the US has imposed on Switzerland. (Bloomberg) — US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer held a video call with top Swiss officials following this week’s diplomatic mission to the White House from captains of Swiss industry, as the country looks to negotiate a reduction in the punishing 39% tariff the US has imposed on Switzerland. Greer held the virtual meeting with his Swiss counterpart Helene Budliger Artieda and economy Minister Guy Parmelin, according to a Linkedin post by the Swiss government late on Friday. “Very constructive conversation with Ambassador Jamieson Greer on Trade and Investment,” the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs said in the post. “Great new dynamic in our bilateral relations, thanks to President Trump.” It features screenshots and photos of all three in discussion, and is followed by dozens of likes and messages of encouragement from Swiss executives. The virtual gathering follows the in-person meeting in the Oval Office earlier this week between the CEOs of top Swiss companies and President Donald Trump. Those present included Alfred Gantner, the founder of Partners Group Holding AG, Rolex SA boss Jean-Frederic Dufour, Daniel Jaeggi of commodity trader Mercuria Energy Group Ltd, Richemont SA Chairman Johann Rupert, Diego Aponte of shipping firm MSC and Marwan Shakarchi of MKS Pamp SA, a gold refiner. While Dufour and Rupert are both influential figures in the luxury goods industry, their rival Nick Hayek, the outspoken CEO of Swatch Group AG took a very different tack. “The only king I court is the customer,” Hayek told Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, perhaps in reference to the recent ‘No Kings’ protests against Trump’s presidency. Hayek, whose company is the world’s largest watchmaker, said the CEOs’ visit sent a signal of weakness. Instead, he suggested that Switzerland — the seventh-largest investor in the US — should retaliate by threatening to cut investment, or ditch a deal to buy US-made F-35 jets. “Are we William Tell,” he quipped in reference to the Swiss hero of folklore, “or are we a vassal?” Trump’s tariff announcement, delivered on Switzerland’s national holiday, landed Swiss exporters with a rate higher than any other developed nation. The levy, which took effect in August, threatens to drive up costs for chocolatiers including Lindt, watchmakers and precision-tool manufacturers. Budliger Artieda has made repeated trips to Washington in recent weeks in the hope of resolving the impasse. While demand for Swiss goods has, in some cases, withstood the impact of the tariffs, Bern has cut its growth forecast for next year, acknowledging the likelihood of economic damage.

"Trump administration says it has trade frameworks with Argentina, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said Thursday that it had reached trade frameworks with Argentina, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala. The frameworks are about increasing the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, according to a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity as a condition for briefing reporters on a call about the agreements. The White House also released statements on the frameworks, which have yet to be finalized and are expected to be signed within roughly two weeks. It’s all part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump to rewrite the rules of global commerce through the use of broad tariffs. President Javier Milei of Argentina hailed his country’s first bilateral trade framework with the U.S. in nearly a decade as “tremendous news.” “As you can see, we are strongly committed to making Argentina great again,” he said. The frameworks touch on an array of subjects, including efforts to reduce nontariff barriers and cut tariffs to 0% on American-made goods as well as commitments to not impose digital services taxes on U.S. companies. There would also be tariff relief on select products from these countries. For example, import licenses in these countries would be eliminated and streamlined, while nations would agree to resolve issues on intellectual property rights. Under the tariffs previously announced at the end of July by Trump, goods imported from Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemala are taxed at 10%, as the U.S. runs a trade surplus with each of those countries. Products from Ecuador, with which America runs a trade deficit, are taxed at 15%. Guatemala President Bernardo Arevalo called the framework “good news” and said his country would be in a position to attract new investments. He said that 70% of the products Guatemala exports to the U.S. will face zero tariffs under the framework, as exclusions are granted for goods the U.S. is unable to make. All other goods would still be subject to the 10% tariff. The U.S. senior administration official said that tariffs in these nations could be reduced on coffee, cocoa and bananas. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump have each suggested that the tariffs are being relaxed as affordability issues are a key concern for U.S. voters. ___ Perez D. reported from Guatemala City, Guatemala.

"US, South Korea Eye Joint Pact to Build Submarines for Both The US and South Korea are in private negotiations to jointly build nuclear-powered submarines for both navies, a potential major shift in their alliance that would go beyond the announcement made by the countries’ presidents two weeks ago, people familiar with the matter say. (Bloomberg) — The US and South Korea are in private negotiations to jointly build nuclear-powered submarines for both navies, a potential major shift in their alliance that would go beyond the announcement made by the countries’ presidents two weeks ago, people familiar with the matter say. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met in South Korea in late October and announced a pact to enable South Korea to build its own nuclear-powered submarines, with Trump saying they’d be built in Philadelphia. Since then, behind the scenes, a more sprawling vision has taken shape, the people said. A joint fact sheet on their overall trade, tariff and defense agreement published Thursday evening in Washington, and Friday morning in Seoul, touched on the building of nuclear submarines but gave no further details, an indication that many points remain unresolved. Officials from both countries are now considering a plan for Korean-led joint production, potentially across sites in both countries, of subs for both countries, according to the people. The scenario includes potentially beginning with US-class submarines, the designs for which are closely held secrets, before moving to South Korea’s own design, the people said. The talks stem in part from a private request of Trump’s own: When Korea sought the relevant permissions and nuclear capability to build its own subs, Trump privately said they should build a couple for the US, too, some of the people said. The US has been trying to speed up its submarine building. What form the deal will take remains deeply unclear, and talks could stall or collapse. The two sides are in early-stage negotiation over several core components, such as which subs will be built, where they’ll be built, for which country and in what sequence, the people said. In the fact sheet, the two sides celebrated joint efforts that “will increase the number of U.S. commercial ships and combat-ready U.S. military vessels as quickly as possible, including the potential construction of U.S. vessels in the ROK,” or Republic of Korea. It added: “The United States has given approval for the ROK to build nuclear-powered attack submarines. The United States will work closely with the ROK to advance requirements for this shipbuilding project, including avenues to source fuel.” The statement made no mention of Philadelphia. The statement stopped well short of detailing talks already underway. Any agreement between the US and South Korea would reshape the nations’ military alliance and could be similar to the Aukus deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. But the proposal is unprecedented in other ways, and would face significant questions, hurdles and headwinds to come to fruition. For the US president, the deal with Seoul is part of a grand bargain to lower certain tariff rates on Korean goods in exchange for a $350 billion investment fund that includes $150 billion in shipbuilding. Trump is angling to leverage Korean expertise in shipbuilding to revive the US sectors, from submarines to more mundane commercial vessels. “Having South Korea build submarines for the US Navy — based on a US or Korean design — would be unprecedented and carry significant risk,” said Adam Farrar, a Bloomberg Economics senior geoeconomics analyst for the Asia-Pacific. “Yet with US shipyards falling short of Navy needs, tapping allied shipbuilding expertise could help, if the towering legal, industrial and security hurdles can be cleared.” Earlier: US Races to Rebuild Submarine Power Before China Catches Up During a televised briefing on the fact sheet, Lee said Korea had continued to stand its ground in talks to finalize the overall trade and tariff pact since the Trump visit. “The US government maintained that the general framework had already been settled during the summit. But when it came to drafting the detailed text, they presented a wide range of differing opinions,” Lee said. “The lengthy process was unavoidable — it was the only way we could fully exercise the one power we had, which was to hold firm.” Still, the joint statement leaves several questions about the submarine plan swirling as talks continue. The Philly Shipyard, which is owned by Korean defense giant Hanwha, is not currently equipped to make nuclear-class submarines, though the company is preparing to build subs under any deal and has an internal target of producing 2-3 submarines within a decade, including potentially in Philadelphia, some of the people said. “Hanwha Philly Shipyard was a centerpiece yard in America’s storied naval shipbuilding past, and our commitment to it will chart the way toward America’s advanced shipbuilding future,” Hanwha Chief Strategy Officer Alex Wong said in a statement that did not directly touch on the US-South Korea talks. Trump is continuing to push for the US to receive two submarines and believes they should be provided for free, according to one of the people. Given that submarines can cost several billion dollars, it would be a steep ask. In a written statement on Thursday, Lee’s presidential office said that characterizing South Korea as pushing back against US demands or that the US had asked for two submarines for free was not a reflection of the state of discussions. South Korea has long sought nuclear-powered submarines and during his meeting with Trump, Lee asked Trump to provide fuel for them. South Korea says it needs low-enriched uranium — below 20% enrichment — from the US but, for that, the two nations would need to amend or find a way to reconcile their nuclear energy pact, which prohibits Seoul from using such fuel for military use. While Trump’s October announcement appeared to provide a green light for South Korea’s goal to possess nuclear submarines, Seoul wants to build them at home — and is seeking the technology to do so. The US is also looking to increase its own fleet, with construction of its foremost attack submarine, the Virginia-class, beset by cost overruns, delays, and labor shortages. The White House has declined to specify what class of submarine it wants built — leaving open the scenario that it might pressure the Koreans to build US-class subs like the Virginia class, at least in part, rather than their own design. But that goes against South Korea’s initial wishes for a smaller design. And the potential of that raises its own set of questions and potential controversies, including whether Virginia-class subs would be partially built in South Korea. The joint statement’s reference to “potential construction of U.S. vessels in the ROK” nodded to the possibility, though didn’t explicitly specify military vessels. “Even though Trump supposedly approved it, that doesn’t mean it will actually happen overnight,” said Kim Dong-yup, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies and retired South Korean Navy officer. “These things take years, even a decade to accomplish and there are countless legal and policy constraints in the US, including non-proliferation and secrecy restrictions. If Trump leaves office, it’s entirely possible that US agencies will step in and block the whole thing.” The White House declined comment other than to say in a statement, from spokeswoman Anna Kelly, that Trump is bolstering US maritime power “including by securing historic investments from the Republic of Korea to modernize and expand our shipbuilding capacity.” —With assistance from Alastair Gale.

"India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) on Tuesday raised India's GDP growth projection for the current fiscal to 7 per cent on the back of high growth in the June quarter and less impact of the US tariff hike on global growth and trade. Ind-Ra expects GDP in FY26 to grow 7 per cent year-on-year (YoY), 70 basis points higher than its earlier forecast of 6.3 per cent (projected in July 2025), the rating agency said in a statement. The RBI has projected India's GDP growth in the current fiscal year at 6.8 per cent, better than the 6.5 per cent expansion in the last fiscal year. India's real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at the fastest pace in five quarters at 7.8 per cent in the April to June period of FY26. The official data for Q2 (July-September) GDP growth estimates is scheduled to be released on November 28. Ind-Ra said both domestic and global landscapes have changed significantly since its last forecast in July 2025. Major headwinds are the uncertain global scenario due to the US unilateral tariff hikes for all countries, with the tariffs on India being one of the highest since the end of August 2025. The major tailwinds for the economy since the July forecast are faster-than-expected inflation decline, increasing the real wage rate, especially in rural areas and GST rationalisation, said Ind-Ra Chief Economist and Head Public Finance, Devendra Kumar Pant. The two major factors for the sharp upward revision in growth forecast are sharper-than-expected GDP growth in the June quarter and the impact of the US tariff hike on global growth and trade being lower than the estimated earlier. Ind-Ra, while forecasting the FY26 growth at 6.3 per cent in July, had assigned a key risk of tariff war and any capital outflow. Ind-Ra believes the risks to FY26 growth are evenly balanced. ""A faster Indo-US trade deal and favourable weather conditions during winter months have the potential to push GDP growth higher than 7 per cent. However, if the demand revival (consumption and investment) is weaker than expected, it could pull down GDP growth,"" the agency said. Ind-Ra expects private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) to grow 7.4 per cent YoY in FY26 (FY25: 7.2 per cent), driven by GST rationalisation and lower inflation. Ind-Ra said Indian exports to the US fell 11.9 per cent and 8.9 per cent YoY in September and October 2025, respectively. While exports averaged USD 7.2 billion per month in FY25, they averaged USD 7.4 billion from April to October 2025, but dropped to USD 5.9 billion during September-October 2025. ""Although exports to the US improved sequentially in October 2025, it is too early to call it a revival.

"The deal also includes a commitment by Swiss and Liechtenstein companies to invest $200 billion in the US, with $67 billion slated for 2026 alone, aiming to create thousands of American jobs and reduce the US trade deficit with Switzerland. The agreement, announced by US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer and Swiss officials, reflects the successful culmination of constructive negotiations to promote “Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade."" ALSO READ: Trump plots major tariff cuts to slash soaring grocery bills for millions of Americans Ambassador Greer highlighted the deal as a continuation of the ""America First Trade Policy"" that removes tariff and non-tariff barriers, expands market access for U.S. exports, and welcomes sizable Swiss investment into the US economy. Key features of the agreement include: - Reduction of US tariffs on Swiss and Liechtenstein goods to a maximum of 15%, aligning them with rates applied to the European Union, down from 39%, which had severely impacted Swiss exports. - Switzerland's commitment to removing tariffs on American industrial goods, while also opening up new duty-free quota systems for specific U.S. agricultural products such as beef, poultry, and bison. - Measures to simplify customs and labeling processes, making it easier for American goods like poultry, dairy, and medical devices to enter Swiss markets. - Robust agreements on intellectual property rights, digital trade principles including the avoidance of harmful digital services taxes, and enhanced cooperation on export controls, sanctions, and investment screening. - Swiss plans to invest $200 billion in the U.S. by 2028, with substantial new investments focused on pharmaceuticals, aerospace, and other key sectors. The US trade deficit with Switzerland and Liechtenstein stood at $38.3 billion in 2024, and this agreement is expected to pave the way for levelling that deficit by 2028 by fostering more balanced, reciprocal trade ties. This trade deal ends months of tariff tensions that began when the Trump administration imposed the 39% tariffs in 2025 as part of a broader strategy to address trade imbalances and alleged unfair trade practices by key partners. The agreement is seen as a mutually beneficial framework that strengthens economic ties, secures supply chain resilience, and supports job growth on both sides of the Atlantic through expanded market access and substantial new investments.

"U.S. manufacturing surveys released Monday showed welcome signs of easing inflationary pressures, with both major purchasing managers’ indexes reporting slower rates of price increases in October—a potentially encouraging signal for Federal Reserve policymakers as official government economic data remains unavailable due to the ongoing federal shutdown. The price moderation emerged as a rare point of agreement between two surveys that otherwise painted starkly different pictures of the manufacturing sector’s health. Inflation Cooling Despite Tariff Pressures The Institute for Supply Management’s Prices Paid Index fell to 58.0 in October from 61.9 in September, indicating input costs are still rising but at a significantly slower pace. Similarly, S&P Global reported that while input price inflation remained “historically elevated,” October marked the lowest rate since February. Both surveys attributed ongoing cost pressures primarily to tariffs, but the deceleration suggests some relief may be emerging in supply chains. With the federal government shutdown continuing, private sector surveys like the ISM and S&P Global PMI reports have taken on heightened significance for businesses, investors, and policymakers seeking real-time economic intelligence in the absence of official Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and other government data releases. Beyond the inflation picture, however, the two surveys diverged sharply on the overall state of U.S. manufacturing. The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7 from 49.1, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction (readings below 50 indicate declining activity). The index missed economist expectations of 49.3. “In October, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted at a faster rate, with contractions in production and inventories,” said Susan Spence, chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee. Production notably fell back into contraction after a brief improvement in September. Only two of the six largest manufacturing industries—food, beverage and tobacco products, and transportation equipment—expanded during the month. ISM reported that 58 percent of the manufacturing sector’s GDP contracted in October. The S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI registered 52.5, up from 52.0 in September, indicating a third consecutive month of expansion. The survey reported production increasing at a “solid pace” and new orders growing at their fastest rate in 20 months, driven primarily by domestic demand. New export orders declined in both surveys. S&P Global reported exports declined for a fourth consecutive month and to the greatest degree since July, with sales falling to key markets including Canada, China, Europe and Mexico. The survey explicitly attributed the decline to tariffs, stating “tariffs reportedly remained the primary driver behind the drop in exports.” S&P Global’s Chris Williamson noted that “tariff policies being increasingly blamed both on rising export losses and import supply chain disruptions.” Business confidence remained subdued in both surveys. S&P Global reported optimism falling to its lowest level since April, with “US trade policy uncertainties” cited as “a big factor in dampening business spirits.” ISM respondents also described challenges related to trade policy. “Business continues to remain difficult, as customers are canceling and reducing orders due to uncertainty in the global economic environment and regarding the ever-changing tariff landscape,” said one ISM respondent from the chemical products sector. The ISM report noted that tariffs and their impact on prices and demand “feature highly in respondents to the survey.” Both surveys showed weak labor market conditions in manufacturing, with ISM’s employment index at 46.0 (contraction) and S&P Global reporting only “modest” hiring growth for a third successive month. A closer examination of S&P Global’s survey reveals potential concerns beneath its expansion reading. The report documented an unprecedented surge in finished goods inventories—the steepest increase in over 18 years of survey history. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, called this “the most worrying” development in the report, noting it was “widely linked to weaker than anticipated sales to customers, especially in export markets, which could trigger a downshifting of production in the coming months unless demand revives.” Williamson added that “companies have also become less optimistic about the year ahead, with sentiment back down close to the gloomy levels seen around the April tariff announcements.” He noted particular weakness in consumer-focused industries: “Business confidence among producers of consumer goods is now down to its lowest for two years as firms growing increasingly worried about household spending in the US and falling sales to consumers in export markets.” This inventory buildup—where production exceeds sales—often presages future production cuts, potentially explaining why ISM’s data already shows production contracting. The Momentum Question ISM’s Spence noted that while there had been “a chain reaction of one-month index improvements” starting with new orders in August and flowing to production in September, “these short gains have not appeared to translate into sustained growth for the sector, a reflection of continuing economic uncertainty” The ISM data showed that October’s reading “corresponds to a change of plus 1.8 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis,” suggesting the manufacturing sector, while contracting, is not dragging down the broader economy, which requires a PMI reading below 42.3 to indicate overall economic contraction. The sharp divergence between the surveys reflects differences in sampling and methodology. S&P Global surveys approximately 600 manufacturing firms, while ISM polls over 400 companies. The different industry compositions, geographic distributions, and weighting methodologies may explain the conflicting signals. With inflationary pressures moderating but demand uncertainty persisting, manufacturers face a challenging environment navigating trade policy impacts, weakening exports, and economic uncertainty. The restoration of government economic data releases would provide additional clarity, but until then, these private surveys—despite their differences—offer the most timely glimpses into the manufacturing economy’s direction.

"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said New York City just shot itself in the foot by electing avowed democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani its next mayor, adding that the far left would have lost in both the Big Apple and New Jersey if an exodus wasn’t already under way. Fox News host Sean Hannity said at least 9% of New Yorkers plan to leave the city if Mamdani wins, adding that he personally hopes Mamdani loses — for the sake of friends who haven’t yet joined him in Florida after the city’s political decline. DeSantis suggested he will continue to welcome New Yorkers to Florida who want to keep any far-left politics back north. ""This is a guy, Mamdani, he wants to take down the Columbus statue. I have already said if they take that from Manhattan, we will take it in Florida,"" he said, adding he’d also accept the Statue of Liberty if it decided to leave and instead be erected in Lake Okeechobee. CUOMO CALLS NYC MAYORAL RIVAL 'DANGEROUS,' WARNS SOCIALISM WOULD BE 'DEATH KNELL' FOR CITY ""And I think it's an incredible act of ballistic podiatry, shooting yourself in the foot, by New York City voters. This is a guy who does embrace Marxist economics. He claims he's going to lower everyone's costs by having government-run grocery stores, and the only people that would think that would work are people who have never studied a lick of history,"" DeSantis said. Mamdani’s win was also followed by several fervent reactions from critics who noted that the socialist will be at the helm on the 25th anniversary of 9/11 – including Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., who posted a clip of a plane hitting the World Trade Center and writing, ""Wake up New York."" DeSantis said Mamdani appeared to only offer sympathy to an aunt who was on the subway and ""got dirty looks"" after the terror attacks. ""He never expressed the sympathy in that regard for all the people that got murdered. He's always embraced George Soros-style soft-on-crime policies. He hates the NYPD, if you look at his history. He is not going to stand up for law enforcement,"" the governor said. Soros’s son, Alexander, posted a photo captioned that he was proud to be a New Yorker after voting for Mamdani on Tuesday. ""The number one thing that moves people to want to flee these jurisdictions is the collapse of public safety,"" DeSantis added. SOCIALIST SHOCKWAVE: ZOHRAN MAMDANI STUNS NYC AS VOTERS HAND POWER TO DEMOCRATS’ FAR-LEFT FLANK ""And I think he's going to make the [Bill] de Blasio reign look like the Golden Age."" DeSantis noted that New Jersey GOP candidate Jack Ciattarelli came close to defeating Gov. Phil Murphy four years ago — but said countless Republican voters have since left the Garden State for Florida. ""First of all, we're not asking for anyone to move. People have talked about putting a tariff on people moving in at this point, because so many have done so. And I know a lot of people in Florida would think that that would be necessary, but here's just the truth: You look at all 49 other states since I've been governor, look at who's migrated to Florida,"" DeSantis said. FLORIDA MAYOR PREDICTS 'SUBSTANTIAL EXODUS' OF NYC BUSINESSES IF MAMDANI WINS ""[W]hen I got elected, we had 300,000 more registered Democrats in Florida. Today, we have 1.4 million more Republicans. Nobody has ever seen a change that profound."" Fox News Digital reached out to DeSantis’ office as well for further comment on the exodus. DeSantis also commented separately on Virginia voters selecting a man to be their top law enforcement officer who had envisioned the violent murder of a Republican leader and his children: ""That Virginia would elect a guy who wanted to see the children of his political opponents murdered — against a successful Republican incumbent — is a sign that the state is about to move strongly left,"" DeSantis said of Jay Jones’ win over incumbent Jason Miyares. In response to an X follower who asked where DeSantis would house refugees from New York City, the governor quipped: ""Southern Connecticut?"" In remarks Wednesday, Trump echoed DeSantis, saying that Miami will ""soon be the refuge of those fleeing communism in New York City."" Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins separately commented prior to Mamdani’s victory that it is heartbreaking to see what is happening politically in the northeast. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP ""I guess the last thing you can say about that is ‘Don't New York Our Florida’ -- Don't take your doctrine and your indoctrination and bring it down here. We're very free,"" Collins said. ""We stand for freedom and liberty, and we want to keep it that way. So if you're going to come to Florida, you better start espousing how we do things here."" Sharing conservative commentator Benny Johnson's collage of Mamdani calling the NYPD ""Haram"" -- an Islamic Sharia word for sinful or prohibited -- or for the force's defunding, Attorney General James Uthmeier remarked that the left is ""so desperate for a 'W,' they'll cling to Mamdani just to get one."" Mamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens, ran on promises of rent control expansion, climate investment, and city-run groceries.

"Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch voiced concern Wednesday about granting presidents unlimited authority, pressing lawyers to define limits on executive power as the high court heard arguments over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs. Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, questioned both the “major questions” and “nondelegation” doctrines while asking Solicitor General D. John Sauer to outline boundaries to the administration’s broad defense of its tariff powers. The conservative justice warned of “a one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people’s elected representatives” in Congress. Sauer acknowledged that under the same interpretation, a future president could declare climate change a national emergency and impose tariffs to address it — a scenario that appeared to underscore Gorsuch’s warning about unchecked executive authority. Read more: Uncommon Knowledge: Trump’s Tariffs Showdown at Supreme Court Has a Twist Why It Matters The Court heard oral arguments in two cases related to Trump’s ability to authorize tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) on Wednesday. IEEPA is a 1977 law that allows the president to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.” Trump cites IEEPA in executive orders related to reciprocal tariffs, which he states he has the authority to implement. The Supreme Court currently has a 6-3 conservative majority and has previously ruled in favor of the Trump administration on key issues such as immigration enforcement and cuts at federal government agencies. What To Know Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned Sauer about the limitations of the president’s power. “I want it explained to me how you draw the line, because you say we shouldn’t be concerned because this is foreign affairs and the president has inherent authority, and so delegation off the books, more or less. And if that’s true, what would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce, for that matter, declare war, to the president,” Gorsuch said. Sauer responded, “We don’t contend that he could do that.” Several other justices questioned Sauer's arguments, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett. In a brief, Sauer and other attorneys for the administration had argued that the verbiage of IEEPA is “capacious,” granting the president the authority to control a broad range of transactions. Barrett said to Sauer during oral arguments, “You’ve referred to the other verbs in IEEPA as capacious. Would you really describe them as capacious? Because to me, things like nullify and void have definite meanings. I agree with you that regulate is a broader term, but those words I think are powerful, they give, they pack a punch, but I wouldn’t describe them as capacious in the sense that they have a wide range of meanings.” What People Are Saying Justice Neil Gorsuch, during oral arguments: ""Don't we have a serious retrieval problem here? Because once Congress delegates by a bare majority and the president signs it, and of course, every president would sign a law that gives them more authority, Congress can't take that back without a supermajority. And even, you know, even then it's going to be veto-proof. What president is ever going to give that power back? Pretty rare president."" Solicitor General D. John Sauer, during oral arguments: ""I disagree because in January 2023, Congress voted to terminate one of the biggest IEEPA emergencies ever, the COVID emergency, and the president went along with that. So what the statute reflects is there's going to be the ability for a sort of political consensus against a declared emergency.""

"Tariff Dividend: U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday pledged to distribute a $2000 tariff dividend directly to most American citizens, asserting that the plan will be funded entirely through the nation’s booming tariff revenues. The announcement, made via Trump’s Truth Social account, comes as his trade policies face a critical legal test before the U.S. Supreme Court. In his Sunday morning post, President Trump said the United States is “taking in trillions of dollars” through tariffs and will “soon begin paying down our enormous $37 trillion debt.” He added that a dividend of at least $2000 per person, excluding high-income earners, would be paid directly to Americans. No other information about who will be eligible and when the payments will begin has been disclosed yet. The announcement comes amid heightened legal scrutiny of Trump’s tariff policies. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the scope of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), under which Trump justified his wide-ranging levies on imports from China and other nations. Lower courts have previously ruled that many of the tariffs exceeded executive authority. A final ruling from the nation’s highest court could determine whether the president can continue using tariffs as a unilateral fiscal instrument. Despite the pending review, Trump remains defiant. “People that are against tariffs are fools!” he posted on Truth Social, claiming that the tariffs have strengthened America’s manufacturing base and made the country “the richest, most respected in the world.” According to the Treasury Department, customs duties collected in fiscal year 2025 amounted to $195 billion, as per a report by Business Insider.

"Debt Workouts in Europe to Peak in 2026, EY-Parthenon Poll Shows Bankers expect debt restructuring activity to ramp up over the next six months in Europe as companies come under pressure from slowing sales, a sluggish economy and rising energy and materials costs, according to a survey by EY-Parthenon. (Bloomberg) — Bankers expect debt restructuring activity to ramp up over the next six months in Europe as companies come under pressure from slowing sales, a sluggish economy and rising energy and materials costs, according to a survey by EY-Parthenon. Almost half of restructuring professionals in the consultancy firm’s latest survey expect to see a peak in corporate restructuring situations in the first half of 2026. That marks a meaningful shift from EY-Parthenon’s March report, when a majority of bankers saw activity peaking before the end of 2025. The later peak comes as expectations for an economic recovery in the region get pushed out and as lenders — especially private credit firms — become more picky, according to EY-Parthenon. Some stressed companies may have been able to avoid debt restructurings this year due to an abundance of liquidity, but “funds are becoming more selective and for lower-quality borrowers it will be more expensive,” said Henry Beech, a partner in EY-Parthenon’s Turnaround and Restructuring Strategy team. Bankers in the survey expected companies in the automotive and manufacturing sectors to see the most restructuring activity in the second half of 2025. Construction and building materials was the third group on the list, although there has been some stabilization in that industry, the report said. Automotive companies have long been seen as vulnerable due to their high costs and thin margins, while falling demand and trade tensions have piled on more pressure this year. Among situations in the sector, Germany’s Webasto got unanimous consent last month for a restructuring deal in which lenders agreed to provide an additional €200 million ($231 million) of loans and extend €1.2 billion of existing credit lines through the end of 2028. Read: Automotive Industry Is Most Vulnerable to Distress, Survey Finds Competition from China, weak domestic demand and tariff pressures earlier this year have made for “a very challenging cocktail” in industries including automotives, steel and electronics, according to Ben Trask, another partner in EY-Parthenon’s team. EY-Parthenon surveyed 191 restructuring professionals across Europe during September. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Swiss Billionaires Pivotal in Wooing Trump Ahead of Tariff Deal As Switzerland closes in on a deal with the US to lower tariffs on the country, it will owe thanks to some of its richest executives who played a key role in wooing President Donald Trump. (Bloomberg) — As Switzerland closes in on a deal with the US to lower tariffs on the country, it will owe thanks to some of its richest executives who played a key role in wooing President Donald Trump. If the shuttle diplomacy of Switzerland’s top trade diplomat laid the groundwork for an agreement, crucial momentum was generated when businessmen led by billionaire figures from Richemont, Partners Group and Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. met Trump at the White House a week ago. The meeting, which also included Rolex Chief Executive Officer Jean-Frederic Dufour and Marwan Shakarchi, head of gold refiner and trader MKS PAMP Group, was like a gathering of old buddies, according to a person briefed on the encounter. That’s in sharp contrast to the heated conversation that took place between the US president and his Swiss counterpart at the end of July, after which Trump slapped Switzerland with the highest tariff of any developed country. Switzerland has since been engaged in efforts to reduce the levy, which stands at 39%. Bloomberg reported Monday that an agreement to cut it to 15% is close, and Trump said his administration is “working on a deal” to get it lower. The Billionaire Push The executives emphasized that they did not negotiate with Trump at the White House meeting, but their involvement reflects a deliberate Swiss pivot to leverage the strength of its business lobby. Their money and influence nudged Switzerland toward securing better terms. “It’s well known that Trump likes billionaires and business people, so this group isn’t surprising,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank. “The Swiss government has drawn a blank, so there was nothing to lose.” It’s a well worn path. Wealthy business people have been drafted in to lobby the US president on other issues, with Trump last month deciding against sending federal forces to San Francisco after calls with tech billionaires. The Swiss business leaders described their meeting with Trump as “highly constructive.” They raised the suffering of many companies in Switzerland and asked the US president if he thought the 39% import tariff was sustainable, according to the person briefed on the encounter, who asked not to be identified discussing the meeting. “Our discussions highlighted the strength of the private sector relationships that are a cornerstone of our bilateral cooperation and mutual prosperity,” the executives said in a statement. ‘New Dynamic’ Late last week, the Swiss Economic Affairs Department thanked Trump for a “great new dynamic in our bilateral relations.” But they also acknowledged the role played by the executives who included Alfred Gantner, co-founder of private equity firm Partners Group, and Johann Rupert, who leads luxury firm Richemont. Gantner owns 5% of Partners Group, which has a market value of 26 billion francs ($32.5 billion). The net worth of Rupert and his family stands at $17.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Five out of the six businessmen are from companies based in Geneva, highlighting the heft of Switzerland’s second city that’s home to private banks, commodity traders, watchmakers and luxury goods companies. The executives also bore gifts, including a gold Rolex clock and an engraved gold bar, according to media reports. “Trump is predominantly driven by one thing, which is personal gain,” said Kirkegaard. “The guy is a medieval prince, he needs to be buttered up. If it turns out to be private billionaires, then so be it.” The warmth of the Oval Office meeting was far different to the frosty phone conversation between Trump and Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter just over three months ago. When Keller-Sutter pushed back on Trump’s view that Switzerland was responsible for the US losing $40 billion because of its goods trade surplus, the US president was frustrated that his concerns weren’t addressed. But following last week’s visit of what Trump called “high level Representatives of Switzerland,” he ordered US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to schedule follow-up negotiations. Those talks have now pushed Switzerland close to securing a 15% tariff on its exports to the US. —With assistance from Fabienne Kinzelmann, Ben Stupples, Jack Ryan, Hugo Miller and Allegra Catelli.

"Geneva: Switzerland announced plans on Friday to invest $200 billion in the United States through 2028 as the country finalised a hard-wrought deal to slash US tariffs on Swiss goods.

"NEW YORK (AP) — Black Friday no longer tempts people to leave Thanksgiving tables for midnight mall runs, but the annual sales event still brings more shoppers into stores than any day of the year and still rules as the U.S. retail industry’s unofficial start of the holiday shopping season. This year’s kickoff arrived as consumer confidence in the U.S. economy fell this month in the aftermath of the federal government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to a report The Conference Board issued Tuesday. Many retail executives have reported customers becoming more discerning and increasingly focused on deals while at the same time remaining willing to splash out for important occasions like the start of the school year and the winter holidays, creating a halo effect. “Consumers have been saying the economy is terrible while continuing to spend for years now, so the outlook is probably better than they are telling us,” Bill Adams, the chief economist at Comerica Bank, said this week of shoppers’ moods heading into Black Friday. “But business surveys also report consumers are being more sensitive to prices and selective in spending.” At Macy’s Herald Square flagship store in New York City, a steady stream of shoppers went hunting for deep discounts on clothes, shoes, linens and cosmetics soon after the store’s 6 a.m. opening. Among the busiest sections was footwear, which was 40% to 50% off. But unlike past years, when customers snatched boxes from big stacks, the mood was calm. Veronica Nam, 68, headed to the shoe department to buy Nike sneakers for her husband after spending $256 on Lacoste bedding that she estimated cost half the regular price. Nam said she thought Black Friday has the best holiday deals but that she planned to wait until after Christmas to finish buying gifts for other relatives. She said it was hard to know when to find the best prices given the unpredictability of President Donald Trump ’s wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods and . several years of inflation. “Food is very expensive,“ she said. Nicholas Menasche, 19, from Queens, New York, was shopping with his mother at Macy’s and then planned to head to Best Buy for video games. Menasche, an intern at a bank, plans to spend around $1,200 this year on his holiday shopping, roughly the same as last year. “I’m here to buy stuff. Shoes and clothes,” he said. “It’s a great tradition. The stores are open really early.” While planning for the holidays in the spring and summer, retail companies were wrestling with the Trump administration’s volatile tariff policies. Many accelerated shipments of some merchandise before the tariffs took effect or decided to absorb some of the import tax costs instead of raising prices for customers. Market research firm Circana said that 40% of all general merchandise sold in September saw a price increase of at least 5% compared with the first four months of the year. Toys, baby products, housewares, and team sports equipment were among the hardest hit categories. For example, 83% of toys sold in September saw an increase of at least 5%, Circana said. Industry group The Toy Association says nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. are made in China, a country the Trump administration hit with especially high tariffs at various points this year. Still, analysts and mall executives cited solid momentum heading into Black Friday week. At the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, foot traffic in recent weeks surpassed the numbers from pre-pandemic 2019, said Jill Renslow, the mall’s chief business development and marketing officer. “We’re seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,” Renslow said. “The last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.” The growth in online sales also has been robust so far. From Nov. 1 to Nov. 23, consumers spent $79.7 billion, according to web tracking and analysis platform Adobe Analytics. That represented a gain of 7.5% from a year earlier and was bigger than Adobe’s 5.3% growth forecast for the season. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods, predicted a 3.6% increase in holiday sales from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase last year. “Clearly, there’s uncertainty,” Mastercard Chief Economist Michelle Meyer said. “Clearly, consumers feel on edge. But at the moment, it doesn’t seem like it’s changing how they are showing up for this season.” According to Adobe Analytics, Thanksgiving Day was the best time to shop online to get the deepest discount on sporting goods. But Black Friday will be the best time to buy TVs, toys and appliances online. Cyber Monday, however, should be the best time to buy apparel and computers. Apparel discounts peaked at 12.2% off the suggested manufacturer’s price between Nov. 1 and Nov. 23 but are expected to hit 25% off on Cyber Monday, Adobe said.",right

If you go back to Liberation Day in April, do you remember what they said? The economy was going to collapse. This was going to be a 1929 depression, America is over, this is it,” Moreno said. He added, “I can’t tell you, I could name 100 CEOs that have been in our office. We’re rebuilding America because of tariffs.” Moreno continued, “If you’re from America, you’re going to bring more high-paying jobs to the United States, that’s fantastic.” Moreno has championed the president’s tariff policies in Congress’s upper chamber. In June, Moreno tore into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for ignoring Democrat-driven inflation, while claiming that Trump’s trade policies would lead to inflation and cost $400 billion per year: Powell didn’t comment when Dems sent inflation soaring with Covid lockdowns, vaccine mandates, LNG export bans, and massive tax hikes. But he’s all too happy to attack President Trump’s trade agenda. He’s costing America 100s of billions and should resign. Speaking to Powell, Moreno continued, “Inflation in America is down. We got elected by millions of voters. You got elected by one person who doesn’t want you to be in that job. You are costing this government $400 billion a year by refusing to lower interest rates. Nobody in this chamber has that kind of power to have a $400 billion impact on this economy, on our deficit.” He added, “And I just think that you should consider whether you’re really looking at this from a fiscal lens or a political lens, because you just don’t like tariffs.” At a Breitbart policy event in July, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused the Fed of suffering from “Tariff Derangement Syndrome.” WATCH THE EVENT: COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Leftist Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney admitted this weekend he had apologized to President Donald Trump in person during their mutual attendance at events related to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea last week. Carney made the apology over an advertisement produced by the provincial government of Ontario and airing in the United States, using the words of former President Ronald Reagan to oppose American tariffs on Canadian goods. Omitted from the ad was the fact that Reagan’s speech was, in fact, an announcement of the imposition of tariffs on Japan and that, while Reagan opposed tariffs as a permanent fixture in trade, he often used them as tools to improve America’s trade relationships with other countries. Carney emphasized that the government of Ontario did not act with federal approval, that Ottawa had ultimate authority over Canadian foreign policy, and that he had personally told Ontario Premier Doug Ford that he opposed the advertisement. “I did, I did apologize to the president,” Carney confirmed on Saturday. “The president was offended by the ad, and it’s not something I would have done, which is to put in place that advertisement, so I apologized to him.” In an apparent attempt to enforce authority over the provinces, Carney added, “I am the one who is responsible in my role as prime minister for the relationship with the president of the United States, and the federal government is responsible for the foreign relationship with the U.S. government. So things happen, we take the good with the bad, I apologized to him.” Carney admitted to the apology after President Trump told reporters that it had occurred during his flight back from South Korea on Friday. “I have a very good relationship. I like him a lot. But you know what they did was wrong. He was very nice, he apologized for what they did with the commercial,” Mr. Trump said, referring to Carney and the Reagan ad. “He did apologize, and I appreciated it. We had a great dinner, you know, with other countries, as you know, and I think we have a very good relationship, personally.” The advertisement in question played snippets of a 1987 speech by Reagan in which he stated that, “over the long run,” tariffs “hurt every American worker and consumer. High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars.” The audio clips of the speech play over dire images of struggling families. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute condemned the advertisement, stating that it used “selective audio and video” and “misrepresents” the speech. The Institute published the full speech that the advertisement used and announced it was “reviewing legal options,” as the government of Ontario “did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks.” The website Politifact also published an article condemning the advertisement as misleading. “The ad did not present Reagan’s remarks in chronological order. It also omitted that during the same speech,” Politifact noted, “Reagan said he was placing new duties on Japanese products because Japan had not enforced a trade agreement. He described this as a special case in which tariffs were justified.” Trump announced shortly after the publication of the advertisement that he would terminate all trade talks with Canada in response to the “FAKE” ad. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called it “unacceptable.” “It’s the equivalent of election interference. Nobody likes foreign election interference. Nobody likes foreign governments trying to sway public opinion for their own good,” he said in an interview with CNN on Sunday. Ford defended his decision in an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal, claiming that he “admire[s] Reagan and his commitment to free trade.” “Our government ran an ad featuring the words of President Reagan because we all benefit from being reminded of his wisdom,” Ford wrote. “As the Gipper said, ‘protectionism’ is ‘destructionism,’ and the ‘way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition.’” Carney’s apology is the latest in a string of concessions to the White House since he was elected prime minister in April – shocking behavior given his entire political campaign being centered on challenging Trump and using Canada’s leverage to thwart the American president’s agenda. Prior to his appointment as the head of the government of Canada, Carney had no political experience; he left a high position at Brookfield Asset Management to enter politics. Carney campaigned for the position in anticipation of a special election in April, which followed the abrupt resignation of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau. As a candidate, Carney regularly promised to singularly focus on fighting Trump. “We will need to dramatically reduce our reliance on the United States,” candidate Carney promised. “We will need to pivot our trade relationships elsewhere … There will be no turning back.” Carney declared the American-Canadian relationship “over” and condemned his rival, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, as a reliable Trump ally. In reality, Trump endorsed Carney, calling Poilievre “stupid” for distancing himself from Trump and other international conservatives. “We are going to fight these tariffs with countermeasures. We are going to protect our workers and we are going to build the strongest economy in the G7,” Carney promised in April. The Canadian prime minister changed his disposition almost immediately after defeating Poilievre – who lost a 26-point polling lead in January and his own Parliamentary seat in the race. During his first visit to the White House, Carney called Trump a “transformational president.” Carney dropped Trudeau-era retaliatory tariffs on American goods in August, and lowered tariffs on aluminum in October. “Canada and the United States have reestablished free trade for the vast majority of our goods. Canada will retain our tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos as we work intensively to resolve the issues there,” Carney declared in August, rescinding his initial stance during election season. Shortly before that tariff drop, in July, Carney told reporters he did not see “much evidence” that he was capable of coming to a trade deal with Washington that would eliminate tariffs, abandoning his signature campaign promise.

"Listen to this article in summarized format According to Gaurang Shah, Head Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, the Africa business — once a drag on Airtel’s balance sheet — is now turning into a key growth engine. “The African business, which earlier weighed on earnings, is now stabilizing and expanding its customer base. The key here is sustainability before improvement, and Airtel seems to be achieving both,” Shah told ET Now. He added that higher realizations and improving subscriber mix are strengthening Airtel’s financial performance across markets. ARPU headed toward ₹275–300, domestic growth strong Shah said Airtel’s domestic operations continue to show strong momentum, with ARPU currently around ₹256 and expected to rise significantly in the coming quarters.“ARPU levels are improving steadily. Across telecom service providers, we’re seeing ARPUs inch toward ₹275–300 over the next few quarters,” he said. He attributed this growth to the steady increase in smartphone penetration and higher data consumption among Indian users. “With India adding millions of smartphone users every month, the revenue potential per user will only grow. The domestic business looks absolutely robust and well-positioned for the next growth phase,” he noted. EBITDA margin crosses 48%, beats estimates Airtel reported an EBITDA margin above 48%, surpassing market expectations. Shah said this reflects the company’s operational efficiency and strong revenue mix from both data and voice segments.“The margin performance is better than expected. Efficiency levels have improved considerably, and the data-to-voice ratio is driving profitability,” he said. Airtel’s strategic focus on premium customers, broadband expansion, and cost optimization has contributed to the margin boost. Africa business transformation a key positive Once seen as a risky bet, Airtel Africa has become a major contributor to overall revenue growth. Subscriber expansion and improving realizations in key African markets have strengthened its earnings profile.“Africa has turned from being a balance-sheet concern to a meaningful growth contributor. If the region continues to show stability and revenue visibility, Airtel will have a strong dual engine — domestic and African markets — propelling its performance,” Shah said. Tariff hikes likely by late 2025 or early 2026? Shah also hinted that the next round of tariff hikes could come by late 2025 or early 2026, potentially lifting sector-wide profitability.“Street discussions suggest a likely tariff hike by the end of 2025 or early 2026. That could further strengthen EBITDA margins across telecom operators,” he said. The expected tariff revision, coupled with higher ARPUs and efficiency gains, could cement Airtel’s market leadership. Key takeaways - Airtel’s Africa business turnaround is driving profitability. - ARPU to rise from ₹256 to ₹275–300 over the next few quarters. - EBITDA margin beats estimates at over 48%, signaling strong operational control. - Tariff hikes likely by end-2025 or early-2026. - Domestic and Africa segments together to sustain long-term growth momentum.

"President Donald Trump said Monday that Americans could see payment checks funded by tariff revenues as soon as next year, promising that ""hundreds of millions of dollars in tariff money"" would be distributed as dividends by mid-2026. ""We've taken in hundreds of millions of dollars in tariff money. We're going to be issuing dividends probably by the middle of next year, maybe a little bit later than that,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. The president first floated the idea last week, saying he would use tariff revenue to send $2,000 payments to low- and middle-income Americans, with any remaining funds directed toward paying down the nation’s soaring debt. TRUMP CALLS TARIFF OPPONENTS 'FOOLS,' PROMISES $2K DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FOR AMERICANS With the nation’s debt hovering just north of $38 trillion, revenue from tariffs amount to little more than a rounding error: billions collected against trillions owed. The proposal comes at a pivotal moment, with tariff receipts climbing and the Supreme Court reviewing the legality of Trump’s trade measures. Since Trump announced his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs in April, tariff revenues have climbed sharply from $23.9 billion in May to $28 billion in June and $29 billion in July. Total duty revenue reached $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, which ended Sept. 30, according to the Treasury Department’s Customs and Certain Excise Taxes report. TRUMP DEFENDS TARIFFS, SAYS US HAS BEEN ‘THE KING OF BEING SCREWED’ BY TRADE IMBALANCE So far in fiscal year 2026, which began on Oct. 1, the U.S. has collected $37.5 billion, according to the latest numbers published by the Treasury Department. And while tariff collections have soared under Trump, they remain a modest contributor to federal coffers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By contrast, individual income taxes generated more than $2.6 trillion in fiscal 2025, compared with $195 billion from tariffs and $452 billion from corporate income taxes, Treasury figures show. The nation’s highest court is still in the process of deciding the fate of Trump’s trade agenda and the tariffs in question.",right
"“Representatives from SEZ units and developers highlighted issues related to DTA transactions, duty foregone, ICEGATE connectivity constraints, import monitoring systems, and reverse job work challenges faced by MSMEs,” the commerce and industry ministry said in a statement. Agrawal assured industry that connectivity concerns with BSNL and issues related to import monitoring systems would be reviewed. He said that shifts in global value chains, increased demand for DTA market access, and the evolving impact of free trade pacts necessitate SEZ policies that align with current economic realities. IT/ITES stakeholders raised concerns over rules on vacant built-up area classification, timelines for renewal of Letters of Approval and procurement attestation requirements that differ from GST norms, according to the statement. Participants also drew attention to the lack of parity for SEZ units under concessional import duty and duty drawback schemes available to DTA units, operational inefficiencies introduced by the new Procurement Certificate process, countervailing duties imposed by the US, and the need to review QCO applicability for SEZ-to-DTA sales. “He assured that the ministry would examine each challenge in detail with a view to strengthening ease of doing business…He emphasised the importance of long-term vision and data-driven policymaking,” it said.

"The RatingDog China General Services PMI, compiled by S&P Global, slipped to 52.6 from 52.9 in September, staying above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction. This contrasted slightly with the government's official PMI released on Monday, which rose to 50.2 from 50.1 in September, reflecting differences in sample coverage. RatingDog's index is viewed as a better gauge of smaller, export-oriented service providers along China's east coast, while the official PMI primarily tracks large and medium-sized enterprises, including state-owned companies. China remains on track to meet its economic target of around 5% this year, though a prolonged property slump, weak domestic demand, and trade uncertainty continue pressuring policymakers to introduce more stimulus. Policymakers last month unveiled their economic plan for 2026-2030, prioritising manufacturing and technology self-reliance while pledging to boost consumption. The survey showed growth in the services sector was driven by faster expansion in new business, while new export business contracted for the first time in four months, with survey respondents citing global trade uncertainties. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week reached an agreement including U.S. tariff reductions and a pause on Beijing's new restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets, extending a fragile trade truce between the world's two largest economies. ""Sustained employment contraction and pressure on profit margins remain the main constraints facing the sector,"" said Yao Yu, founder at RatingDog. On the employment front, staffing levels declined at a quicker pace in October as capacity pressure eased. Service providers reduced outstanding business for the first time since March. Input cost inflation accelerated to a one-year high, driven by higher raw material and wage costs. However, selling prices were lowered as companies absorbed cost increases to support sales amid intensifying competition. Overall sentiment about the one-year outlook remained positive but weakened a little, with some companies concerned about global trade prospects and increased competition. The Composite Output Index fell to 51.8 in October from 52.5, reflecting weaker output growth across both manufacturing and service sectors.

"While everyone was busy moaning about the housing market, affordability improved Robert McLister: The average mortgage borrower is in a much better position today than just three and a half years ago Mortgage unaffordability has been front-page news for years. It’s why the average age of a first-time home buyer in Canada is now around 40 — among the highest in the world, according to a recent Bloom Holdings report. Yet for all the misery facing first-time buyers, things have grudgingly improved. To illustrate, we can compare the real estate peak in 2022 to today, and then factor in: - The 18 per cent drop in national average home prices since that peak - A homebuyer couple, each working 40 hours a week at the average wage - Today’s leading nationally advertised five-year fixed rate of 3.69 per cent - The minimum down payment, plus default insurance fees - A 30-year amortization If we crunch it all together, we stumble upon a surprising result. The share of income needed to support an average home purchase (a.k.a. the “gross debt service” or “GDS” ratio, in industry jargon) has fallen to 32 per cent. That’s a solid ten-point drop from the 42 per cent nosebleed level we were staring at in 2022, and thirty-two per cent has long been the recommended standard GDS ratio. So, while affordability is still uncomfortably high for many, the average borrower is in a much better position today than just three and a half years ago — progress that few noticed because most of us were too busy lamenting high rates and tight housing supply. Of course, averages hide a lot of financial pain. For fresh grads clutching entry-level paycheques, or anyone stubborn enough to want a backyard in Toronto or Vancouver, the math turns from uncomfortable to outright hostile. “If I were counselling my kids between renting and buying, I’d probably suggest they rent in the GTA and GVA,” says Martin Frenette, chief executive at Strive Capital Corporation. And this is coming from a lender that makes the bulk of its revenue in insured mortgage lending (i.e., lending to purchasers without 20 per cent down payments). - The best mortgage rates in Canada right now - The best reverse mortgage rates in Canada right now - Advertisement 1Story continues below “But you can’t have one answer to that question across the country,” he points out, since most of Canada isn’t trapped in the same pressure cooker as Toronto and Vancouver. “It goes back to household economics and measuring your monthly mortgage costs against income. You don’t want to exceed standard guidelines if you can help it,” he said. That means sticking near the 32 GDS rule of thumb, if possible, so you have breathing room. Of course, living within one’s means is much easier to do in some markets than others. That’s why lenders and default insurers let buyers go up to 39 per cent GDS ratios if they qualify. Either way, this affordability improvement is showing up in the numbers. Default insured purchase volumes were up 25 per cent in the latest reported 12-month period, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). It turns out that when monthly payments drop from “impossible” to merely “painful,” people start signing on the dotted line again. And, aside from falling interest rates, government policy has been the most significant driver of those purchases. Last year, the feds rolled out 30-year amortizations for first-time and new construction buyers. Ottawa also raised the maximum default-insurable purchase price from $1 million to $1.5 million. “We’ve seen a significant bump in volume because of the rule changes,” Frenette says. “Overall loan size has gone up 10 to 15 per cent depending on jurisdiction, mostly in Ontario and B.C.” “Thirty-year amortizations now account for 60 per cent of our high-ratio insured business,” he adds. That’s similar to what I’m hearing from other lenders. It’s also in line with the latest national numbers from the Bank of Canada, which confirm that half of insured borrowers are now stretching payments over three decades, up from precisely nobody doing it twelve months earlier. And of that group, nearly half (46 per cent according to Canada Guaranty) would not have qualified for the same mortgage at a 25-year amortization. “That rule change has opened the door for first-time buyers,” Frenette concludes. The million-and-a-half-dollar question is, if home prices adjust upwards because of the increased buying power, are borrowers further ahead long term? We’ll park that philosophical hand grenade for a later column. For now, any rookie buyer reading this should remember one thing: just because someone can qualify for a mortgage doesn’t mean they should get one. Beyond the nightmare of unemployment, the top worry for anyone scraping together a measly five-per-cent down should be: if disaster strikes — like Trump’s tariff policies tipping us into a 2026 recession and prices taking a beating — could you stomach zero equity in your castle for what feels like eternity? This is not a home price prediction, but think about what would happen if values dropped another 10 per cent, for example. An insured buyer purchasing Canada’s average-priced home of $690,195 with the minimum down payment (currently 6.4 per cent on that purchase price), would still owe $606,000 after five years of payments. Yet, their home would only be worth about $621,000, stranding them at a sky-high 98 per cent loan-to-value. That means they’d be stuck in that house — unless they wanted to sell and take a loss, in which case their original down payment would be gone forever. And refinancing would be entirely out of the question because you need 20 per cent equity for that. All you could do is switch to another lender for a better rate — assuming you could find one that was comfortable with your qualifications, property and high loan-to-value ratio. So, while affordability has definitely improved — a positive for real estate markets and borrowers with a financial safety net — maxing out leverage demands a hard look at your future options, or lack thereof.

"Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will join trade ministers of the 27 European Union states for the first high-level talks between the bloc and American officials since the tariff deal. Brussels and Washington clinched a deal in July for most EU exports to face a 15-percent US levy, but both sides are still pushing for additional trade concessions. The EU wants the United States to lower its 50-percent duties on steel and aluminium, while Washington demands Brussels roll back green and digital rules. ""We also recognise that more work lies ahead, especially on steel and derivatives, where we seek both to reduce tariff and to confront global overcapacity together,"" EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic told reporters. The United States in August added 407 product types to a list of items considered steel and aluminium ""derivative products"" and therefore subject to higher tariffs. But Sefcovic played down any expectation of a breakthrough. ""Today it's not about negotiations. This is about the stocktaking exercise,"" he added. The EU is also pushing for a broader ""metals alliance"" with the United States to ringfence their respective economies from Chinese overcapacity. Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the talks will be a chance to discuss how to ""stabilise trade relations between Europe and US"". He added it was ""a great opportunity to discuss problems we have in common: the global trade system, China, etcetera"". Some EU ministers made it clear steel was a priority. ""We have to have the normal agreement on steel and aluminium, and work on it. Wehave to implement swiftly what was agreed back in August,"" Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys said. ""Getting steel tariffs to 15 percent is part of implementing our joint statement. It's very much in the spirit that the joint statement was prepared,"" Poland's Michal Baranowski said. Reducing the tariffs was not directly mentioned in the text published in August but the EU is seeking steel import quotas in talks with US officials.

"Executives at Ford Motor Company are praising President Donald Trump’s expanded auto tariffs, saying such duties will ensure that manufacturing in the United States is no longer a disadvantage for American companies. Last month, Trump announced a 25% tariff on imports of medium and heavy-duty trucks and truck parts, such as large pick-up trucks, moving trucks, cargo trucks, dump trucks, and tractors for eighteen-wheelers. In a recent earnings call, Ford CEO Jim Farley thanked Trump for the newly announced tariffs on foreign cars and car parts. “I’d like to thank President Trump and his team for the recent tariff policy developments, which are favorable to Ford as the most American auto manufacturer,” Farley said: In addition, tariffs leveling the playing field for those imported medium and heavy-duty trucks is a positive for Ford because we are no longer disadvantaged for building every single one of our super duty trucks here in the United States. [Emphasis added] Likewise, Ford placed an ad campaign in several newspapers backing Trump’s tariffs and vowing to continue building their cars in the United States. “At our assembly plants in Michigan, Missouri, Kentucky, and Ohio, tens of thousands of [United Auto Worker] members put their expertise and pride into assembling Ford F-series trucks,” the ad reads. “In an era of complex supply chains, our commitment to the American workforce is unwavering. We believe the backbone of our economy is supported by American workers.” CNN, last week, admitted that Trump’s tariffs on the auto industry had not decimated such automakers as economists and auto executives claimed without evidence would happen. “Automakers were close to panic when Trump announced plans for a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, including those from Mexico and Canada, since all companies depend on imported parts to build at US assembly plants and almost all import from those neighboring countries,” the CNN report admits: But it turned out it wasn’t as bad as they feared, as Trump continued to reduce the worst of the duties’ impact almost immediately. General Motors and Ford, which had forecast billions in annual costs, have each reduced those assessments. GM trimmed its $5 billion estimate by $500 million last month. Ford cut its estimated tariff cost for 2025 in half, from $2 billion to $1 billion. [Emphasis added] Another claim repeated almost daily by talking heads but not founded in consumer price data is that consumers would pay higher prices because of the tariffs. But CNN admitted that auto “companies have not passed on the increased tariff costs to consumers, at least not directly.” John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"South Africa's 'Everything Rally' Hinges on Economic Promises The searing rally across South African assets this year risks running out of steam unless economic growth picks up enough to make a dent in the nation’s sky-high unemployment rate. (Bloomberg) — The searing rally across South African assets this year risks running out of steam unless economic growth picks up enough to make a dent in the nation’s sky-high unemployment rate. Stocks, bonds and the currency have surged amid soaring commodity prices and government reforms. The benchmark equity index is up about 46% in dollar terms, local-currency government debt has returned more than double the emerging-market average, and the rand is on track for its strongest year against the dollar since 2022. But it would be a mistake to assume those gains will continue in 2026, according to the country’s biggest private investor. With gross domestic product growth struggling to accelerate above 1% and almost a third of the country’s working-age population unemployed, companies will find it hard to generate the kind of profits that would justify the returns their shares have seen in 2025. “The question is job creation, job creation and job creation,” said Hendrik du Toit, chief executive of Ninety One Plc, which oversees about 3.5 trillion rand ($202 billion). “Without it, you simply will not sustain momentum. Some of these businesses will do well, but the feast has been had.” Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana delivered a-better-than-expected budget update earlier his month, with revenue overshooting previous projections and the National Treasury recommitting to its fiscal-consolidation plans. S&P Global Ratings responded by upgrading South Africa’s credit assessment for the first time since 2005. Power cuts have virtually ceased and the nation’s coalition government has moved to tackle logistical constraints that have hamstrung exports. The turnaround follows years of negativity over electricity shortages, state corruption, political uncertainty and surging living costs. Gross domestic product expanded by an average of less than 1% a year over the past decade, and the unemployment rate remains above 30%. The National Treasury expects the average growth rate to accelerate to 1.8% over the next three years, but some investors caution that any investment surge is contingent on the improved outlook materializing. “Structural reforms that create jobs are essential,” said JPMorgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman Daniel Pinto at Bloomberg’s Africa Business Summit earlier this month. “The government is doing some of the right things, and if reform deepens, the informal economy will shrink and living standards will improve.” The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index is set for its best year since 2006, outperforming the emerging-market benchmark, the S&P 500 and the Stoxx Europe 600. Much of the gain was driven by the surge in gold, silver, and platinum prices, which lifted an index of precious-metals miners more than 180%. A net 75% of fund managers in a Bank of America Corp. survey conducted earlier this month are bullish South African equities, up from 69% in the previous poll. Banks and retailers are among the most overweight sectors, suggesting they could lead the next leg of the rally along with industrials and renewable-energy-linked plays — provided government reforms unlock economic growth. “Finance is very big here and continues to do well, but finance can only prosper if the economy comes through,” Du Toit said. He estimates that South African companies have about $100 billion on their balance sheets that could be unlocked if the government overhauled regulations constraining investment. The bond market, meanwhile, has been supported by moderating inflation, lower interest rates and fiscal consolidation. Government rand bonds have returned about 32% in dollar terms this year, compared with 15% for a Bloomberg country-capped index of local-currency debt. Foreign investors are flocking to the market, with net inflows of 175 billion rand in the year through October, compared with 73 billion rand in the whole of last year, according to National Treasury data. Still, non-residents hold only about a quarter of outstanding government debt, down from as high as 43% seven years ago. That leaves plenty of room for upside as Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts prompt investors to look for better returns outside the US. Some investors, however, say further gains will be harder to come by. Yields on 10-year government bonds have plunged more than 170 basis points this year and are near record lows. That makes them expensive relative to history, even though the yields remain attractive compared with global fixed income, said David Austerweil, an emerging-markets deputy portfolio manager at Van Eck Associates Corp. in New York. “We’ve moved to market weight in South African government bonds after having been very overweight all year, given major catalysts have been realized and bond valuations are less cheap,” he said. “However, we think there is still upside next year. The fundamental story continues to improve and we think that will continue to support asset prices.” The rand is benefiting from improved terms of trade due to rising values of commodity exports, as well as the attractive carry returns generated by the interest-rate differential with the US and historically low volatility. The South Africa currency has gained 10% against the dollar this year, returning 13% for traders who borrow dollars to buy higher-yielding assets. Yet options positioning shows traders are turning more bearish on the rand over the coming year, using current levels to lock in hedges against declines. The premium of options to sell the rand over the next year versus those to buy it, known as the 25 Delta Risk Reversal, has climbed more than 50 basis points since the end of August to the widest since President Trump’s April tariff announcements roiled markets. Bloomberg’s forecast model, based on the prices of options to buy and sell the rand versus the dollar, assigns a 46% probability to the currency strengthening from current levels over the next 12 months, versus a 54% probability of weakening. “We expect the rand to continue to strengthen next year but are not expecting the performance to be as good as this year,” said Lee Hardman, a senior currency analyst at MUFG Bank Ltd. Financial assets have already priced in a lot of good news in a short space of time. The foundations are in place, but a more durable cycle will require deeper policy reforms to spark an improvement in the real economy, said Lester Davids, an analyst at Unum Capital Ltd. “Once the growth engine moves, capital will flow,” he said. “South Africa has advantages. It’s not that difficult, but we have to get the basics right.” —With assistance from Prinesha Naidoo. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the plan is already under review, with multiple methods being considered for implementation. Rather than sending out physical checks to citizens, Bessent said the government may deliver the dividend through tax cuts, credits, or direct savings. Options being studied include eliminating federal taxes on tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits, as well as expanding tax deductions on car loans and mortgages. Bessent emphasized that the $2,000 figure represents the overall financial benefit to each qualifying American, not necessarily a single lump-sum payment. While the announcement has generated excitement, key details remain uncertain. The Treasury has yet to confirm who exactly qualifies for the dividend, how “high-income” individuals will be defined, or when the payments will begin. Preliminary estimates suggest that roughly 120 million Americans could be eligible, depending on income thresholds. If each eligible person receives $2,000 in tax relief or refunds, the total fiscal cost could exceed $240 billion, making it one of the largest direct benefit programs ever linked to trade revenues. The administration insists that the program will be fully funded by the tariff surplus—money collected from taxes on imported goods, including electronics, vehicles, and industrial materials. Trump has repeatedly argued that tariffs have strengthened U.S. manufacturing and generated record revenue from foreign producers. Supporters say the dividend would prove that tariffs benefit working Americans, not just government coffers. Critics, however, warn that the plan could trigger inflation or strain federal finances if implemented too broadly. What is Trump’s $2000 tariff dividend? President Donald Trump has announced that most Americans will receive a $2,000 “tariff dividend” funded by U.S. trade revenues. The money will come from tariffs collected under his administration’s new trade policies. Trump made the announcement on his Truth Social account, saying, “Every American, not including high-income people, will get a $2,000 dividend.”According to reports, the White House and Treasury officials are exploring how to deliver this benefit to citizens. Trump called it a “reward for hardworking Americans” and linked it to what he described as record-breaking economic growth. He said the U.S. is “the richest and most respected country in the world,” pointing to a strong stock market, job creation, and what he claims is low inflation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that the $2,000 figure represents a combination of benefits rather than just a one-time payment. He noted that “it could come in lots of ways” — such as tax breaks, refunds, or direct credits instead of checks. Who qualifies for the $2000 tariff payout? The plan targets middle- and low-income Americans. Trump has made clear that “high-income people” will be excluded from the payout, though no official income threshold has been published yet. Treasury officials said that the goal is to return tariff-generated revenue to working Americans who have faced higher import costs in recent years.Economic analysts suggest the dividend could apply to roughly 120 million eligible adults, depending on income caps. If each eligible person receives $2,000, the total fiscal impact could exceed $240 billion. Officials say funding would come from the surplus tariff revenue collected on imported goods, including electronics, vehicles, and consumer products. However, some details remain uncertain. The administration has not yet confirmed the exact payment date, eligibility criteria, or distribution process. The plan may need Congressional approval if delivered through the tax system, which could delay implementation. How will Americans receive the tariff dividend? Scott Bessent has indicated that the payout may be indirect, meaning not everyone will receive a physical check. Instead, the Treasury could apply the dividend through tax credits, deductions, or targeted relief programs in 2026.Possible mechanisms include: - No federal tax on tips or overtime income. - Tax exemptions for Social Security benefits. - Increased deductibility for car loans and mortgage interest. Why is the dividend being announced now? The timing is both economic and political. Trump’s administration is pushing this plan amid growing debate over U.S. tariffs and trade policy. Supporters say the dividend redistributes tariff revenue to ordinary citizens, proving tariffs can help Americans, not just raise prices.Critics, however, call the plan political messaging before the 2026 midterms. Economists warn that if the government injects billions into consumer pockets, it could raise inflation pressures. The Guardian reports that if all eligible citizens receive the $2,000, it could cost hundreds of billions — raising questions about sustainability and long-term fiscal impact. Bessent defended the move, saying the U.S. has built a “trade surplus cushion” that allows it to reinvest in its people without increasing national debt. For now, the $2,000 tariff dividend remains a proposed policy, not an enacted program. Treasury and IRS officials are expected to clarify the distribution timeline and eligibility rules in the coming weeks. If executed, it could mark one of the largest direct benefits tied to tariff revenue in U.S. history. Until then, taxpayers should watch for official updates from the U.S. Treasury Department or IRS.gov. The dividend could take the form of a 2026 tax credit or deduction rather than an immediate payment. Economists say the policy could reshape how the government uses tariff income — shifting from deficit reduction to direct citizen relief. Whether this $2,000 promise becomes a reality will depend on Congress, the courts, and the final structure approved by the Treasury.

"Posthaste: Number of Canadians renegotiating loans rising dramatically with economy in 'semi-recession' CIBC says lenders are stepping in to keep distressed consumers from going under and protect their bottom line and the economy With insolvencies on the rise, Canadians floundering in debt are getting more of a helping hand from lenders looking to keep distressed consumers from going under and protect their bottom line and the economy. That’s the assessment of Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets. “We are seeing pre-emptive activity by lenders. Basically calling people and saying, ‘Let’s go have coffee and discuss your situation,'” he said during a podcast with CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld. “The economy is in a semi-recession, second-quarter growth was negative, third quarter was hardly above zero. One accident and we are in a recession.” One sign that lenders are stepping in is the ongoing rise in the number of proposals to renegotiate the terms of loans. Such proposals have been “rising dramatically” over the past few years while bankruptcies have been “falling dramatically,” Tal said. “It’s much better for the system; it’s much cheaper to have proposals than bankruptcies,” he said. Fresh numbers on Canadian insolvencies, which include proposals and bankruptcies, back Tal up. Proposals in Canada are up 41.2 per cent from 2019 and 8.2 per cent from September 2024, according to data released this week. Bankruptcies, meanwhile, fell 35 per cent below their pre-pandemic level. Proposals account for approximately 76 per cent of total insolvencies. Overall, insolvencies are up nearly 11 per cent compared with 2019 and have reached “levels not seen since the global financial crisis in 2009,” Charles St-Arnaud, chief economist with credit union Alberta Central, said in a note. Provincially, insolvencies are “significantly higher” in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Alberta and Saskatchewan compared with 2019. St-Arnaud pointed to higher-than-average consumer debt levels in those provinces as the culprit. There are other signs banks are stepping in to protect their loan books, Tal said. Loan payment delinquencies in the 30-to-60-day range are dramatically up, he said, but they are stable in the 60-to-90-day range, whereas the normal trend would be for those numbers to rise as well. “Again, there is this pre-emptive move by lenders to say, ‘Let’s try to deal with this situation before it becomes unsustainable,'” he said. While bankers might be trying to hold the line, borrowing amongst Canadians with poorer debt profiles is nonetheless starting to deteriorate. The 30-day delinquency rate among the subprime sector is up 13 per cent from 2019. “This is the first signal I see that things are getting worse when it comes to credit quality,” Tal said. He said he will also be keeping an eye on the rising rate of credit-card and line-of-credit delinquencies among mortgage holders, which he said have jumped above 2019 levels. “Clearly, there are some early signs of difficulties, but the numbers are not so significant to make me worry,” Tal said. Both Tal and St-Arnaud think the job market is currently resilient enough to help Canadians weather the economic storm of tariffs. “The labour market’s resilience, where the number of layoffs remains low, is also playing a crucial role, allowing borrowers to weather various shocks by adjusting their lending to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on their regular payment,” St-Arnaud said. CIBC estimates the unemployment rate has peaked at 7.1 per cent. It fell to 6.9 per cent in October. Tal said he expects consumer credit trouble to manifest in the “micro” economy, not the macro economy. “My sense is financial institutions are already ready for this situation,” he said.

After Donald Trump’s inauguration, Desjardins Group compiled a list of 32 Canadian sectors to asses their vulnerability to U.S. tariffs. Economists at Desjardins recently reviewed their list and found that some sectors they thought would be very vulnerable were less so, while others were more vulnerable than expected. The chart above reflects the changes Desjardins made to its vulnerability index for a selection of the sectors. The assigned dots of red, yellow, and green stand respectively for “highly negative impact,” “to watch” and “likely limited impact.” Initially, Desjardins expected there would be little impact on Canada’s auto sector given its integration with the United States and Mexico. That’s not how things have played out. “While Canadian auto parts manufacturers aren’t directly targeted, as long as they are compliant with the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), the uncertainty surrounding the automotive sector — combined with the sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum — is having a substantial impact,” Desjardins said in a note, resulting in a change in the motor vehicles and parts sector vulnerability to “highly negative impact” from “likely limited impact.” It wasn’t all bad news as Desjardins upgraded the status of several other sectors including aerospace products and parts. Florence Jean-Jacobs, principal economist, and analyst Samuel Turcotte, said aerospace “stands out” and has “proven more resilient than expected” as a result of multiple tariff exemptions. Trump is threatening tariffs on other industries such as pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. “This is compounded by the many uncertainties surrounding the 2026 CUSMA review,” Jean-Jacobs and Turcotte said. - Today’s data: Canada manufacturing and wholesale sales.U.S. retail sales and business inventories. - Today’s earnings: MDA Space Ltd., George Weston Ltd., Artis Real Estate Investment Trust When a long-term relationship ends, predictable routines vanish and emotional upheaval and stacks of paperwork often arrive at the same time.

"Many Canadians are still avoiding travel to the United States after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs to protect his own nation. CTV News reported Wednesday that “the number of Canadian residents who returned by car from the U.S. fell to 1.4 million in October, a 30.5 per cent drop from the same period in 2024, according to preliminary data from Statistics Canada.” It was the tenth straight month of lower numbers, and the numbers of returning home via air travel dropped 24 percent, the outlet noted, adding that many people are choosing to travel overseas instead of to the United States. Canadians’ decision not to visit the United States had an effect on air and land travel, Breitbart News reported in February, and highlighted the fact that Trump in January was readying to impose fresh tariffs on U.S. trade partners. WATCH — Tariff Distributions? Trump Says $2,000 Dividends Will Be Issued: “White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that a 25-percent tariff will be placed on goods from Mexico and Canada, while Chinese imports will face a 10-percent duty. The move, she said, is aimed at holding these countries accountable for their role in drug trafficking and securing fairer trade terms for American workers,” Breitbart News’s John Carney wrote. Months later, Trump said the United States would put a 35 percent tariff on goods coming from Canada. “Trump criticized Canada for retaliating over earlier tariffs on Canadian goods that the Trump administration imposed when it found Canada was not cooperating in preventing fentanyl from coming into the U.S.,” the Breitbart News article explained. In October, the president said the U.S. would impose an additional 10 percent tariff on Canadian imports after it aired a deceptive advertisement featuring former President Ronald Reagan: President Donald Trump charged that Canada was “caught, red handed” using manipulated clips of Ronald Reagan in an anti-tariff advertisement broadcast during the World Series. The advertisement, produced by the government of Ontario, featured Reagan appearing to denounce tariffs, prompting an immediate response from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney later apologized to Trump for the advertisement. COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"NAPA, Calif. – Tariffs on imported products are creating widespread challenges for the U.S. wine industry, affecting both imports and domestic production, according to industry representatives. ""Tariffs are a multilayered issue,"" said Dawson Hobbs, executive vice president of government affairs at the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America. ""The most direct one people think of is the tariffs placed on imported wine. But there are hidden aspects too, tariffs on glass, aluminum cans, labels, even glue that holds boxes together. These universal tariffs affect the entire production process and supply chain."" Wholesalers, who buy products from producers or importers and sell them to retailers, also face increased costs. Holding inventory becomes more expensive as carrying costs rise, and those costs either need to be recouped when selling to retailers or absorbed. ""When our cost goes up, our carrying cost, the cost of the product sitting in our warehouse, goes up as well,"" Hobbs said. ""It really creates a challenge for the whole industry and supply chain."" TRUMP SAYS TARIFFS CRITICAL TO NATIONAL SECURITY AS SUPREME COURT PREPARES LANDMARK DECISION The on-again, off-again nature of tariff announcements adds another layer of difficulty. The Trump administration first threatened 200% tariffs against European wine imports in the spring, before settling on 15%. ""At the beginning of the year, there were tariffs threatened, then delayed, then implemented. When products take 60 to 70 days to arrive, it’s very difficult to plan when you don’t know what the tariff rate will be,"" Hobbs told Fox. Hobbs warned that rising costs could soon affect consumers more directly. ""Many companies have tried to absorb the cost, but as we near the end of this year and into the beginning of next year, consumers will start to see the impact on shelf prices,"" he said. SUPREME COURT WEIGHS TRUMP TARIFF POWERS IN BLOCKBUSTER CASE Tariffs can affect American producers indirectly, when many components involved in wine production come from overseas. ""American wines are certainly feeling tariffs in terms of inputs, aluminum cans, glass, cardboard, glue,"" Hobbs said. ""But overall, it creates more headwinds for the industry and does not help anyone with the final experience for the consumer."" Lucia Hossfeld, co-owner of Hossfeld Vineyards with her husband, said they are feeling the effects of tariffs on the winemaking side of the business. ""French oak barrels, the glass bottles, the cork. We’ve also seen consolidation, the labeling of the wine, as well as the selling of the wine. We’ve seen kind of retaliatory tariffs,"" Hossfeld said. It is often difficult to source some of the needed materials in the United States, she explained. Other times, certain imported materials are necessary for the type of wine they make. VINEYARD OWNERS USE GOSPEL OF JOHN METAPHOR TO GUIDE WINEMAKING PHILOSOPHY Over the last 18 months, costs have risen around 20%, largely due to inflation and labor costs, but tariffs implemented earlier this year have also added to higher operational expenses. Hossfeld said they’re working with trade partners to absorb costs and keep prices stable. ""On the supplier end, our barrel company, they’re making concessions, you know, splitting the cost with us,"" Hossfeld said. Similarly to domestic winemakers, Hobbs said many wholesalers are also absorbing the cost of tariffs, but he warned it’s not a sustainable solution.

Most people that you talk to do believe you will start seeing real price increases, unfortunately, as we near Christmas, and as we get into the first of the year,"" Hobbs said.",right
"Switzerland to boost US investment as deal struck to lower US tariffs on Swiss goods to 15% GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland announced plans on Friday to invest $200 billion in the United States through 2028 as it finalized a hard-wrought deal to slash U.S. tariffs on Swiss goods. Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said the Trump administration has agreed to cut U.S. tariffs on most Swiss goods to 15% — the same level imposed on the neighboring European Union — from 39%, the highest rate on any Western country. Speaking to reporters in Bern, the capital, Parmelin hailed the deal as a result of “new momentum generated by the commitment of the American president” and said it would take “several weeks” to take effect. The White House confirmed the deal Friday, adding that companies from Switzerland and tiny Liechtenstein would invest $67 billion of the $200 billion in the United States next year. “These investments will create thousands of well-paying American jobs across all 50 states in a number of sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, machinery, medical devices, aerospace, construction, advanced manufacturing, gold manufacturing, and energy infrastructure,” said a White House fact sheet. The U.S. consistently runs a deficit — more than $38 billion last year — in the trade of goods with Switzerland. The White House said “this deal with Switzerland will put us on a path to eliminate that deficit by 2028.” Earlier, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on CNBC that Switzerland would move manufacturing of some pharmaceuticals, gold smelting and railway equipment to the United States. The reduction in U.S. tariffs comes months after the Trump administration raised tariffs on Swiss goods from an initial 31% announced in April — part of the “Liberation Day” tariffs on scores of countries — to 39% on July 31. That sparked a quick and sustained push from Switzerland’s government and business leaders to bring them down — efforts that had been fruitless until Friday’s announcement. Switzerland is already a top foreign investor in the U.S. The $200 billion in Swiss investment will involve the private sector _ what Parmelin called “Team Switzerland” cooperating with government. It wasn’t immediately clear whether that was all new investment: Pharma giant Roche announced a $50 billion investment as the tariff tensions emerged. Some Swiss goods, notably in the pharmaceuticals, chemicals, gold and semiconductor industries, had already been exempted from the 39% rate, which had threatened to put Swiss goods at a massive disadvantage to competitors from the EU and beyond. The U.S. will also suspend extra tariffs on other goods deemed “important” such as in aviation, but those on other sectors such as industrial machinery, watches, coffee and cheese will continue, Parmelin said. Switzerland will continue to try to lower the tariffs on those, he said. The deal comes after a month-long diplomatic courtship by top Swiss officials, who deployed high-level teams to Washington, including missions led by President Karin Keller-Sutter and Parmelin. Last week, a half-dozen top executives from leading Swiss companies including Rolex, gold refining company MKS Pamp, and luxury group Richemont met with Trump at the Oval Office to press the Swiss case. ___ Associated Press reporters Michelle Price and Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report.

"OECD recommends Canada reform supply management policy A report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says Canada should gradually reduce the price support it provides to dairy, poultry and egg producers and focus on long-term climate adaptation for the agricultural sector. The “Agricultural Policy Monitoring and Evaluation 2025” document released last week looks at 54 countries around the world and offers specific recommendations. In the chapter dedicated to Canada, the OECD notes government support for the agricultural sector made up 8.2 per cent of gross farm receipts, a measure of revenue, between 2022 and 2024 and that level has been stable over the past decade. That’s less than half the level of two decades earlier and below the OECD average of 13.2 per cent. However, the report points to outsized support in a few sectors — dairy, poultry and eggs — that it argues distorts production and trade, and inflates domestic prices. Canada’s supply management policy controls production and imports of those products to prevent big price swings. It’s been one of the flashpoints in Canada-U.S. trade turmoil this year. “These forms of protection hinder market responsiveness and discourage innovation in those sectors,” the OECD said in its report. “Reforms should be undertaken, involving larger production quotas and gradual reduction of price support for greater efficiency and diversification into higher value products.” The report noted Canada’s average tariff rate on agricultural products was 14.4 per cent, well above 2.2 per cent for non-agricultural products. Canada can in theory charge tariffs of about 250 per cent on U.S. dairy imports over a set quota under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade agreement. But a U.S. dairy industry group has said that country has never come close to reaching that threshold. Also in the report, the OECD said climate action “remains a key challenge for Canada’s agriculture,” noting that sector is largely exempt from the country’s emissions pricing schemes. “As the frequency of weather-related adverse events increases, short-term risk management, already well developed, and medium-term support for resilient practices and innovation need to be complemented with more transformative longer-term strategies,” it said. “Resources could be directed toward improving the long-term adaptive capacity of farmers and transforming production systems, alongside monitoring implementation progress in adaptation policy.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 3, 2025.

"Canada to Add New Tariffs to US Steel, Curb Foreign Imports Canada will add new tariffs to a list of steel derivative products, including many US-made items, as Prime Minister Mark Carney seeks to protect an industry badly hurt by the trade war and a flood of cheap Chinese metal. (Bloomberg) — Canada will add new tariffs to a list of steel products, including many US-made items, as Prime Minister Mark Carney seeks to protect an industry badly hurt by the trade war and a flood of cheap Chinese metal. Carney announced the new 25% levy on steel derivative products Wednesday as part of a suite of measures to help producers. The tariff will apply starting Dec. 26 to about C$10 billion ($7.1 billion) of imported products including wind towers, prefabricated buildings, fasteners and wires. About 40% of the items on the list are typically brought in from the US, a Canadian government official said in a background briefing. It marks the first time Carney has added new import taxes to US products since he dropped most of Canada’s retaliatory tariffs in September. A broad 25% tariff on US steel and aluminum remains, and the prime minister has resisted calls to match US President Donald Trump’s 50% levy on those metals. “This is an encouraging leap forwards. We’ve been advocating for a lot of these things for many months,” said Keanin Loomis, head of the Canadian Institute of Steel Construction. “The Prime Minister has a much firmer grasp on this file than he did a few months ago.” Carney has struck a conciliatory tone with Trump for months in an effort to reach a deal to lower US tariffs on key sectors. But Trump called off the talks on Oct. 23 after he was angered by an Ontario government anti-tariff ad, and it appears unlikely the negotiations will resume anytime soon. The prime minister also said he would extend a timeline — for the final time — for companies to apply for tariff relief on steel they import from the US to use in manufacturing, food packaging and agriculture. After Jan. 31, firms will no longer be able to seek so-called “tariff remission” for those uses. At a news conference, Carney said the moves were not intended to put pressure on the Trump administration. “It’s not targeted at the US,” he said. “It’s a global approach, which is creating some space for Canadian steel producers to fill it.” Washington-Bound The prime minister confirmed he plans to travel to Washington on Dec. 5 for the 2026 World Cup draw, which will put him in the same room as Trump for the first time in about a month. Carney also said he spoke with the president on Tuesday, though he added the exchange was “not newsworthy.” Trade talks with the US have not resumed, he said, while Canada stands “ready to re-engage.” Carney also announced plans to lower the tariff-rate quota level for steel imports from countries with which Canada doesn’t have a trade agreement. Tariffs will now kick in when shipments from those nations hit 20% of last year’s levels — down from 50%. For countries that do have trade agreements with Canada, such as South Korea, the government will start applying tariffs when shipments hit 75% of 2024 levels. Previously, that was 100%. But that particular rule doesn’t apply to the US and Mexico. Lumber Aid As well, the government will add C$500 million to a loan program administered by the Business Development Bank of Canada to help companies in the softwood lumber business. It will also earmark C$500 million under the Large Enterprise Tariff Loan facility to support firms in the sector. In an effort to boost domestic sales in both industries, the government will provide funds to Canadian National Railway Co. and Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd. so they can offer a 50% discount on shipments of steel and lumber within Canada. Carney also plans to top up a program that provides benefits to employees who agree with their employers to work reduced hours, due to a decrease in business activity. The government will earmark more than C$100 million over two years to help up to 26,000 workers in various sectors. In addition, the prime minister pledged to implement his government’s Buy Canada policy later this year, requiring that all defense and construction contracts worth more than C$25 million prioritize Canadian materials, including steel and lumber. It will also apply across federal grants and contribution programs. He also promised a task force to examine how the forest industry can maintain its competitiveness over the long-term. Canadian steel companies that export to the US market have been crushed by the Trump administration’s 50% tariff on an array of foreign-made steel and aluminum products. The Canadian and Ontario governments recently extended an emergency loan to Algoma Steel Group Inc., an Ontario producer that’s highly exposed to the problem. The main steel industry group in Canada has been asking for the government to erect a higher tariff wall, to prevent foreign steel producers that no longer have easy access to the US from simply dumping the metal into the Canadian market. —With assistance from Mario Baker Ramirez, Ilya Banares, Jacob Lorinc and Melissa Shin.

"Trump tariff cut may ease pain for U.S. coffee and beef lovers Fears of shortages in the U.S. market had pushed futures prices higher and now some relief is expected United States President Donald Trump’s decision to remove a key tariff on Brazilian coffee and beef may deliver some relief to markets and American consumers who have struggled with soaring prices for the key staples. Brazil is the top global supplier of both commodities, and a 40 per cent tariff announced in July caused shipments into the U.S. to slump. The resulting supply squeeze had aggravated a price surge for consumers already facing decades-high food inflation. The executive order signed by Trump on Thursday is expected to ease that pressure. Last week, he cut a separate 10 per cent duty off those products. “Two-thirds of American adults drink coffee each day, and every cup will cost less thanks to President Trump’s decision to remove tariffs on coffee imports from Brazil,” the National Coffee Association said in a statement. The decision, which includes a basket of commodities, reflects the need to bring down prices for food, as Americans have struggled under the strain of high grocery bills and given Trump increasingly poor marks over his handling of the economy. Futures for the premium arabica coffee dropped as much as 6.6 per cent to an almost two-month low in New York on Friday. Prices had risen to a record high in October as tariffs added to a shortage caused by lackluster harvests across the globe. An inflation index for roasted coffee surged to an all-time high in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “We expect exports to resume,” said StoneX analyst Fernando Maximiliano. Fears of a shortage in the U.S. market had pushed futures prices higher and now some relief is expected, he added. Beef, meanwhile, has been a particularly thorny issue for the Trump administration, as consumer prices have soared to records amid a shrinking domestic cattle herd. The U.S. has increasingly relied on foreign shipments to fill the gap, helping to send cattle prices diving on expectations for an influx. But Brazilian beef shipments have fallen sharply following tariff threats. - Trump's Canada envoy sees trade talks resuming after sudden halt - Coffee gains as Brazilian stocks in exchange warehouses shrink - Advertisement 1Story continues below Live cattle futures dropped as much as 3.4 per cent on Friday, to the lowest since June. Still, cheaper costs for meat producers aren’t yet translating to less expensive beef for consumers, as demand has kept prices elevated. For Brazil, the impact of tariffs has been somewhat muted as the country was able to keep beef exports to all countries on the rise this year. Lower sales to the U.S. were offset by higher shipments to other destinations including Mexico and China. “Those who ended up being harmed more than anyone by the tariff were the American producers and consumers,” said Marcos Jank, a senior professor at Insper. Low beef availability in many other regions meant Brazil could find other markets for its product, he added. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Lutnick Is Using Metals Tariffs as Leverage Over the EU Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick went to Brussels this week with a refreshingly direct message: if Europe wants relief from American steel and aluminum tariffs, it will have to ease up on its regulatory and tax assault on U.S. technology companies. Notice the straightforwardness of this offer. There’s no need for elaborate moral framing or appeals to “shared values.” Just a simple transaction: we have something you want, you have something we want—let’s make a deal. This is what the real-world application of President Donald Trump’s governing philosophy looks like. This is what trade policy is when Washington finally puts American economic interests first. This is how adults discuss deals among themselves. The context is simple. Since the July trade agreement set a fifteen percent baseline tariff on most EU goods, European manufacturers have been hemorrhaging sales in the U.S. market. Steel and aluminum face a hefty 50 percent tariff—and that rate also applies to the metals components of goods containing European steel and aluminum. German Economy Minister Katherina Reiche admitted that “many machines that have been produced can’t be delivered to the U.S., and our companies are suffering from considerable declines in sales.” The pain is real, and it’s accelerating. Europe wants tariff relief badly. Lutnick made clear they can have it so long as they reform what he correctly called a “regulatory chokehold” on American tech firms and resolve legacy cases such as the nearly €3 billion penalty facing Google. Importantly, Lutnick wasn’t offering relief from the fifteen percent baseline tariff. His offer was targeted: roll back the steel and aluminum tariffs—and the tariffs on products that contain them—if Europe reins in its digital protectionism. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick arrives for an EU Trade Ministers meeting at the EU Council headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on November 24, 2025. (Thierry Monasse/Getty Images) Europe’s Digital Services Protectionism The elegance of Lutnick’s move is that it treats regulatory policy the way it actually functions: as a tradable instrument, not a sacred artifact. European officials played their predictable role. A Commission spokesperson insisted the EU has a “sovereign right to legislate.” Trade chief Maroš Šefčovič solemnly claimed the rules are “not discriminatory” and “not aimed at American companies.” Fine. Europe has every right to regulate however it likes inside its borders. And the United States has every right to maintain tariffs that make European manufacturers uncompetitive. The question is not about abstract rights but about relative priorities: What does Europe value more? The numbers make the answer embarrassing. The Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) enacted by France, the UK, Italy, Spain, and Austria generate perhaps $3–4 billion a year in total. France and the UK each pull in around $1.1 billion. Italy collects roughly $530 million. These figures look large until you realize they amount to rounding errors in national budgets—DST revenues typically come in below 0.5 percent of tax receipts. France’s DST accounts for just 0.22 percent of all French tax revenue. If revenue were the real goal, Europe would design these taxes very differently. Policymakers would tax digital commerce broadly, or all high-profit firms, or all companies above a certain size. Instead, the 2018 EU DST proposal deliberately carved out thresholds—€750 million global revenue and €50 million EU digital revenue—precisely to capture the U.S. giants and exclude smaller European competitors. The taxes apply to gross revenue, not profits, and only in sectors where American companies dominate: online advertising, digital marketplaces, and user data. In other words, this is protectionism disguised as tax policy. And it’s protectionism that hurts Europe itself. The DSTs were supposed to “punish” Big Tech, but the companies simply passed the costs on. Google added a two percent “DST fee” in the UK, five percent in Austria and Turkey, and three percent in France and Spain—specifically to cover DST costs. Amazon raised seller fees by two percent in the UK and implemented similar increases elsewhere. Apple hiked developer commissions. In practice, European advertisers, merchants, app developers, and consumers are the ones footing the bill. So, Europe collects pocket change from its own businesses while forgoing what Lutnick estimates could be “hundreds of billions, possibly $1 trillion of investment,” along with “a point and a half” of GDP growth. Even if those projections are optimistic, the gap between what Europe is fighting for (0.2 percent of tax revenue) and what it is giving up is staggering. Why cling to a policy so obviously self-defeating? Because the point is not revenue. It’s patronage. DST regimes serve as protectionist gifts to influential domestic technology companies, market shelters designed to slow down more competitive American firms. They sit alongside the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, and a long series of massive antitrust cases that almost exclusively ensnare American companies. Brussels can claim neutrality, but when nearly all the regulated firms are American, neutrality becomes performance art. Lutnick’s Trade Jujitsu This is why Lutnick’s linkage of steel tariffs and digital regulation is sophisticated statecraft. He’s not pretending the issues are philosophically connected. He’s applying the basic logic of negotiation: you care about your manufacturers, and we care about our tech companies. Let’s trade. (We’re still protecting our manufacturers with at least the 15 percent tariff on imports.) When a trading partner uses targeted taxes to handicap your firms, you respond by putting their real economic interests on the table. The truly brilliant part is that this strategy splits Europe’s own special interests. It forces Brussels to confront the fact that the DSTs were designed to shield Europe’s struggling tech sector—yet those same taxes now threaten the far more politically powerful manufacturing sector. Lutnick has exposed the tradeoff: Europe can keep its penalties on U.S. tech companies to protect a weak domestic tech industry, or it can reopen access to the U.S. market for its heavy-duty manufacturers. It cannot have both. And note the broader context: DSTs were supposed to be temporary, pending an OECD global tax agreement. That deal has been postponed over and over, first to the end of 2023, then mid-2024, now indefinitely. Europe has shown no sign of removing DSTs absent a global deal. France has even floated doubling its DST rate from three to six percent if the OECD process collapses. Like most “temporary” taxes, these measures are becoming permanent precisely because they are politically useful. Lutnick has forced Europe to confront the real tradeoff. Brussels can preserve its “sovereign right” to impose protectionist digital taxes and regulations. Or it can have the steel and aluminum deal. But it cannot have both. Washington has finally made the choice clear. Now Europe has to decide whether protecting tiny, politically convenient revenue streams is worth sacrificing the health of its own industrial base. Lutnick is treating Europe’s barriers the way they deserve to be treated: as obstacles to be bargained away rather than abstract principles to be respected.

"The first phase of the proposed India-US bilateral trade agreement (BTA) is 'nearing closure' and would address the hefty 50 per cent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Indian goods, in addition to resolving America's market access issues, a government official said on Monday. The US has imposed a 25 per cent reciprocal tariffs and another 25 per cent on Indian goods entering American markets for buying Russian crude oil. ""We are engaged with the US on the BTA. It has two parts. One part of negotiations will take time. The other part is a package which can address reciprocal tariffs. We are working on both aspects.

This is in the overall context of keeping the trade with the US. It is not part of any negotiations package per se but definitely as part of our endeavour to balance trade with the US.""

"Air Canada ramps up flights at home, overseas as travellers shun U.S. MONTREAL — Air Canada has cemented a pivot away from the U.S. as Canadians continue to shun their neighbour amid the trade war, all as the company recovers from a summer strike that cost it hundreds of millions of dollars. The country’s largest airline ramped up flights at home and in Europe, the Caribbean and Latin America in response to travellers’ renewed interest in domestic and overseas trips. “We mitigated the exposure to reduced demand between Canada and the U.S. In Q3 we quickly responded to Canadians’ growing interest to travel domestically,” chief commercial officer Mark Galardo told analysts on a conference call Wednesday. “Sun and Latin American markets remain solidly ahead of last year for winter, with a robust advanced booking position from Air Canada Vacations.” “The transborder sector remains stable, albeit at lower levels,” he said of Canada-U.S. travel. Total capacity will nudge up this year, the company said, even as demand for U.S. flights stays weak. The carrier’s transborder flight volumes fell 10 per cent year-over-year in September, according to aviation data tracker Cirium. The decline reflects a backlash to the tariff spat sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump as well as a relatively low Canadian dollar and fears around immigration enforcement in the U.S. On the plus side, the dearth of competitors on cross-border routes means Air Canada will enjoy a “much more favourable revenue environment” starting next year, said National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen. Meanwhile, the airline’s flight volumes rose three per cent domestically, five per cent for Europe and 20 per cent for the Caribbean in September. For Latin America, capacity is poised to increase 22 per cent by December, figures from Cirium show. A second hurdle sits in the rear-view mirror, leaving a dent in Air Canada’s income statement. A three-day strike by more than 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants in August shut down operations, caused more than 3,000 flight cancellations and cost the airline $375 million, the company said earlier this fall. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, revenue fell more than five per cent year-over-year to $5.77 billion due to the strike, which included $90 million in reimbursements to customers, chief financial officer John Di Bert said. Net income in the third quarter — typically the company’s most lucrative — dropped 87 per cent to $264 million from $2.04 billion in the same quarter last year. Air Canada also cut about 400 management jobs to lighten its cost load after the financial hit. On Tuesday, it narrowed its adjusted earnings forecast to between $2.95 billion and $3.05 billion compared with the $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion it predicted in September. To recoup some cash, the airline is banking on steady corporate travel and a growing appetite for “premium” seats _ larger ones with more legroom and enhanced services such as priority boarding and better meals. “Demand is strong. In particular, business travel continues to recover,” said Di Bert. Chief executive Michael Rousseau suggested Prime Minister Mark Carney’s push to expand trade in regions ranging from Asia to Europe would prove strong enough to bolster the airline’s sales. “We think we can play a big part in that diversification. Strategically bringing in wide-bodies will allow us to work with Canada on diversifying trade,” he said, referring to a fleet shuffle that plunks bigger planes onto transatlantic routes. Air Canada expects to add two Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets by the end of 2026, on top of more than three dozen narrow-body planes in a long-awaited fleet renewal. Nonetheless, the carrier will have about a dozen fewer aircraft on any given month in 2026 due to delivery delays, hampering its capacity, Di Bert said. RBC Dominion Securities analyst James McGarragle pointed to weaker-than-expected margins and capacity forecasted for 2026, with other cost pressures including an updated labour deal with flight attendants, airport infrastructure fees and other inflationary pressures. On an adjusted basis, the Montreal-based company on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings of 75 cents per diluted share, down from $2.57 per diluted share in the same quarter last year and well below analysts’ expectations of 95 cents per share, according to financial markets firm LSEG Data & Analytics.

"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released new projections showing that recent rollbacks of President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy have wiped out roughly $800 billion in expected debt reduction over the next decade. This revision comes even as tariffs remain a central point of debate in U.S. fiscal policy, particularly with the national debt exceeding $38 trillion and deficit reduction an urgent concern for lawmakers and economists alike. According to the CBO’s updated baseline budget projections, the expected impact of tariff policy on U.S. deficits has fallen sharply since its last projections on tariff revenue in August. At that point, an effective tariff rate of 20.5% implied future deficit reduction of $3.3 trillion through 2035, and about $700 billion in interest savings. However, since June, the scope and magnitude of these tariffs have shifted significantly. The administration’s decision to pull back or soften tariffs on a range of imports—particularly with key trading partners like China and the European Union—in response to mounting trade tensions and retaliatory measures has dramatically altered the fiscal outlook. The CBO now estimates that the resulting fiscal benefits of tariffs have been substantially eroded, as an effective tariff rate of 16.5% implies $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction and $500 billion in interest savings. Political and economic forces drive shifts The CBO points out that these substantial debt-reduction projections are highly sensitive to the fate of tariff policy—a policy area marked by political volatility and economic uncertainty. Trump initially touted tariffs as a tool to bring down the ballooning federal debt and, as recently as August, claimed that the policies would generate revenue far exceeding government projections. The CBO calculated reduced tariffs from five separate announcements with various trading partners, announced between early September and early November. They consisted of tweaks to the agreement with Japan, with the EU, on auto vehicles and parts, with India, and with China. The CBO didn’t even include another pending tariff reduction important to Americans’ pocketbooks. After stinging off-year election losses for Republicans in early November, when Democrats won 18 out of 18 races nationwide in which they were on the ballot, Trump moved in the middle of the month to scrap several tariffs linked to affordability concerns. “We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods like coffee,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, hours after the tariff rollback was announced. Trump had signed an executive order hours earlier, removing tariffs on tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes, and certain fertilizers. At the same time, Trump has struggled to admit that Democrats’ affordability arguments are real. The day after his tariff rollback, he said on social media that “Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems. It is a complete CON JOB. Thanksgiving costs are 25% lower this year than last, under Crooked Joe! We are the Party of Affordability!” That seemed to be a reference to a particular Walmart meal deal that has half as many items as 2024. Stubborn debt and lingering risks The erosion of tariff-driven deficit reduction comes amid worsening Congressional gridlock over broader fiscal policy. The Treasury Department reports the U.S. national debt currently exceeds $38 trillion, a figure that continues to grow despite years of political promises to rein it in. The CBO notes that even the most ambitious tariff projections would have barely dented the debt’s steep trajectory—but now, even those incremental benefits are slipping away. Economists caution that while tariffs can generate significant government revenue in the short term, their wider economic effects—such as higher consumer prices, supply chain disruptions, and lower growth—could ultimately offset the initial fiscal gains. Indeed, some independent analysts contend that the CBO’s calculations may not fully account for longer-term economic headwinds caused by ongoing trade disputes.",right
"Good morning. Amid persistent economic headwinds and shifting trade policy, e.l.f. Beauty is finding opportunity in constraint. The company’s focus on affordability continues to win over consumers, even as shoppers grow more selective, according to CFO Mandy Fields. “We’re still a value to our consumers when people are pulling back and being more choiceful with their spending,” Fields told me. Even after a recent $1 price increase, 75% of e.l.f. Beauty’s products remain priced at $10 or less, she said. “If a shopper only has $20 to spend, e.l.f. is a great option,” Fields said. “You can still come in, buy a couple of products, and still have money left in your pocketbook. That’s exactly where we want to be for our consumers.” A longtime favorite among Gen Z, e.l.f. Beauty, a multi-brand beauty company, is also gaining traction with millennials and Gen X as the brand doubles down on value and trend-driven innovation. Last week, e.l.f. Beauty reported results for the three and six months ended September 30. Quarterly net sales rose 14% to $343.9 million from $301.1 million a year earlier—slightly below analyst expectations. After choosing not to issue full-year guidance last quarter, the company now forecasts fiscal 2026 revenue between $1.55 billion and $1.57 billion, representing 18%–20% growth. Analysts had expected closer to $1.65 billion. Even so, adjusted earnings of $0.68 per share topped consensus estimates of $0.57. The company’s category-leading growth has now extended across 27 consecutive quarters, CEO Tarang Amin said in the company’s earnings release. Tackling tariffs through diversification One of the biggest challenges ahead: tariffs. The company expects more than $50 million in additional annual costs tied to higher U.S. tariffs in fiscal 2026. According to Fields, e.l.f. Beauty’s weighted average tariff rate has surged to about 60% this year, up from 25% last year. Roughly 75% of e.l.f.’s production is based in China. To mitigate the impact, Fields said the company is using a mix of price adjustments, supply chain diversification, and international expansion. The recent $1 price increase was one lever, and the company is also aggressively sourcing outside of China and growing sales in markets where tariffs don’t apply, she explained. Innovation as a constant Even amid macro pressure, e.l.f. Beauty continues to innovate, Fields said. That pipeline now includes new momentum from the Rhode acquisition. Announced in May, e.l.f. Beauty agreed to acquire Hailey Bieber’s Rhode lifestyle brand for $800 million in cash and stock, plus a potential $200 million earnout tied to performance over the next three years. Rhode is helping fuel the company’s forecast for 18%–20% annual revenue growth—among the strongest in the beauty industry, Fields commented. There’s also significant white space internationally: only 20% of e.l.f. Beauty’s sales currently come from outside the U.S., compared with roughly 70% for major competitors, she said. The company is building scale in skincare with Naturium, Rhode, and e.l.f. Skin, whose supply chains are primarily based in the U.S., Europe, and South Korea. Adapting the CFO Playbook For Fields, leading through volatility comes down to agility. “We choose words of the year here at e.l.f., and the word of the year was flourish,” Fields said. “Just going through this period of time where we’ve had to do so many scenarios, and you get so many things thrown at you, how do you continue to focus on flourishing as a company?” What she’s learned this year is that no matter what is going on around you—“Continue to keep your eye on growth.” Staying close to digital innovation and working to integrate AI across the enterprise is also top of mind. Despite tariffs, inflation, and evolving consumer behavior, Fields remains focused on the fundamentals. “We still have a lot of growth ahead of us,” she said. “We still have aspirations to be the No. 1 color cosmetics brand.

"Are Thanksgiving grocery prices really cheaper this year? The White House is putting affordability front and center this holiday season, emphasizing that certain Thanksgiving essentials are cheaper than they were a year ago. Even with government data showing grocery trips still cost 2.7% more than last year, officials argue that key savings are helping ease the strain on family budgets. At the top of their list is Walmart’s Thanksgiving meal basket, which they say is 25% cheaper than last year. The list is made up of fewer products and lower-cost brands, but the administration still points to it as a sign of improving affordability. Egg prices are also down sharply, nearly 90%, this is largely due to fewer bird flu outbreaks affecting supply, as per a report by WCVB. ALSO READ: Is Cyber Monday happening today?

Eggs have seen the most dramatic drop, and Walmart’s limited-price Thanksgiving basket is another example the White House is using to show relief. But grocery inflation hasn’t disappeared.

But we have to decide how important that product is to it and what the appetite is for our customer,” she said. “More often, we kind of meet in the middle and try to take a little hit on our margin to make it more palatable.” How are tariffs affecting grocery bills? Tariffs continue to push prices higher on a range of imported foods. President Donald Trump recently reduced tariffs on beef, coffee, and tropical fruit, acknowledging that tariffs “may have raised prices,” though he argued that import taxes generally do not impact consumer prices, as per a report by WCVB. Beef, however, is still at record highs. Agricultural economist Michael Swanson noted that the effect of tariff changes depends on the type of beef, since much of what’s used in ground beef is imported and may still face tariffs.

"Listen to this article in summarized format Related Speaking to ET Now, Arora said MSCI India has risen 5.5% in the past two months, even as China has fallen 6%, emerging markets are up just 1.8% and the US markets have gained less than 2.5%. “In dollar terms, India is one of the best-performing markets right now,” he said. ‘Smallcaps will catch up: The turn has already happened’ The muted feeling among investors, Arora said, is because portfolios heavy in smallcaps haven’t yet reclaimed earlier peaks. But the broader market has already stabilised and reversed.“Our midcap fund launched in March is already up 30%. The midcap index is up 20% in the same period. The rally has happened — it’s just not visible if you compare with 2024 highs,” he noted. Arora believes broader participation will return once FIIs reduce selling pressure and domestic demand, boosted by reforms, begins to flow through. Reforms fuel the market: GST cuts, rate cuts, income-tax relief Arora attributes the market’s improving tone to the government’s recent reform push:- GST rate rationalisation - RBI rate cuts - Income-tax cuts - Tariff-related adjustments “These changes feed into consumer finances. They may not show up in a particular company’s earnings, but they strengthen the household balance sheet — and that supports the economy,” he explained. Why he’s avoiding exchanges and broker stocks Arora remains cautious on capital-market plays, particularly brokers, exchanges and depositories, despite BSE and MCX soaring in 2024.“Speculative volumes are too high. Regulators don’t like it. After Covid, trading volumes multiplied 10–15x — that’s unsustainable,” he cautioned.

"After months of legal battles and confusion in global markets, justices will hear arguments on whether Trump went too far in imposing broad import taxes. Small businesses, trade experts, and lawmakers are watching closely as the stakes stretch from Main Street to international markets. ALSO READ: What does 67 mean, who made the 67 meme and why is it so popular? The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments today on President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, a high-stakes case that could reshape presidential authority over international trade. The tariffs, which have been challenged in multiple courts, sparked economic uncertainty for small businesses and raised questions about the limits of executive power, as per a report by KCCI. Lower courts previously ruled that Trump overstepped in setting these trade duties, and now the nation’s highest court will determine whether those decisions stand. ALSO READ: Mass layoffs hit Amazon, UPS and Target, but the real reason has nothing to do with AI What sparked this Supreme Court review? At the center of the case are Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on most countries and additional import taxes tied to alleged foreign government involvement in drug trafficking. The administration relied on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the move. While the president enacted IEEPA last spring, critics argue the law does not explicitly authorize tariffs, as per a report by KCCI. Also read: Sorry, Zohran — here’s why Mamdani can’t legally run for President of the United States How is the law being interpreted? Trump’s team maintains that in emergency situations, IEEPA allows a president to regulate import taxes even though the statute does not include the word “tariff.” However, the Constitution assigns Congress the power to levy tariffs, and lower court rulings emphasized that IEEPA does not grant limitless executive authority.Why does the ruling matter for the economy? Trade analysts say uncertainty has weighed heavily on small businesses. According to federal data, the U.S. government collected about $195 billion in customs duties this year, more than double last year’s figure, highlighting the financial impact, as per a report by KCCI.ALSO READ: National Donut Day 2025: Top deals from Krispy Kreme and other outlets - go grab fast American University law professor Stephen Wermiel noted the urgency, saying, ""The need to figure out whether they are lawful and can continue or should be stopped, and what to do about it if they are stopped. I think the court certainly is recognizing that's a fairly urgent question."" In early Supreme Court arguments, a number of prominent conservative justices expressed strong skepticism toward President Donald Trump's lawyer regarding his expansive global tariffs, which could be concerning for the administration. Specifically, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett put a lot of pressure on the administration on a number of issues, such as whether the relevant statute permitted Trump to impose his emergency tariffs. Roberts disputed the administration's main points, arguing that the law's language, which gives the president the authority to ""regulate"" imports, might not be precise enough to support the import taxes. In the meantime, Barrett questioned Solicitor General D. John Sauer about whether the court had ever thought of the word ""regulate"" as encompassing sweeping tariffs. Justice Brett Kavanaugh also appeared dubious about one of the administration's historical defenses: that courts had allowed former President Richard Nixon to impose tariffs under a law that predated the one in question, as quoted in a report by CNN. A decision is expected anytime between now and July. FAQs Why is the Supreme Court hearing this case?Because lower courts ruled Trump overstepped his authority by setting tariffs without Congress. What’s at stake? The decision could redefine presidential power over tariffs and impact businesses facing higher import costs.

"CJI on '79 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment'NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance. Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs. 'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai ""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement. It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said. The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship. ""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution... However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said. ""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.",right
"A challenging external environment coupled with the continuing impact of tariffs is expected to keep future growth estimates subdued, according to a report by SBI Mutual Fund. However, the report stated that high-frequency indicators during the festive season have painted a more optimistic picture, especially with strong demand seen in high-value discretionary items such as automobiles and household appliances. It stated ""A challenging external environment coupled with the impact of tariffs was expected to keep future growth estimates subdued, however high frequency data for festive season... looks promising"" Financing activity in these segments has also remained robust, pointing to resilient consumer sentiment despite global headwinds. The report noted that the impact of the recent GST cuts is gradually working its way through the economy. Overall GST collections for the month of October were in line with expectations, indicating steady consumption momentum. On the inflation front, conditions remain supportive, with forward estimates anchored closer to the target level even as concurrent numbers continue to print lower. The report highlighted that the festive season, marked by strong demand but fewer working days in October, resulted in system liquidity tightening. This was primarily due to higher cash in circulation--an expected phenomenon during festive months--and possible intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the spot forex market, where the central bank may have supplied U.S. dollars while withdrawing Indian rupee liquidity. Consequently, overnight money market rates remained elevated with intermittent volatility. Even as the recent Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) cuts continue to transmit through the system, core liquidity has been steadily reducing. This trend, according to the report, has opened up expectations for potential Open Market Operations (OMOs) by the RBI in the fourth quarter to maintain adequate liquidity conditions. Looking ahead, the forward outlook on growth and inflation, along with evolving risk factors, suggests there is some room for further monetary support. The December monetary policy review is expected to remain ""live"" for what could possibly be the last rate cut in the current cycle. The report emphasized that despite ongoing debates about the effectiveness of additional rate cuts, the current macroeconomic context provides sufficient space to keep monetary and liquidity conditions supportive of growth.

"Japan's economy contracts as exports get hit by US tariffs TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s economy contracted at a 1.8% annual pace in July-September as President Donald Trump’s tariffs hit exports and private residential investment plunged. Data released by the government Monday showed that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, Japan’s gross domestic product, the sum value of its goods and services, slipped 0.4%, the first contraction in six quarters. The annualized rate shows what the economy would have done if the same rate were to continue for a year. In the April-June quarter, the Japanese economy grew 0.6% on quarter, while in the January-March period, it grew 0.2%.. Exports fell 4.5% in annual terms in the three months through September. As Trump implemented higher tariffs on imports from many countries earlier this year, businesses ramped up their exports to try to beat higher costs. That inflated some of the earlier data for exports. Imports for the third quarter slipped 0.1%. Private consumption edged up 0.1% during the quarter. Analysts said a 9.4% quarter-on-quarter drop in private residential investment, which translates to a 32.5% drop in annualized terms, was mainly due to revisions of Japan’s building code that caused housing starts to plunge after they took effect in April, the start of Japan’s fiscal year. Tariffs are a major blow to Japan’s export-reliant economy, led by powerful automakers like Toyota Motor Corp., although many manufacturers have moved production abroad to avert the impact from tariffs and other trade controls. The U.S. imposes a 15% tariff surcharge on nearly all Japanese imports. That’s down from Trump’s earlier plan for a 25% tariff. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office in October, has vowed to revive the economy and is expected to boost government spending, among other policies. That could complicate the central bank’s efforts to rein in inflation by raising interest rates from their longstanding level near zero. The lackluster level of activity in the last quarter means a possible rate hike in December is unlikely, Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a report. But initial data for this quarter and surveys of business sentiment suggest the economy may improve in coming months, and the Bank of Japan may resume raising interest rates early in 2026, he said. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.com/↕yurikageyama Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Trump tariffs faced tough questioning from a 9-justice bench during a 2Â½-hr-long hearing in the US Supreme Court on Wednesday. A ruling in favour of the Trump regime will require five votes - an unlikely outcome given the sentiments expressed by the justices during the hearing. Donald Trump has based his tariffs on a provision in the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which gives him a set of economic powers 'to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat'. The threat Trump has identified is the large trade deficit, which threatens US industries and, by implication, security. But the manner in which the president has chosen to exercise the power imparted by the emergency involves three potential violations of the US Constitution, noted by the justices during the Supreme Court hearing: Gorsuch expressed concern that the Supreme Court's interpretation of IEEPA as delegating so much power to the executive would make it difficult for Congress to regain that power. A related objection, raised by Justice Barrett, is to a worldwide tariff as a solution to the emergency. 'Is it your contention,' she asked rhetorically, 'that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the [US'] defence and industrial base?... I could see it with some countries, but explain to me why as many countries needed to be subject to the reciprocal tariff policy as are.' While the tenor of the majority of justices during the hearing suggests a verdict against Trump tariffs, the regime faces no immediate threat from it. The justices will now deliberate on the case and draft opinions. The earliest a ruling will come is spring 2026. But it's more likely to be pushed to June, when the court's session ends. The effect of the Supreme Court's ruling against Trump tariffs would be far-reaching. Most importantly, it will de facto nullify all trade and investment deals, since they hinge on the 10% across-the-board tariff, and other country-specific tariffs imposed under IEEPA powers. True, the Trump regime has the option to impose: 15% across-the-board tariff for up to 150 days to correct an imbalance in the external payments account under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 (never done before). Donald Trump has based his tariffs on a provision in the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which gives him a set of economic powers 'to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat'. The threat Trump has identified is the large trade deficit, which threatens US industries and, by implication, security. But the manner in which the president has chosen to exercise the power imparted by the emergency involves three potential violations of the US Constitution, noted by the justices during the Supreme Court hearing: - The authority to enact a revenue-raising measure, such as a tariff, in the US vests entirely in Congress. As Justice Amy Coney Barrett observed, though IEEPA allows POTUS to regulate imports, it doesn't authorise him to use the tariff for that purpose. As a revenue-raising measure, tariffs are the prerogative of Congress. Gorsuch expressed concern that the Supreme Court's interpretation of IEEPA as delegating so much power to the executive would make it difficult for Congress to regain that power. - Even if one grants that, under certain circumstances, Congress delegates the power to impose tariffs to the president through certain of its statutes, the extraordinarily broad scope of the tariffs in the present case triggers what is known as the 'major questions doctrine'. Invoking it, Chief Justice John Roberts noted that such a significant policy needed express authorisation from Congress. - The basis for the president's declaration of an emergency - the trade deficit - is itself questionable. For one thing, the current trade deficit has existed for half a century. It also existed for extended periods in the 19th c. As such, it's hardly an 'extraordinary threat'. Unsurprisingly, no past US president has invoked IEEPA based on it. A related objection, raised by Justice Barrett, is to a worldwide tariff as a solution to the emergency. 'Is it your contention,' she asked rhetorically, 'that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the [US'] defence and industrial base?... I could see it with some countries, but explain to me why as many countries needed to be subject to the reciprocal tariff policy as are.' While the tenor of the majority of justices during the hearing suggests a verdict against Trump tariffs, the regime faces no immediate threat from it.

The effect of the Supreme Court's ruling against Trump tariffs would be far-reaching. Most importantly, it will de facto nullify all trade and investment deals, since they hinge on the 10% across-the-board tariff, and other country-specific tariffs imposed under IEEPA powers. True, the Trump regime has the option to impose: - Temporary tariffs on specific goods from specific countries upon investigation for discriminatory trade practices under Section 301 of the same Act. - Tariffs on certain goods on national security grounds under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1962.

"President Donald Trump again suggested using tariff revenue to provide Americans with a “dividend,” though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it could come “in lots of forms.” On Sunday, Trump posted on Truth Social that opponents of his tariffs are “fools,” adding that the government is taking in trillions of dollars that will go toward paying down U.S. debt. “Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place,” he wrote. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.” Tariffs are expected to generate $300 billion-$400 billion annually. And over the next 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated they could produce $3.3 trillion in revenue. With such high hopes for a massive windfall, Trump has floated a tariff-related payment multiple times in the past. But his latest proposal came just days after his administration told the Supreme Court that tariffs are not meant to generate revenue. On ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday, Bessent said he’s not worried that Trump’s public statements are undercutting his arguments at the high court, which is considering a challenge to his global tariffs enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Treasury chief said tariffs are meant to rebalance trade, with revenue eventually shifting to domestic taxes as more high-paid manufacturing jobs come back to the U.S. He added that he hadn’t yet talked to Trump about the $2,000 dividend idea, which would require Congress to pass legislation. But Bessent also pointed to tax provisions that have already been signed into law in his tax-and-spending bill as sources of the dividend. “The $2,000 dividend could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways,” he explained. “You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president’s agenda. You know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security. Deductibility of auto loans. So, you know, those are substantial deductions that, you know, are being financed in the tax bill.” So Americans may not get a check in the mail. But Bessent’s suggestion that the dividend may not involve fresh allocations would also help sidestep difficult budget math. So much tariff revenue has been coming in that it’s helped keep budget deficits from getting much worse. But that assumes the revenue actually goes toward funding the federal government. Drawing on that money to instead pay for dividends would require the government to issue more debt. Trump’s social media post didn’t include additional details on the dividend. But Erica York, a tax policy expert at the Tax Foundation, attempted some back-of-the-envelope calculations. Assuming the cutoff for “high income” Americans is $100,000, then about 150 million adults would qualify for the dividend, putting the cost at nearly $300 billion, she posted on X, adding that the cost grows if children are also eligible. “The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,” York said. “Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump’s proposed $300 billion rebate.”",right
"""The government continues to work to mitigate the impact of the US tariff measures on Indian exports through a comprehensive multi-pronged strategy encompassing intensive engagement with the US government for a mutually beneficial India-US bilateral trade agreement,"" minister of state for commerce and industry, Jitin Prasada, said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. He said immediate relief has been given through trade relief measures of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the announcement of the credit guarantee scheme for exporters, enhancement of domestic demand through GST reforms, and negotiating free trade agreements (FTAs) with more countries. On July 31, the US issued an executive order with reciprocal tariff rates for its trading partners. The order notified country-specific additional ad-valorem duty rates for certain American trading partners, including those which have agreed to or are in the process of concluding trade agreements with them.",right
"On Wednesday during oral arguments, Supreme Court justices cast doubt on Trump's authority to impose tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which contains no references to tariffs - only language on regulating imports during national emergencies declared by the U.S. president. ""Based on the questions posed by the justices, the IEEPA tariffs appear to be in jeopardy,"" said Damon Pike, a principal with BDO USA's customs and trade services practice. He added that all the court's justices, except Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, ""seemed skeptical that IEEPA gives President Trump the power to levy unlimited tariffs on every product imported from every country around the world."" But Pike said if the Trump administration loses, it will simply invoke other trade laws, a view widely shared by trade lawyers, senior Trump administration officials, importing companies and analysts. These groups had just started to get used to the idea of a somewhat more stable trade environment, bolstered by a new year-long U.S.-China trade truce and more U.S. deals with southeast Asian countries that reduced the IEEPA tariff rates to more manageable levels. Companies have clamored for certainty and predictability on tariffs so that they can plan their investments, but Conference Board policy executive David Young said he did not see relief in sight. ""We've still got no clarity - CEOs remain kind of precariously positioned around what the future looks like,"" said Young, who briefed about 40 CEOs following the Supreme Court arguments. ""Even if it goes against IEEPA, the uncertainty still continues."" A ruling is unlikely before early 2026, Young said, and companies are totally in the dark about potential refunds of the more than $100 billion in IEEPA tariffs paid so far if Trump loses. POTENTIAL REFUNDS ""A MESS"" The issue of refunds was raised by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who said that it ""could be a mess"" for the courts to administer refunds to U.S. importers who have paid tariffs that were declared illegal.Neal Katyal, the lawyer representing five small businesses challenging the tariffs, said that these firms would get their refunds automatically if the court ruled against the Trump administration, but all other companies would have to lodge administrative protests to get money back. ""It's a very complicated thing"" that could take a long time, he added. But Katyal said the court ""could limit its decision to prospective relief"" by only stopping future collections. Joseph Spraragen, a customs lawyer in New York, said a ruling that includes no provisions for refunds would result in major new court challenges from companies that paid duties. ""If they're illegal today, they were illegal in February 2025 and in April, when the reciprocal tariffs kicked in,"" said Spraragen, a partner at the firm of Grunfeld Desiderio Lebowitz Silverman & Klestadt. He said the Supreme Court would likely remand the case to a lower court, most probably the U.S. Court of International Trade, to issue instructions to the Trump administration to rescind the tariffs and issue refunds. The most expedient method would be to issue refunds through the Customs and Border Protection's Automated Customs Environment processing system, he said, but that could take up to a year. ""Keep in mind that the administration is not going to be eager to just roll over and give refunds,"" Spraragen said. SHIFTS IN LAWS Natixis analyst Christopher Hodge said the ""bureaucratic complexity"" surrounding refunds was among a murky set of outcomes if the administration loses at the Supreme Court. Such a loss would only be a ""temporary setback to the Trump trade agenda,"" he said, as the administration would shift to trade laws that offer clear tariff authority, including Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a national security trade statute, and Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows temporary 15% duties for 150 days.""On the downside, this implementation process could be lengthy and prolong the uncertainty of trade policy,"" Hodge wrote earlier this week. ""It is possible that another round of trade talks would be on the docket for 2026 as well, adding to the cloudy outlook on trade."" On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran said there were potential monetary policy implications from a court decision against Trump that would ""increase uncertainty ... over the tariff environment."" Miran, who has argued for steep rate cuts, told Yahoo Finance in an interview that more trade uncertainty could become ""a drag on the economy."" But this could be offset by ""moderately looser interest rates"" depending on the status of the Fed's dual mandate for price stability and maximum employment, said Miran, who is on leave from his job as a Trump administration economist.

"Listen to this article in summarized format In an interview with ET Now, Shah said India currently has limited or no representation in the AI trade, but that may prove to be an advantage when the theme unwinds globally. “We have not participated in the global AI boom. But when that trend reverses, India could become a strong anti-AI allocation,” he said, adding that global investors could re-enter India if domestic earnings accelerate into double digits. Earnings upcycle may return soon India has been in an earnings downgrade cycle for nearly 15 months, with growth stuck in single digits. But Q2 FY25 marked a shift with 2–3% net earnings upgrades, driving broad market optimism.Shah believes the real acceleration will come in FY27: “Markets want consistency. FY27 has a better chance of delivering meaningful earnings outperformance,” he said. Will global uncertainty help India? Shah highlighted three global triggers that could reshape capital flows:1. Dollar devaluation Trump’s policies and global uncertainty are raising the risk of dollar debasement. A weaker dollar is already pushing up gold and commodity prices. “If even a fraction of the $30 trillion foreign holdings in US assets moves out, India will be a big beneficiary,” he said.2. Weakening of US institutions Shah expressed concern over the Federal Reserve’s eroding independence, saying institutional weakness could hurt investor confidence and prompt reallocations to emerging markets.3. Unjust US tariffs on India The current 25% tariff on select Indian exports — despite exemptions to countries like Poland — remains a key friction point.“If these tariffs go away, our growth could get an immediate boost,” Shah said. If tariffs continue, the RBI may step in with liquidity support and rate cuts. India’s domestic strength: The bigger story - Despite external uncertainty, India remains a structural growth story driven by reforms: - India is the fourth-largest global economy, fifth-largest manufacturer. - On an incremental basis, India contributes 8–9% to global GDP growth (18% on PPP terms). - Reforms by RBI, SEBI, IRDAI, PFRDA and pre-Budget initiatives are pushing for better ease of doing business and Atmanirbharta in strategic sectors. Government’s next steps Shah says the government must:- Continue pushing reforms to boost domestic demand. - End inspector raj, which hurts SMEs and even listed companies. - Use India’s large domestic market to open new export access globally. - Mitigate the impact of tariffs on sectors like gems, jewellery, textiles and aquaculture. What should investors do now? Shah says temporary corrections in India due to global AI unwinding may happen, but local fundamentals will ultimately prevail.“India remains a meaningful long-term play. Our ROE is strong, valuations have normalized, and once earnings hit double digits, flows will return.” (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

"- In today’s CEO Daily: Asia editor Nick Gordon reports on China’s robotics edge. - The big story: It’s Budget Day in the U.K. - The markets: In the black, globally. - Plus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune. Good morning. Earlier this month, an engineer at electric vehicle maker Xpeng cut open the company’s new humanoid robot to dispel social media rumors that the life-like creature was a real person. “They told me that many people were saying there was a real person hidden inside,” Xpeng CEO He Xiaopeng said in a video posted to Weibo. “It is absolutely a real robot, right?” he said after the robot’s “skin” and webbed “muscle” were slashed to reveal its inner machine. The viral stunt is the latest evidence of China’s growing strength in robotics, especially the humanoid kinds that can already dance en masse to Chinese music and box in a ring. Yet China’s strength in robotics goes beyond flashy spectacles. The country manufactures just over half the world’s industrial robots and installed more of them in its own operations last year than the rest of the world combined. Its innovation is as grand as the Baidu, WeRide and Pony.Ai self-driving cars zipping around Beijing, Shenzhen, Singapore, Abu Dhabi, and Barcelona and as humble as the robotic vacuum cleaner. Take Roborock. Founded by a group of Xiaomi-backed engineers in 2014, the Beijing-based company has quickly surged to take over the home robot vacuum market once dominated by iRobot and Roomba. It’s now the largest robot vacuum brand in the world. I recently talked to Roborock’s president, Quan Gang, about how China has managed to move so quickly in this space. “In China, we have a very comprehensive supply chain,” he explained, which helps make “design and production very easy, competent and efficient.” China’s intense competition is also driving robotics firms to upgrade fast. A company like iRobot might take two years to bring a product to market, but Roborock can do it in six months, Gang claimed. (Roborock’s newest innovation is a vacuum with a robotic arm that can pick up your socks.) More broadly, China sees robotics and AI as an opportunity to make its manufacturing more efficient, such as by allowing “dark factories” to operate through the night or using “factory brains” to reduce the time needed to make a product. “You’ve got to be respectful of the fact that [the Chinese] are really innovating,” Wendy Tan White, CEO of U.S. robotics firm Intrinsic, told me last week. (White spoke at the Fortune Innovation Forum in Kuala Lumpur before flying to Taiwan to announce Intrinsic’s new JV with Foxconn.) She credited China’s experience and knowledge in robotics supply chains. “I wouldn’t ignore it. In fact, eventually we could learn from it,” she said. One leading Chinese robotics startup—Agibot—will be joining us onstage at next week’s Brainstorm Design conference in Macau on Dec. 2. And, yes, one of its robots will be there too.

"Home sales and prices edged up in October but still down year over year: CREA The fact that Canada has a chronic shortage of housing relative to its population continues to drive demand Home sales and prices were down year-over-year in October but edged up from September as Canada’s housing market continues to gradually recover from trade war-induced shocks in early 2025, the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) said Monday. In its latest housing market report, CREA said 42,068 homes changed hands across the country in October, up 0.9 per cent from the previous month but down 4.3 per cent compared to last year. Shaun Cathcart, senior economist at CREA, said sales activity is “moving in the right direction,” albeit slowly due to persistent tariff-related economic uncertainty. “The market really burst to life last October in this very narrow window of time between when rates had come down but we weren’t in a trade war yet. So, we’re down a little bit from that,” he said. “But in general, compared to earlier this year, things have been trending up steadily.” The non-seasonally adjusted national average sale price was up 0.2 per cent from September but down 1.1 per cent year-over-year at $690,195. The non-seasonally adjusted National Composite MLS Home Price Index was down three per cent in October compared to last year, which CREA noted was the smallest year-over-year decline since March. Cathcart said home prices are down from a year ago due to weakness in the first quarter of 2025, when “the initial tariff shock scared everyone back to the sidelines and pulled the rug out from under the spring market.” However, he said prices are no longer falling. “I think that once we get through the winter and into the beginning of next year, you’re going to see those year-over-year declines shrink,” said Cathcart. “We might even move back into positive territory, because I don’t see prices falling further at this point, as buyers come back into the market.” Properties listed for sale across all Canadian MLS systems were up 7.2 per cent year-over-year with 189,000 listings in October, which CREA said is “very close” to the long-term average for this time of year. - Canadian home sales slowed in September, first decline since March - Canada's home sales rise nearly 2% for best August in four years: CREA - Advertisement 1Story continues below CREA reported 79,225 new listings hit the market last month, down 1.4 per cent from September. The association said fewer listings and increased sales activity “tightened” October’s sales-to-new listings ratio to 52.2 per cent, compared to 51 per cent from the month before. The ratio is below the long-term average of 54.9 per cent, with “readings roughly between 45 per cent and 65 per cent generally consistent with balanced housing market conditions,” CREA said in a release. CREA said inventory was “basically unchanged” from July, August and September at 4.4 months of inventory on a national basis at the end of October — the lowest level since January and below the long-term average of five months. Anything below 3.6 months of inventory is considered a seller’s market, while 6.4 months or more is considered a buyer’s market. Despite concerns over wider economic uncertainty and job security tempering the real estate market, the fact that Canada has a chronic shortage of housing relative to its population continues to drive demand, said Don Kottick, president of real estate brokerage REMAX Canada. “There’s a large segment of the population that is going to need to move based on life reasons, whether it’s divorce, whether they need to downsize, or whether they need to expand because their families are growing,” he said. “So, that pent-up demand is not going away, and it’s just a matter of when it is going to break.” Kottick said affordability continues to be a top concern for homebuyers, and the combination of prices coming down in many regions and lower interest rates may encourage activity in 2026. Since January, Bank of Canada has issues four cuts to its benchmark interest rate, which currently sits at 2.25 per cent. Cathcart said many Canadians may have been hesitant to lock into a five-year fixed rate — the most popular mortgage term — when they thought interest rates were still falling, but could change their minds after the central bank signalled in its last decision on Oct. 29 that it may be done with easing. “I think that could really draw a lot of those buyers off the sidelines,” he said. “But the only question is whether that happens over the winter, which is typically slower, or whether we have to wait for next spring.” • Email: jswitzer@postmedia.com Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"New economic analysis by Goldman Sachs reveals a bifurcated picture of artificial intelligence’s impact on the workforce, finding that while the technology’s role in current layoffs remains modest and unproven across the broader economy, companies focusing on AI in their workforce discussions have sharply curtailed their job openings this year. The findings, drawn from an analysis of Q3 corporate earnings commentary and results by senior economist Ronnie Walker, were drawn from management commentary and results across nearly all the S&P 500. It showed that a relationship between overall labor market outcomes and AI exposure at the economy-wide level has yet to be established. But it also showed something else. “While we still do not find a relationship between labor market outcomes and AI exposure at the economy-wide level,” Walker wrote, “we find that companies that have discussed AI in the context of their workforce have cut their job openings more sharply this year.” Indeed, Walker wrote that most components of Goldman’s layoff tracker “increased notably” in recent months. While a minority of the layoffs discussed during third-quarter earnings were attributed to AI, the AI-related share increased notably through 2025, growing to just above 15% in the quarter. But more broadly, he highlighted that the companies discussing AI in the context of their workforce or layoffs “indeed appear to be pulling back disproportionately on hiring.” Walker highlighted the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022 as a recent marker of the rapid growth in AI focus, indicating that management teams are increasingly viewing AI not just as a tool for efficiency but as a core component of their future human capital strategy, leading to preemptive cuts in new roles. Softer labor market backdrop These AI-related hiring cuts occur amid a broader easing in the U.S. labor market. Company commentary confirmed that job growth remains tepid, and the labor market is softer than it was immediately prior to the pandemic. This increased “slack” has led to reduced concerns about compensation. Mentions of wages and labor costs in earnings calls have fallen to the “lower end of the pre-pandemic range,” reinforcing the message that executives are not worried about wages growing out of control anymore. In other words, although Walker didn’t use these terms, the “Great Resignation,” when workers had significant leverage over employers, is retreating rapidly into the rearview mirror. This new era of fewer roles being advertised and a reluctance to hire has been termed, among other things, the “job-hugging” phase of the 2020s. Walker’s piece agrees with a previous analysis by his Goldman colleagues David Mericle and Pierfrancesco Mei, who argued in October that “jobless growth” may become a new normal feature of the post-pandemic economy. Further illustrating the cautious economic environment, companies facing persistent cost pressures, such as those with high tariff exposure, also sharply reduced their job openings this year. Walker found that the companies that most frequently discussed tariffs had “disproportionately cut job openings this year.” Some companies noted that they planned to mitigate costs by “hiring less, reducing headcount, or pursuing productivity-enhancing initiatives (such as investing in AI solutions).” Q3 corporate context Overall, Walker’s analysis found that corporate America is doing better than America itself, in terms of results. The largest companies demonstrated continued revenue strength, with real revenues (excluding energy) rising 4.1% year over year. This growth contrasts with the more “potential-like” 2.2% year-over-year growth in real GDP, a gap attributed partly to the greater international sales exposure of S&P 500 firms and the large weight of rapidly growing information technology companies. Elsewhere, Walker found a “bifurcated” outlook, as his research agreed with many economists’ arguments that the U.S. has a “K-shaped economy,” where consumer spending is strong overall, but concerns about lower-income health abound. Walker agreed, writing that his team found that “the healthy aggregate trends mask divergences between companies that face lower- and higher-income consumers.” Sentiment around the consumer turned negative on earnings calls for retailers whose stores are generally located in lower-income zip codes, Walker found, with their same-store sales only growing 0.2% on average, as opposed to 2.5% for companies exposed to middle- and higher-income zip codes. This underperformance is expected to continue for the low-end consumer into 2026, Walker wrote, reflecting tepid job growth and pressure from benefit cuts. Walker’s analysis agrees with anecdotal commentary from companies such as Delta and American Express, which rely on upper-middle-class consumers driving ever stronger results. And Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller told CNBC in early October that he was seeing the same bifurcation. Waller told CNBC’s Steve Liesman that high-income shoppers are “price-insensitive” and easily absorb tariff-related price hikes, with CEOs relating to him a roughly 40% pass-through at the upper end of the market. Waller called it a “two-tier” effect, with the lower half of the income distribution increasingly squeezed. If they see price hikes from tariffs, he added, CEOs are telling him they will just “walk out the door.”",right
"Artificial Christmas tree sellers in the U.S. were thrown into turmoil earlier this year when the Trump administration announced punishing tariffs on Chinese imports, including threats of 145% duties. About 85% of the 20 million or so Christmas trees being sold in the U.S. annually are artificial, and of those, about 90% are made in China. So any such tariffs threatened to send Christmas tree prices much higher in a year in which American consumers have shown themselves to be cautious and frugal. Initially, some distributors temporarily halted production in China, while others scrambled to move production to other countries as they waited to see whether the threatened tariff rates would fall. (They have, back down to a more manageable 20%.) The upshot, after those months of uncertainty, has been upward pressure of about 10% to 15% on what Americans are shelling out this year for their Christmas trees, according to leaders in the industry. “We have raised prices and I think most companies have raised prices,” National Tree Company CEO Chris Butler told Fortune. At the same time, Butler said, expectations that customers are going to be more scarce this year may create opportunities for some deals. The average owner of an artificial tree gets a new one every five years, and higher prices could convince some to hold out for one more year. Some 80% of trees are sold after Nov. 1. And the bulk of artificial trees are in the $100 to $300 range, so those tariffs are translating into real dollars in what is already a stressful holiday season for those dealing with job losses or market volatility. “We’re seeing a bit of softness early in the season for Christmas trees, and we may have to give back some of those price increases and promotions to get back to where we need to be,” says Butler, whose company sells about a million trees a year and is part of a group of 10 larger distributors that act as a de facto trade organization for artificial trees. Even before the Trump tariffs, Butler said, National Tree had already been working to diversify its supplier base to reduce dependence on China, turning to factories in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand. Butler says that roughly 50% of his production is now outside China, giving him some flexibility. And large sellers like Walmart and Home Depot have already placed some orders for 2026. Butler said that his Christmas tree group has been trying to explain to lawmakers that the tariff uncertainty could cause chaos in the 2025 Christmas season and also next year’s—meeting with the U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, with faith-based organizations at the White House, and with five senators. “We’re trying to work with the administration to make Christmas affordable,” says Butler. As for the natural Christmas tree market, so far it appears to be largely unaffected by the trade wars. It consists primarily of American trees, with the bulk of imports coming from Canada. Trees from Canada are exempt from tariffs under an agreement that covers the majority of trade between the two countries. Tree farmers say business is brisk as usual, says Rick Dungey, executive director of the National Christmas Tree Association, which represents natural tree sellers in the U.S. Even in tough or uncertain economic times, few people are going to sacrifice the tradition of getting a tree, he said. “It’s about memories,” said Dungey. “It’s about feelings. And it’s once a year, right?”",right
"President Donald Trump asked the Justice Department to start an investigation into the meatpacking industry, accusing them of “driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.” “I am asking the DOJ to act expeditiously,” Trump posted Friday on social media. “Action must be taken immediately to protect Consumers, combat Illegal Monopolies, and ensure these Corporations are not criminally profiting at the expense of the American People.” Shares for the world’s largest meatpacker, JBS NV, fell by as much as 6.2% on Trump’s comments, while Tyson Foods Inc. shares dropped by as much as 2% before paring losses to turn higher. High cost of living dominated voter concerns this week in off-year elections, propelling Democrats to victory over Trump’s Republicans in races across the country. Polls showed voters gave Trump low ratings for his handling of the economy, and afterward his advisers vowed to place a greater focus on affordability. Beef has been Trump’s latest target for tamping down food inflation, as retail ground beef prices have surged to records. The US cattle herd has shrunk precipitously as ranchers have faced high interest rates and expensive feed and droughts. Rebuilding the herd will be a years-long process. Still, Trump sought to place the blame on large corporation that process beef for consumers. “While Cattle Prices have dropped substantially, the price of Boxed Beef has gone up — Therefore, you know that something is ‘fishy.’ We will get to the bottom of it very quickly. If there is criminality, those people responsible will pay a steep price!” Trump wrote in a subsequent post.

"Millions of Americans might soon get a special one-time rebate worth up to $2,000, according to growing speculation. Hopes went up after Donald Trump said some form of relief would be paid to “everyone.” So far, no legislation has been introduced in Congress and Trump hasn’t signed any executive order for the checks. In October, Trump had suggested giving out a dividend between $1,000 and $2,000, saying the money could also help reduce the national debt. Elon Musk, who was part of the Department of Government Efficiency, earlier promoted a “DOGE dividend” idea that would give $5,000 rebates to Americans. In July, Senator Josh Hawley proposed a $600 relief check, but it didn’t pass. He said Americans deserved a share of tariff-generated money. Hawley said, “Americans deserve a tax rebate after four years of Biden policies that have devastated families’ savings and livelihoods”, as per the report by The Sun. He added, “Like President Trump proposed, my legislation would allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump’s tariffs are returning to this country.” The rebate is expected to go mainly to low and middle-income Americans earning under $100,000, as per early discussions. Q2. How will the $2,000 rebate be funded? Donald Trump said the rebate would be funded using money the government collected from tariffs. Who could get the $2,000 rebate check Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, gave more details about the possible plan on Fox and Friends. He said the proposed checks could go to people who earn less than $100,000. Bessent added that no fixed limit has been decided and said, “It’s in discussion”, as per the report by The Sun report. He also mentioned that 2026 could be a “blockbuster” year for Americans.Tariff money may fund Trump’s new relief plan On Truth Social, Trump implied that high earners would be excluded from the relief. Later, he said low and middle-income earners would receive the rebates first. Trump said the payments would be funded using government money from tariffs. Tariffs were a key policy during his last election campaign.

"President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order removing tariffs on Brazilian coffee, beef, and other agricultural products entering the U.S. The executive order removes the 40 percent tariff imposed on a series of Brazilian goods. The tariffs were originally imposed in late July through an executive order declaring Brazil as a “national security threat” to the United States. At the time, Trump cited the numerous persecution actions against former President Jair Bolsonaro and other Brazilian conservative voices, as well as the censorship of U.S. companies ordered by top court Justice Alexandre de Moraes as reasons for the tariff. De Moraes, who is essentially the most powerful judge in Brazil, was targeted with human rights sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act in response to his extensive list of persecution and censorship actions. Trump explained in Thursday’s executive order he held a phone conversation with radical leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on October 6, during which both heads of state agreed to begin talks pertaining to address the concerns detailed by Trump’s July executive order on Brazil. “These negotiations are ongoing,” Trump said, and added that he has received additional information and recommendations from various officials monitoring the circumstances of the July order. After considering the information, Trump further explained that it is necessary to modify the scope of the items subjected to tariffs. The new modification affects Brazilian imports entering the U.S. on or after November 13 — the date when Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira in Washington. “In my judgment, these modifications are necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14323,” Trump stressed. Trump attached an updated version of the original July executive order’s annex, detailing the Brazilian imports subjected to the new tariff modifications. Brazilian President Lula celebrated Trump’s executive order through a video posted on his social media accounts on Thursday night next to his Vice President and Finance Minister. Lula described Trump’s decision as “a step in the right direction,” but asserted “we need to go even further.” “The removal of the 40 percent tariff imposed by the US government on various Brazilian agricultural products is a victory for dialogue, diplomacy, and common sense,” Lula’s message read. “The frank dialogue I had with President Trump and the work of our negotiating teams, formed by Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and Ministers Fernando Haddad and Mauro Vieira on the Brazilian side, enabled important advances.” “This was a step in the right direction, but we need to go even further,” he continued. “We will continue this dialogue with President Trump, guided by our sovereignty and the interests of Brazilian workers, agriculture, and industry.” COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Brazilian coffee exporters celebrated Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the removal of additional import tariffs on the product that had been set at 40% in July. Cecafé, Brazil’s coffee exporters council, called the tariff hike “a complete loss of competitiveness.” “The tariff reversal comes after months of intense work representing the interests of Brazilian coffee. It is a historic victory for the entire coffee agribusiness production chain,” the council said in a statement. Brazil has long been a key supplier of beef and coffee to the United States. On Thursday, Trump lifted tariffs on Brazilian goods as part of an effort to lower consumer costs for Americans. The decision affected coffee, fruit and beef, among other products. The U.S. leader had imposed additional import taxes on Brazilian goods, citing trade practices he deemed unfair and the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who was later sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting to stage a coup after losing the 2022 election. Before the tariffs, U.S. government data showed Brazil, the world’s top coffee producer, supplied about 30% of the American market, followed by Colombia at roughly 20% and Vietnam at about 10%. “The removal of the 40% tariff imposed by the U.S. government on several Brazilian agricultural products is a victory for dialogue, diplomacy and common sense,” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Thursday on X. He also shared a video reacting to Trump’s order, saying he was pleased with the decision. Trump and Lula have been negotiating over trade, which could further reduce tariffs. Lula also praised “the frank dialogue” with Trump, and said that Brazil would continue talks. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",right
"Democratic lawmakers deflected questions on why the stock market has had success under President Donald Trump in spite of their dark predictions on the administration’s tariffs while speaking with Fox News Digital on Capitol Hill. Some downplayed the market’s success, indicating that it has no bearing on the country’s true economic pulse. Asked by Fox News Digital why the stock market is still doing well if Trump’s tariffs are hurting the economy, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., shot back, ""The stock market is not the economy."" She insisted that because of the tariffs, Americans ""are feeling price crunch when they go to the grocery store, prices are high."" ""The tariffs are a cause of that.

Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., told Fox News Digital that she believes the stock market is only doing well ""because the billionaires are continuing to do well."" ""Corporations got massive tax breaks, $7 billion in tax breaks in the big, bad betrayal bill,"" said Jayapal. ""That's why the stock market's doing well, because the stock is really, you know, a lot of those large companies feel like they're doing just fine, they're continuing to get huge tax breaks."" Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., said that ""no matter what the stock market is saying, [Americans] are seeing the cost of groceries have not gone down. They are seeing that health care costs have become really exorbitant. They can't afford it. They can’t afford the cost of goods."" ""That is what they expect us to respond to, is how it is affecting them and their everyday lives. And that's what I am here and focused on doing,"" she went on. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Fox News Digital that ""everybody in America knows that the price of goods subject to the tariffs are higher."" ""The stock market matters to a lot of folks, but prices matter the most to people. And right now, people are hurting because of Trump's economic policies, including the tariffs,"" he said. ""This is not what Democrats are saying. It's just a fact that tariffs are costing consumers thousands of dollars."" The Trump administration, meanwhile, has blamed the Biden administration for the persistent high prices at grocery stores rather than the tariffs. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X, urging Americans to ""TRUST IN TRUMP"" and saying that the president’s ""pro-growth policies are a proven formula to Make America Affordable Again. They worked in his first term, and they are slowly but surely working now."" ""President Trump and his entire Administration, from the NEC to Treasury to USDA, are working hard every day to address the affordability issues created by Joe Biden, who unleashed the worst inflation crisis in modern American history — something the liberal media barely blamed the Democrats for over the past 4 years."" Leavitt wrote that ""the price of eggs, butter, ice cream, fresh fruit, cereal, fish, seafood, rice, pasta, and ham are all falling,"" adding that ""the best is yet to come."" Back on Capitol Hill, Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., echoed this sentiment, saying, ""The point that [Democrats] are missing is that [Trump] is trying to get us better terms from all the countries that we export to, trying to get a level playing field, trying to grow our exports."" ""You have to separate the short term from what's going to happen over time,"" he explained. ""They're trying to make the argument in the short term because of some of the challenges of getting other countries to play fair."" ""You have to work through this process,"" Hoeven went on. ""The president did it in his first term, and we ended up with huge sales to China and other places, and that helped our ag markets and our other exports. And so, it's the same thing again; he is working to make sure we get better trade terms for all of our manufacturers, processors, farmers, and everyone else. But it doesn't happen in one day, it doesn't happen overnight."" SENATE REPUBLICANS DEFECT, REJECT TRUMP'S TARIFFS ON CANADIAN GOODS Trump’s tariffs are not all universally reviled by Democrats. Sen.

"UPS beat Wall Street’s profit expectations last quarter, driven not by stronger demand but by deep cost cuts. The company eliminated 34,000 jobs and closed 93 facilities—a 70 percent increase from earlier projections—reflecting a broad restructuring aimed at stabilizing margins after a period of sluggish growth and rising expenses. Chief commercial officer Matt Guffey describes the effort as a structural transformation rather than a short-term fix. It includes a reorientation of UPS’s business model, shifting away from low-margin e-commerce deliveries toward industrial, healthcare, and supply-chain clients that offer steadier, higher-value contracts. Artificial intelligence and data automation now play a central role in daily operations, Guffey says. In UPS call centers, machine-learning systems route inquiries based on customer needs and expected resolution times, reducing wait times and increasing the number of issues resolved during the first call. The same technology is used to optimize delivery routes, manage capacity, and forecast demand. Automation, however, has brought workforce challenges. Thousands of positions have been eliminated as UPS consolidates operations and automates tasks once handled by people. Guffey says the company is working to manage the transition responsibly through early communication and retraining. “It’s not just being overly communicative, but timing of communication is important,” he notes. “We want to inform people so we can help them upskill in different areas.” UPS has said it plans to redeploy some workers into roles focused on data analytics, network efficiency, and customer experience—positions that reflect the company’s evolving operational priorities. As chief commercial officer, Guffey is responsible for accelerating UPS’s profitability and growth. He acknowledges that innovation is a cultural challenge inside a large organization approaching its 120th anniversary. UPS’s approach to modernization often reveals the tension between transformation and legacy. The company has long dominated the market for product returns, but consumer expectations have shifted dramatically. Shoppers now demand faster, easier, and more sustainable return options: no boxes, no labels, and minimal friction. They expect seamless digital integration, real-time updates, flexible drop-off points, and reduced packaging waste. UPS met that shift head-on by acquiring Happy Returns, says Guffey, a startup offering “no box, no label” drop-offs at thousands of partner locations. The acquisition gave UPS a more flexible, customer-friendly platform that aligns with modern expectations of convenience and sustainability. It also signaled a willingness to buy innovation when speed matters most, rather than rely solely on in-house development. While Guffey acknowledges that speed has become a competitive factor, he notes that UPS still operates within the realities of a large, complex organization built on reliability. The company’s cost-cutting drive comes amid a wave of consolidation across the logistics industry. Rival carriers are facing similar pressures, including softer demand, rising labor costs, and the ripple effects of shifting trade policies and tariff uncertainty.. For UPS, the challenge will be sustaining profitability once the immediate benefits of job reductions and facility closures fade. The restructuring leaves UPS leaner and more sharply focused, says Guffey. He adds that as it rebuilds margins through automation and selective growth, the company must balance efficiency with the service consistency that has defined its reputation for more than a century.",right
"US Trade Deficit Narrowed in August After Tariffs Set In The US trade deficit shrank in August as a slew of global tariff rates from President Donald Trump kicked in, official data showed Wednesday after a lengthy delay due to a government shutdown. (Bloomberg) — The US trade deficit shrank in August as a slew of global tariff rates from President Donald Trump kicked in, official data showed Wednesday after a lengthy delay due to a government shutdown. The goods and services trade gap narrowed almost 24% from the prior month to $59.6 billion, the Commerce Department said. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a $60.4 billion deficit. The trade report had been scheduled for release on Oct. 7 but was delayed by the longest federal government shutdown, which ended last week. The agency said an updated release date for the September trade data, initially slated for Nov. 4, has yet to be determined. In August, the value of US imports decreased 5.1%, the most in four months, while exports edged up. The figures aren’t adjusted for inflation. A month earlier, the trade deficit widened as companies raced to import goods and materials ahead of so-called reciprocal tariffs that were initially announced in April. Those duties were paused for several months as some countries raced to strike deals with the US, many of which eventually took effect in August. The large monthly swings in trade this year have introduced similar volatility in the government’s measure of economic activity — gross domestic product. Prior to the August data, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow forecast saw net exports contributing 0.57 percentage point to third-quarter GDP. Separately, the Census Bureau announced Wednesday that it will issue the September retail sales report on Nov. 25, and durable goods orders data for the same month on Nov. 26. Gold Imports The slump in imports was led by a sharp drop in inbound shipments of nonmonetary gold, the agency said. The pullback reflected a massive increase in tariffs on Switzerland, a large exporter of gold. The US deficit with Switzerland narrowed substantially in August. The two countries have since struck a deal to lower import duties. US imports of capital goods including computer accessories and communications equipment also fell in August. On an inflation-adjusted basis, the merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $83.7 billion in August, the smallest since the end of 2023. The August report showed the merchandise-trade shortfall with China widened to the largest since April, while the deficit with Mexico narrowed slightly. The shortfall with Canada shrank. —With assistance from Chris Middleton. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion. Please keep comments relevant and respectful.

"President Donald Trump is increasingly counting on the tech sector and the development of artificial intelligence to deliver on his economic agenda, a reality laid bare this week as he hosted Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The crown prince has committed to invest $1 trillion with U.S. companies, a pledge that is largely about using Saudi Arabia’s oil and natural gas reserves to pivot his nation into becoming an AI data hub. “We will work closely with friends and partners like those in this room to build the largest, most powerful, most innovative AI ecosystem in the world,” Trump said at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum on Wednesday. Sitting in the front row of the audience at the Kennedy Center were Nvidia co-founder Jensen Huang and tech billionaire Elon Musk. Trump took credit for the new investments and stock market performance this year — both of which have been a function of the AI buildout. For all of Trump’s claims that his tariffs are generating new investments, much of that foreign capital is going to data centers for AI’s computing demands or the power facilities needed to run those data centers. The president called the stock market gains “amazing,” yet leading stock indices fell Tuesday over growing anxiety about whether AI companies are fueling a broader financial bubble. There are also growing political risks for Trump if the AI buildout further pushes up utility prices for American consumers or if the jobs he promises in the sector fail to materialize. The consultancy Oxford Economics released an analysis Tuesday that said AI investments offset the “extreme uncertainty” in the U.S. economy this year — uncertainty caused in part by Trump’s tariff hikes that have elevated inflation and potentially contributed to a slowdown in hiring. The firm noted that AI companies are starting to rely on debt to pay for the growth in the sector, which could suggest “a more vulnerable phase” next year for the boom. Saudi investments are anchored in AI growth The race for investments is evidenced in Saudi Arabia’s own commitments, which rose from $600 billion during Trump’s visit there in May to $1 trillion when Prince Mohammed came to the White House on Tuesday. Trump said he’s already pushed Prince Mohammed to increase that figure, saying he lobbied the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia backstage before their appearance at the Kennedy Center. “While we were taking the picture, I said, ’Could you make it $1.5 trillion?’” Trump said. “So he’s got something to think about.” When Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman was asked at the forum what the most important growth stories were at the summit, the billionaire investor said, “AI and, you know, power.” “Those are the two things that we spend a lot of time on,” he said. “At Blackstone, my company, we’re the largest developer, the largest owner, of data centers in the world. And this is a really explosive area.” Tareq Amin, CEO of Humain, said his Saudi-backed AI company was launched when Trump visited the Middle Eastern nation in May. His company saw the opportunity to build data centers and AI infrastructure by leveraging Saudi Arabia’s energy production and U.S. technology. “Yes, it is an ambitious, crazy thing,” Amin said with confidence. Musk, whose xAI company has a chatbot called Grok, predicted that AI and robots would eventually allow work to become optional for human beings, that money would become “irrelevant” and poverty would cease to exist. “AI and humanoid robots will actually eliminate poverty,” said Musk, the head of Tesla and SpaceX. He added that robots would “make everyone wealthy.” Nvidia’s Huang, appearing on stage with Musk, did not make as bold a prediction. He said: “Everybody’s jobs will be different. I think that that’s for sure.” Huang spoke ahead of the $4.5 trillion computer chip company announcing its quarterly earnings Wednesday. The company afterward reported strong earnings for its third quarter with net income climbing 65% from a year ago. During Trump’s remarks, the president asked Huang if any other country could compete with its Blackwell chip that is enabling much of the AI development. “Not yet, sir,” said Huang from the front row.",right

"Terminal Tariffs: Modeling the Final Destination of Trump's Trade War President Donald Trump’s return to the White House has thrown the global trade system into disarray. Leaders have rushed to secure deals with Washington. Average US tariffs have leaped from 2% last year to close to 16%, a level last seen in the 1930s. The new regime will create many losers, few winners. (Bloomberg) — President Donald Trump’s return to the White House has thrown the global trade system into disarray. Leaders have rushed to secure deals with Washington. Average US tariffs have leaped from 2% last year to close to 16%, a level last seen in the 1930s. The new regime will create many losers, few winners. Further seismic shifts are possible. We consider three scenarios: a détente with China, an all-against-China alliance and the emergence of “Fortress North America.” For each we assess how small open economies—the orphaned children of the rules-based trade order—can navigate a path through the great-power rivalries that threaten their prosperity. • The most extreme outcome arrives if the world unites against China’s exporting of overcapacity. Our models point to a 4% hit to the country’s gross domestic product by 2030. Across the scenarios, losses for the US are limited to less than 1% of GDP, reflecting the resilience of an economy that remains the biggest in the world and among the least dependent on trade. • For small open economies such as those of Singapore, South Korea and Switzerland, taking the high road—avoiding retaliatory tariffs or joining tariff coalitions—delivers the least-bad outcomes. If the US and China break off relations and small open economies can fill in the missing links in the supply chain, they may even be marginally better off than in a free-trade world. The pendulum in the US has swung from free trade to protectionism. For some products, the hike in tariffs is vertiginous: an extra 50% on Indian clothes and Brazilian coffee and 60% on Chinese aluminum. Indeed, it’s Brazil, China and India that stand out, slammed with additional duties layered on top of sectoral and reciprocal tariffs. Some countries have done better. Mexico and Canada remain largely shielded under USMCA carve-outs. The European Union and Japan, despite running big trade surpluses with the US, struck deals almost as good as the one secured by the UK, which runs no surplus and has stronger diplomatic ties to the US. Several small open Asian economies—including Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam—have struck trade agreements with the US but still face steep reciprocal tariffs of about 19%-20%. South Korea secured a more favorable deal but at the cost of major investment pledges. Switzerland faces one of the highest rates among US partners, at 39%. This patchwork of tariffs in place as of Oct. 20 means that US importers would face a duty of 16% if they were to purchase the same goods from the same partners as they did in 2024, up from just above 2%. This has wide implications. Using a model of global trade deployed by the World Trade Organization, we expect US imports to fall 18% by 2030, with a near-70% plunge in imports from China. Canada and Mexico, sheltered from higher tariffs, are well-placed to weather the storm. Over time, economies will adjust. Exporters will find other markets and rely more on domestic consumers. Even while facing a large drop in US exports, China’s GDP is down only 0.3% by 2030. By pulling away from global trade, the US could be the biggest loser, with a GDP hit of 0.7% by 2030. Any gains in domestic manufacturing are likely to be outweighed by losses in services and higher input costs, leaving the economy worse off overall. Where To From Here With the tariff dice still rolling, the game isn’t over yet. The US continues to engage with Beijing the future of their trade relationship.The EU is figuring out its response to Chinese overcapacity. USMCA renegotiation looms. The legal basis for the current tariffsis in question, investigations into sectoral tariffs continue, and Trump relishes tariffs as an all-purpose foreign policy instrument. To assess the risks, we set out three scenarios: • Détente with China: The US drops the 20% fentanyl-related tariff on China but maintains sectoral tariffs and a 10% reciprocal rate. All other tariffs are unchanged.• China alone: As overcapacity from Beijing’s industrial policy spills out, the rest of the world imposes tariffs. China retaliates. • Fortress North America: The US, Mexico and Canada for a closer bloc, dropping tariffs on one another but raising them against all others. Everyone else retaliates. The economic implications vary sharply. In the détente scenario, lowering tariffs on China reduces the hit to US GDP to 0.5%. China is substantially better off, losing only around 10% of its exports to the US. Should the world unite against China’s overcapacity, the US again limits its GDP drag to 0.5%. But China takes a far bigger hit, losing as much as 4% of GDP by 2030. In the Fortress North America scenario, despite avoiding US tariffs, Canada and Mexico emerge as the biggest losers, with GDP down about 1% by 2030. China also suffers as its tariff-free back door into the US through Canada and Mexico shuts.How Smaller Players Navigate the Chaos For small open economies—those deeply tied into global supply chains, yet lacking leverage against larger players—the trade war is achallenge. We model how economies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, plus Taiwan, South Korea, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and the UK fare under the scenarios detailed above. In the status quo, many small open economies haven’t secured deals as good as the EU’s and Japan’s. Even so, the absence of US tariffs on semiconductors, electronics and pharmaceuticals benefits them disproportionately. Losses are noticeable but not disastrous. If the US backs off China, the removal of the fentanyl tariff could deepen losses for small open economies. That’s because many are otherwise well placed to capture US market share lost by China, especially in electronics. Should the world turn against China, joining the coalition risks losses close to 1% of GDP for Asian economies that are closely linked to Beijing. Refusing to join and avoiding Chinese retaliation could yield better outcomes, including modest GDP gains, if countries position themselves as intermediaries between China and the rest of the world. But that strategy carries the risk of US retaliation. In a Fortress North America situation, similar to the status-quo tariffs, small open economies can mitigate the losses by not retaliating and remaining open among themselves. In each case the small open economies do better if they reduce frictions among themselves and refuse to join the race-to- the-bottom in the global trade war. For the orphaned children of globalization, thriving in the new global order will require agility, diplomatic smarts and luck.

"As Americans gear up for another bustling holiday season, shoppers may find their budgets stretched further than expected—not by retailers’ markups, but by tariffs. According to a new LendingTree analysis, current tariffs amount to what is essentially a $29 billion tax on the 2025 holiday shopping season, hitting families and individuals right as they fill their carts with gifts for loved ones. LendingTree’s study reveals that at current rates, tariffs would have raised the overall cost of 2024 winter holiday gift shopping by $40.6 billion. Crucially, $28.6 billion—over 70% of this increase—would have been passed directly onto consumers. That translates into an estimated $132 in extra costs for the every holiday shopper in the United States. Matt Schulz, LendingTree’s chief consumer finance analyst, emphasized that anything increasing the cost of holiday shopping creates “real challenges for consumers.” For most Americans, he added, “spending an extra $132 at the holidays is significant.” Maybe it isn’t “earth-shattering for some,” he said, but he predicted it may prompt people to cut back on gift-giving this year or even take on extra debt, calling it “a choice no one wants to have to make.” Electronics and clothing carry the heaviest burden The report shows not all gifts are impacted equally. Electronics and clothing or accessories are particularly hard-hit, accounting for more than 60% of the additional consumer costs. The average extra tariff cost per shopper was estimated at $186 for electronics, and $82 for clothing or accessories. With 88% of all clothing and 69% of electronics being imported, the holiday shopping lists of many Americans are tightly linked to global supply chains—and thus, to tariff policies. In total, consumers spent an estimated $377.7 billion on imported goods for gifts during the 2024 winter holiday shopping season. Retailers are not immune to the pressure, either, as the analysis calculated they would have absorbed about 29.5% of the total tariff burden in 2024, some $12 billion. While retailers share in the pain, experts say much of the cost ultimately makes its way to consumers, particularly as companies pass on expenses to remain profitable. LendingTree disclosed its estimates were based on data from Adobe, the National Retail Federation (NRF), the Department of Commerce, the Census Bureau, The Budget Lab at Yale and its own data. The researchers then applied an estimated 17.8% effective tariff rate and assumed a 70.5% pass-through rate from retailers to consumers, based on the midpoint of the range from the Budget Lab’s study. Researchers also adjusted the 2024 U.S. adult population for the 81% who reported buying holiday gifts to LendingTree and, to calculate the burden per shopper, applied the NRF’s category-level shopping percentages and divided each category’s consumer tariff burden by its number of shoppers. Despite the significant costs outlined by LendingTree, Americans are unlikely to abandon electronics and clothing as go-to holiday gifts. Schulz acknowledged that, though prices are climbing, demand for these categories remains strong, and families may simply be forced to “suck up the higher costs or give fewer of those items as gifts.”",right
"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is trolling after New York City’s election of Muslim socialist Zohran Mamdani, asking in an X poll whether the Sunshine State should impose tariffs on fleeing New Yorkers or build a wall. DeSantis posted a poll on X after major networks called the race for Mamdani, asking Floridians what the response to Mamdani’s election should be. He provided three options: Building a border wall in Florida, tariffing new transplants, or recruiting new transplants. At the time of this writing, with 31,735 votes cast and 12 hours left to vote in the informal survey, 48.8 percent said Florida should build a wall, followed by 37 percent who said tariff all new transplants and 14.2 percent who said recruit new transplants. DeSantis also responded to a post from Florida State Representative Peggy Gossett-Seidman (R), who said Tuesday night, “Florida should tariff everyone fleeing NYC, Gov @RonDeSantis!” The governor responded with a question: “Have you filed that bill?” Prior to election night, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) also issued a threat. “After the polls close tomorrow night, I will impose a 100% tariff on anyone moving to Texas from NYC,” he said. DeSantis has been warning of the consequences of New York City electing Mamdani, predicting last week that the socialist would become the “most prominent Democrat in America” if he is elected mayor of New York City. “Assuming he gets elected, Mamdani will be the most prominent Democrat in America the day he takes office,” DeSantis said, responding to an X post from Elon Musk in which the Tesla CEO called Mamdani the “future of the Democrat Party.” “Voters across the country will be able to watch his leftist agenda in action and know that his path is the Democrat path nationally. Will be good for Republicans, bad for New York City,” the governor added. DeSantis on Wednesday also posted a clip from Mamdani’s victory speech, featuring the mayor-elect telling New Yorkers that his administration “will prove that there is no problem too large for government to solve and no concern too small for it to care about.” “I’m from the government and I’m here to help!” DeSantis said, quoting former President Ronald Reagan who once said, “I’ve always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the Government, and I’m here to help.'” With 90.5 percent of the results in on Wednesday morning, Mamdani led former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the race with 50.4 percent of the vote to Cuomo’s 41.6 percent. COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"The Supreme Court recently heard arguments in a case that will decide whether the president overstepped his authority by invoking an old war law to justify imposing tariffs on seemingly every country and product under the sun. Though White House lawyers changed their tune in front of the justices, up till this point, one of the administration’s defenses throughout this trade war is that these tariffs are needed because they bring in substantial revenue for the country, money that could be used to help turn the tide on Social Security’s and Medicare’s fiscal outlooks. But whether the administration actually believes this tariff revenue is “incidental” to their larger goal, the truth is these tariffs will not alter the trajectory of our national debt or entitlement programs. In many cases, it may make their outlook worse. For the sake of the economy, SCOTUS should put an end to this abuse of power. In their official brief to the Court, White House officials claimed that if the courts decide that the law in question, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), can’t be used for unilaterally levying tariffs, the lost revenue would “lead to financial ruin.” A spade should be called a spade, and it’s true that if SCOTUS rules against the White House, there would be a negative fiscal impact. Tax Foundation finds that the IEEPA tariffs will raise about $1.8 trillion over the next decade if they stay in place. Though Republicans once balked at tax hikes of that size, this one in particular needs to be considered in the context of the other ills these tariffs bring. To begin, Trump’s trade war will shrink the economy by nearly 0.4 percent, per our estimates. That hit alone reduces the tariffs’ revenue potential by more than $400 billion. All in all, when you look at the revenue window for the next 10 years, even a best-case scenario leads to the IEEPA tariffs accounting for less than 2 percent of the country’s total revenue. That amount of money is not going to be the solution to Social Security’s and Medicare’s dire outlook. By 2034, due in part to the extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts through this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the amount of debt held by the public will rise from a projected baseline of 117.1 percent to 124.6 percent. It will only fall to 122.3 percent if the IEEPA tariff revenue is fully collected over that time period. These are astonishing, scary outlooks. Publicly held debt is set to rise to a higher share of GDP than ever recorded over the next few years, and the IEEPA tariffs would do little to move the needle. Absent any major changes, Medicare’s and Social Security’s trust funds are set to run dry by 2033. Social Security and Medicare are funded by payroll taxes, meaning we need an active and growing workforce to help keep their wheels turning. The IEEPA tariffs would have the opposite effect: before factoring in retaliation from other countries, we estimate that these tax hikes would lead to a loss of nearly 428,000 workers. Big problems require big solutions. And maybe it’s admirable that the president believes his trade war could improve our fiscal outlook. If the simple solution to the crisis facing Social Security and Medicare were simply more money, perhaps tariffs could be a topic worthy of debate. But in that debate, it becomes clear that the trade-offs aren’t worth the risk. This trade war is a jobs crusher. It’s a strain on our diplomatic relationships. And it’s one of the largest tax hikes in American history, costing the average household $1,300 per year. The IEEPA tariffs cannot save our entitlement programs, which may be why White House lawyers backed off their revenue argument in front of the Justices, but they will be another blow to our workforce and pocketbooks. Limitations on the president’s power to unilaterally impose significant tax hikes would be a welcome decision.

"The Supreme Court is weighing whether to expand presidential power in a case over Donald Trump’s global tariffs, but key constitutional issues could doom the president’s argument. The high court raised separation of powers concerns during recent oral arguments about the absence of Congress’ role in Trump’s sweeping trade plan, which the president has said is critical to foreign policy and national security and a matter of ""life or death"" for the country. Justices across the ideological spectrum peppered Solicitor General John Sauer, the lawyer arguing on behalf of Trump, with questions about whether the president overstepped his authority. They framed their inquiries at times around two legal principles, known as the major questions and non-delegation doctrines, and scrutinized the text of the emergency law Trump invoked to enact the tariffs. Justice Clarence Thomas set the stage for the nearly three-hour arguments. In the first question of the day, Thomas, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, asked Sauer to ""spend a few minutes on why exactly the major questions doctrine doesn't apply to the president in this case."" BARRETT AND SOTOMAYOR TAG-TEAM TRUMP LAWYER ON TARIFF POWERS Under the principle, courts look to make sure the executive branch has not used a vaguely written law to carry out an act of major national significance, like worldwide tariffs. Sauer responded that the tariffs case, which involved foreign trade deals, was a ""particularly poor fit"" to apply the major questions doctrine because courts should give broader power to the president on foreign policy matters. Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the CATO Institute, which has sided against Trump in the case, told Fox News Digital he has seen two trends emerge from the Supreme Court. One is a long-term trend where the high court is highly deferential to the president on overseas matters, but the other, he said, was a more recent use of the major questions doctrine. Courts have increasingly used the doctrine to demand clear statutory permission for blockbuster policies, striking down agency actions in West Virginia v. EPA and Biden v. Nebraska. Several justices asked whether that same rule applies when the president, rather than an agency, claims sweeping tariff power under the statute Trump used, which never mentions the word ""tariffs."" ""It's not clear which trend will play out,"" Skorup said. ""My hunch is that most, and this was confirmed at oral arguments, most justices are probably leaning towards favoring the importers and these more recent doctrinal trends will prevail."" He added he was encouraged by Chief Justice Roberts pressing Sauer about the matter. ""He seemed to think there's a major questions problem here,"" Skorup said. TRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER' Trump has been on a rampage this week, emphasizing the perceived stakes of the case, a sign that he could be bracing for an unfavorable outcome. Trump claimed that if the tariffs are deemed illegal, the potential refund process could exceed $3 trillion. He said the justices were given ""wrong numbers"" about repayment costs. ""It would not be possible to ever make up for that kind of ‘drubbing,’"" Trump wrote on social media. ""That would truly become an insurmountable National Security Event, and devastating to the future of our Country – Possibly non-sustainable!"" Trump used the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to sidestep Congress' role in approving taxes and tariffs, saying the opioid epidemic and trade deficit amounted to a national emergency and justified a host of tariffs on imports from major trading partners from China and India to Canada and Mexico. Trump has touted the billions in revenue collected by the government and said it will be used to pay $2,000 to lower-income families and pay off some of the national debt. TRUMP’S OWN SCOTUS PICKS COULD WIND UP HURTING HIM ON TARIFFS But the justices repeatedly questioned how Trump could justify bypassing Congress, especially when IEEPA was not clear on the matter. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Sonia Sotomayor, Trump and Obama appointees, respectively, grilled Sauer about how IEEPA did not spell out that the president could unilaterally enact tariffs, even if it did give the president the power to ""regulate imports."" The Supreme Court could also factor the non-delegation doctrine into its finding, either in an avoidant or direct way. The key question is, even if IEEPA could be read to allow tariffs, would that reading hand the president Congress’s core tariff authority without a limiting principle? Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, seemed particularly interested in the issue, asking Sauer if Congress could ""delegate to the president the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations as he sees fit."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If the Supreme Court were to take the avoidant route, according to Ilan Wurman, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, it could interpret IEEPA narrowly to avoid a possible finding that Congress improperly passed off its tariff authority to the president. Wurman told Fox News Digital that would be easier than directly concluding that Congress gave up its constitutional power to another branch of government. But, Wurman said, ""on the other hand, every century or so the Supreme Court should strike something down under the non-delegation doctrine. Give it a little life here and there, right?"" A decision is expected by late June.",right
"President Donald Trump's power to unilaterally impose far-reaching tariffs is coming before the Supreme Court on Wednesday in a pivotal test of executive power with trillion-dollar implications for the global economy. The Republican administration is trying to defend the tariffs central to Trump's economic agenda after lower courts ruled the emergency law he invoked doesn't give him near-limitless power to set and change duties on imports. The Constitution says Congress has the power to levy tariffs. But the Trump administration argues that in emergency situations the president can regulate importation taxes like tariffs. Trump has called the case one of the most important in the country's history and said a ruling against him would be ""catastrophic"" for the economy. The challengers argue the 1977 emergency-powers law Trump used doesn't even mention tariffs, and no president before has used it to impose them. A collection of small businesses say the uncertainty is driving them to the brink of bankruptcy. The case centers on two sets of tariffs. The first came in February on imports from Canada, China and Mexico after Trump declared a national emergency over drug trafficking. The second involves the sweeping ""reciprocal"" tariffs on most countries that Trump announced in April. Multiple lawsuits have been filed over the tariffs, and the court will hear suits filed by Democratic-leaning states and small businesses focused on everything from plumbing supplies to women's cycling apparel. Lower courts have struck down the bulk of his tariffs as an illegal use of emergency power, but the nation's highest court may see it differently. Trump helped shape the conservative-majority court, naming three of the justices in his first term. The justices have so far been reluctant to check his extraordinary flex of executive power, handing him a series of wins on its emergency docket. Still, those have been short-term orders - little of Trump's wide-ranging conservative agenda has been fully argued before the nation's highest court. That means the outcome could set the tone for wider legal pushback against his policies. The justices have been skeptical of executive power claims before, such as when then-President Joe Biden tried to forgive $400 billion in student loans under a different law dealing with national emergencies. The Supreme Court found the law didn't clearly give him the power to enact a program with such a big economic impact, a legal principle known as the major questions doctrine. The challengers say Trump's tariffs should get the same treatment, since they'll have a much greater economic effect, raising some $3 trillion over the next decade. The government, on the other hand, says the tariffs are different because they're a major part of his approach to foreign affairs, an area where the courts should not be second-guessing the president. The challengers are also trying to channel the conservative justices' skepticism about whether the Constitution allows other parts of the government to use powers reserved for Congress, a concept known as the nondelegation doctrine. Trump's interpretation of the law could mean anyone who can ""regulate"" can also impose taxes, they say. The Justice Department counters that legal principle is for governmental agencies, not for the president. If he eventually loses at the high court, Trump could impose tariffs under other laws, but those have more limitations on the speed and severity with which he could act. The aftermath of a ruling against him also could be complicated, if the government must issue refunds for the tariffs that had collected $195 billion in revenue as of September. The Trump administration did win over four appeals court judges who found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, gives the president authority to regulate importation during emergencies without explicit limitations. In recent decades, Congress has ceded some tariff authority to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.

"Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) claimed the Republican Party had become a “party for one,” suggesting everything they were doing is for President Donald Trump. Sherrill said, “When you have the Republicans that have the presidency, they have the majority in the Senate, they have the majority in the House. They’ve even, many would say- including myself, taken over the court system. Then they have a responsibility to open up this government.” She continued, “We see again and again these Republican attacks on everything from health care. Look, if if they don’t fund the Affordable Care Act, costs are going to go up by 175% for people here in New Jersey, at already high levels. That is going to kick so many people off health care that’s on top of the huge Medicare cuts that we’re seeing in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,’ on top of the tariff cuts that are raising grocery prices everywhere, on top of the fight he’s in now, which is raising gas prices. So again and again, we’re seeing the Trump administration punishing people, and these Republicans have got to come to the table, and they’ve got to start really working for the American people.” She added, “As I was talking to people across the state, thousands of people, they wanted to see an agenda to get their costs down, and something that was going to take place quickly.” Sherrill concluded, “They know that the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ is going to take away their health care. They know that attacks on the Gateway Tunnel Project are going to raise costs here and really cut into job opportunities. So they want to know that whoever is governing is going to be focused on governing for them, not a party of one like Donald Trump.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"SunOpta Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Results MINNEAPOLIS — SunOpta Inc. (“SunOpta” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: STKL) (TSX:SOY), a company that delivers customized supply chain solutions and innovation for top brands, retailers and foodservice providers across a broad portfolio of beverages, broths and better-for-you snacks today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 27, 2025. All amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars and results are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except where specifically noted. - Revenues of $205.4 million increased 16.8% compared to $175.9 million in the prior year period, driven by strong volume growth across beverages, broths, and fruit snacks - Earnings from continuing operations of $0.8 million compared to a loss of $6.2 million in the prior year period - Adjusted earnings¹ from continuing operations of $6.0 million compared to $1.8 million in the prior year period - Adjusted earnings per share¹ from continuing operations of $0.05 compared to $0.02 in the prior year period - Adjusted EBITDA¹ from continuing operations increased 13.4% to $23.6 million compared to $20.8 million in the prior year period “We delivered outstanding revenue growth in the third quarter and affirmed the strength of our competitive position, the diversity of our revenue streams and the robust demand across our portfolio,” said Brian Kocher, Chief Executive Officer of SunOpta. “During the quarter, the combination of category tailwinds and several pipeline opportunities, that were originally anticipated for 2026, accelerated our revenue growth resulting in a 17% volume increase. While the speed and magnitude of the volume growth stressed our supply chain, I’m proud of the team for exceeding our production targets to support this growth and confident in our ability to return to planned gross margin expansion activities by mid-2026.” Kocher continued, “Our new business pipeline and category demand are exceeding expectations. Customers are demanding additional capacity at a rate and speed we had not anticipated. Accordingly, we are announcing a new aseptic manufacturing line at our Midlothian, Texas facility that is already over 50% subscribed and will come online in late 2026. Along with the previously announced fruit snack line in Omak, Washington, we are positioned to meet expected market demand through the end of 2028.” Revenues increased 16.8% to $205.4 million for the third quarter of 2025 and reflected strong volume growth in beverage, broth, and fruit snack product categories. For the third quarter of 2025, unfavorable pricing impact of lower pass-through pricing for certain raw material cost savings was largely offset by incremental pass-through pricing adjustments for tariff costs. Gross profit increased $2.6 million, or 11.4%, to $25.5 million for the quarter ended September 27, 2025, compared with $22.9 million for the quarter ended September 28, 2024. Gross margin was 12.4% for the quarter ended September 27, 2025, compared with 13.0% for the quarter ended September 28, 2024, a decrease of 60 basis points. Adjusted gross margin¹ was 13.6% for the quarter ended September 27, 2025, compared with 16.6% for the quarter ended September 28, 2024. The decrease partially reflected investments in labor and infrastructure to improve long-term margins, increased maintenance expense, and higher waste and labor costs as a result of certain manufacturing pressures from tremendous volume growth, together with temporary volume limitations and increased downtime resulting from the excess wastewater issue at our Midlothian, Texas, facility. All of these factors were partially offset by higher sales and production volumes for beverages, broths and fruit snacks driving improved plant utilization. Operating income increased $6.1 million to $6.9 million for the quarter ended September 27, 2025, compared with $0.8 million for the quarter ended September 28, 2024. The increase in operating income mainly reflected lower employee variable compensation costs based on performance, lower professional fees related to operational productivity initiatives, and the $2.6 million increase in gross profit. These factors were partially offset by non-cash asset impairment charges of $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, related to the decommissioning of the tote filling equipment and the early retirement of certain non-production assets. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.8 million for the third quarter of 2025 compared with a loss of $6.2 million in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders was $0.01 for the third quarter compared with diluted loss per share of $0.05 in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings¹ from continuing operations were $6.0 million or $0.05 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2025 compared to adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.8 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA¹ from continuing operations was $23.6 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $20.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, driven by strong volume growth. Please refer to the discussion and table below under “Non-GAAP Measures”. As of September 27, 2025, SunOpta had total assets of $694.1 million and total debt of $265.8 million compared to total assets of $668.5 million and total debt of $265.2 million at year end fiscal 2024. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $34.1 million compared to $19.2 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. The increase mainly reflected increased net earnings driven by increased gross profit and reductions in selling, general and administrative expenditures, partially offset by increases in working capital. Investing activities of continuing operations consumed $22.9 million of cash during the first three quarters of fiscal 2025 compared to $16.5 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, reflecting non-recurring proceeds from the sale of the smoothie bowl product line included in the prior year period. Net leverage1 was 2.8x, compared to 3.0x at the end of fiscal 2024 and we expect to maintain this ratio of net leverage through the end of the fiscal year. Tariffs continue to be an evolving situation that we continue to monitor. While our employees, production facilities, and customers are predominately located in the U.S. (in 2024, 98% of revenue was to U.S. based customers), we source a portion of our raw material ingredients and packaging globally, and a portion of our fruit snack products are imported into the U.S. from our Niagara, Ontario, facility that are not exempt under USMCA. In response to these new tariffs, we have been implementing alternative sourcing strategies and pricing arrangements that have allowed us to mitigate our known tariff exposure at this time, although the long-term tariff environment remains uncertain. The Company is updating its outlook for 2025 and providing an initial outlook for 2026. The Company now expects: ($ millions) | Prior 2025 | Updated | 2026 | || Revenue | $805 – 815 | $812 – 816 | $865 – 880 | || Adj. EBITDA | $99 – 103 | $90 – 92 | $102 – 108 | SunOpta plans to host a conference call at 5:30 P.M. Eastern time on Wednesday, November 5, 2025, to discuss the third quarter financial results.

These non–GAAP financial measures are derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of the aforementioned forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measures. Historically, management has excluded the following items from certain of these non-GAAP measures, and such items may also be excluded in future periods and could be significant amounts. - Expenses related to the acquisition or divestiture of a business, including business development costs, impairment of assets, integration costs, severance, retention costs and transaction costs; - Charges associated with restructuring and cost saving initiatives, including but not limited to asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, severance costs and lease abandonment charges; - Asset impairment charges and facility closure costs; - Legal settlements or awards; and - The tax effect of the above items.

"Canada adds surprise 67,000 jobs in October, unemployment rate drops to 6.9% OTTAWA — Canada’s labour market caught economists off guard with a second straight month of surprise job gains in October. Statistics Canada said Friday the economy added 67,000 jobs in October, good enough to drive the unemployment rate down two tenths of a percentage point to 6.9 per cent. October’s growth was driven by part-time work with 85,000 positions added, coming off solid gains in full-time work in September. The private sector meanwhile added 73,000 jobs for its first gain since June. Economists polled by Reuters ahead of Friday’s release expected Canada’s labour market would take a breather with a loss of 2,500 jobs in October, following a surprise gain of 60,000 positions in September. Job gains across October and September now more than offset sharp drops observed in August and July. TD Bank senior economist Leslie Preston leaned on baseball metaphors in a note to clients Friday, calling the back-to-back monthly job gains a “double.” “The labour market is proving a bit more resilient to trade tensions than we had expected, but October’s data is not a home run,” Preston said. The wholesale and retail trade sector saw the most growth with 41,000 positions added in October, followed by transportation and warehousing with 30,000 jobs and the information, culture and recreation sector with 25,000 roles. Tariff-sensitive manufacturing posted a gain of 8,700 positions in October while construction lost 15,000 jobs. StatCan said goods-producing industries have shed 54,000 positions on net since January — when uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs and global trade started to ramp up — while the services side of the economy had added 142,000 jobs over that time. Ontario, a province hit hard by the trade war, led job growth provincially with 55,000 positions added. Manufacturing-heavy Windsor’s unemployment rate peaked at 11.2 per cent in June but has since trended down to 9.6 per cent, according to three-month moving averages. Young workers saw some relief in October after struggling for months in a tough labour market as youth aged 15 to 24 saw 21,000 jobs added last month, the first gain since January. That drove the youth jobless rate down 0.6 percentage points to 14.1 per cent in October after reaching a 15-year high in September, outside the pandemic. Average hourly wages were up 3.5 per cent annually in October, accelerating from 3.3 per cent the month before. While wages heated up on a monthly basis, Preston noted pay hikes have cooled from last year’s pace and the unemployment rate remains elevated in a still-soft hiring environment. “While this report shows some resilience in Canada’s labour market, it is not strength,” she said. The Bank of Canada will be parsing labour data closely as it prepares for its final interest rate decision of the year on Dec. 10, though the central bank will also get a look at November’s jobs figures before making that call. The bank’s benchmark interest rate stands at 2.25 per cent following a pair of consecutive cuts. Governor Tiff Macklem signalled last month that the central bank may be satisfied with where the benchmark interest rate stands unless incoming economic data strays from its forecasts. “Overall, today’s data is supportive of the Bank of Canada’s thinking that interest rates are now low enough to stimulate the economy, and we continue to forecast no more rate cuts from here,” said CIBC senior economist Andrew Grantham in a note. Preston agreed that October’s job figures should give comfort to the Bank of Canada that it can sit on the sidelines while the stimulative forces from previous rate cuts work their way through the economy.

"U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Sunday that potential one-time payments of $2,000 from tariff revenues would not fuel inflation and could provide welcome relief to families. ""This is real money that's coming in, and we get to decide what to do with it,"" Greer told ""Fox & Friends Weekend."" ""The $2,000, that's one option,"" Greer said, adding that President Donald Trump is ""eager to discuss and explore more"" proposals. TRUMP CALLS TARIFF OPPONENTS 'FOOLS,' PROMISES $2K DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FOR AMERICANS Greer dismissed concerns that the move would stoke rising prices, noting that ""this is not some kind of ongoing new welfare program or something that would exacerbate inflation."" He added that he expects American families to welcome the checks. ""But I don’t think it would change the overall macroeconomic picture,"" Greer said. Trump vowed earlier this month that revenue generated from duties could fund a $2,000 dividend for low- and middle-income Americans. TRUMP SAYS TARIFF-FUNDED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FOR AMERICANS WILL BEGIN NEXT YEAR The president first floated the idea on Nov. 9 and has since suggested that any remaining funds could be used to help pay down the nation’s soaring $38 trillion debt. Last week, Trump said Americans could see payment checks as soon as next year. ""We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money. We're going to be issuing dividends probably by the middle of next year, maybe a little bit later than that,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. TRUMP SAYS TARIFF REVENUE TO FUND $2K CHECKS FOR AMERICANS, LOWER NATION’S $38T DEBT Since Trump announced his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs in April, tariff revenues have climbed sharply from $23.9 billion in May to $28 billion in June and $29 billion in July. Total duty revenue reached $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, which ended Sept. 30, according to the Treasury Department’s ""Customs and Certain Excise Taxes"" report. So far in fiscal year 2026, which began on Oct. 1, the U.S. has collected $40.4 billion, according to the latest numbers published by the Treasury Department. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The proposal comes at a pivotal moment, with tariff receipts climbing and the Supreme Court reviewing the legality of Trump’s trade measures, a case that could determine the future of his broader trade agenda.",right
"Supreme Court Confronts Trump's Power to Disrupt World Trade President Donald Trump has worked fast in his second term, wielding unilateral power to reassert American dominance in the global economy. For a few hours Wednesday, the world will get clues as to whether any US institution is willing to rein him in. (Bloomberg) — President Donald Trump has worked fast in his second term, wielding unilateral power to reassert American dominance in the global economy. For a few hours Wednesday, the world will get clues as to whether any US institution is willing to rein him in. In a high-stakes legal showdown, the Supreme Court will consider arguments that Trump exceeded his constitutional authority with many of the sweeping tariffs he has imposed on goods from around the world. Hanging in the balance are tens of billions of dollars in duties now paid monthly by American importers, and Trump’s ability to reshape global flows of goods and capital. Legal scholars say the implications extend far beyond the economic consequences to the very reach of the US presidency. If Trump wins he would have virtually unlimited power to invoke emergencies to impose import taxes and intervene in the economy, both the president and his critics say. A loss will undermine his favorite economic tool, one that’s been a source of financial market volatility this year. A ruling isn’t expected for weeks or even months, raising the prospect of uncertainty extending through year-end holidays. Trump himself, in a social media post Tuesday, called the case “LIFE OR DEATH for our Country” and said a ruling against him would leave the US “virtually defenseless.” The president argues that limiting his tariff power would undermine deals he has struck with trading partners aimed at rebalancing relationships and boosting US manufacturing. “Our economy will go to hell,” he said in a CBS interview broadcast Sunday when asked what would happen if he lost. Betting markets this week assigned about a 60% chance of Trump losing the case. Wall Street firms have also been buying up the rights to potential refunds, betting a loss for Trump would see billions in tariffs returned to companies. The central issue before the high court is whether to agree with lower courts that found the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give presidents the power to impose tariffs. That would mean most of Trump’s import taxes are illegal. In multiple executive orders and during his April 2 announcement in the Rose Garden, Trump invoked the 1977 law to tax goods from most of the world. In the case of China — as well as Canada and Mexico — he cited a fentanyl crisis, and for other countries a persistent US trade deficit that many economists argue is far from an emergency. He’s also used the IEEPA to impose punitive tariffs on Brazilian imports over the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro for plotting a coup, and on Indian goods because of the country’s purchases of Russian oil. Most recently he threatened Canada with additional duties under the statute over a television ad featuring a 1987 Ronald Reagan address decrying the use of tariffs. Unbridled Powers The small businesses and states that brought the three cases being jointly heard by the Supreme Court argue that while IEEPA has been correctly used to impose other financial sanctions, it does not allow presidents to levy tariffs. No other president has done so, they point out. The law itself was part of a Watergate-era wave of congressional action to put boundaries on presidential powers. The absence of the word “tariffs” from its text is a deliberate omission that shows Congress didn’t delegate its constitutional powers to collect duties and regulate international commerce, lawyers opposing Trump’s tariffs say. While the final verdict may be some way off, clues to which way justices are leaning often emerge during exchanges in oral arguments. Any ruling against Trump may only bring a temporary halt to his trade wars, experts say. There are other, more legally solid authorities he can use, as he did during his first term and has again this year with duties on specific products such as cars or steel. But Trump’s enthusiasm for the IEEPA as a pillar of his second-term agenda arose from his belief it gave him unbridled powers. Other tariff-granting statutes require investigations and can take as long as nine months to come together. ‘Mind-Blowing’ Invalidating most of Trump’s import taxes could be disruptive. The US is collecting $556 million daily in IEEPA tariffs, accounting for 75% of additional customs revenue this year, according to a Bloomberg Economics analysis. The total take from IEEPA duties alone is set to exceed $140 billion in 2025, even after Trump announced a deal last week to halve the 20% fentanyl tariffs on Chinese imports. Were the Supreme Court to throw out all of Trump’s IEEPA taxes, it would reduce the effective tariff rate to 6.5% from 15.9% currently, Bloomberg Economics calculates. That would halve the drag on US growth, though rates would remain significantly higher than the 2.3% level when Trump returned to office in January. One key question is whether, if Trump loses his Supreme Court case, his government would be ordered to refund the tariffs, which would deprive the Treasury of revenue and push the budget deficit higher. Kent Smetters, a Treasury official under former President George W. Bush now at the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said refunds could actually provide an economic tailwind in the short run. Returning the cash to companies would cushion profits and free up funds for new investment, he said. That’ll depend on the federal bureaucracy’s ability to handle such a request. Jess Nepstad, who runs Planetary Design, a coffee accessory business based in Montana, said he was wrongly overcharged by $200,000 on a recent shipment of imports. The company was able to prove to Customs and Border Protection that the bill was an error, but the agency said it would take 300 days to pay him back. “If all this gets repealed, how long is it going to take for all of us businesses to get our money back?” Nepstad said during a conference call last week organized by a coalition of small businesses opposed to the tariffs. “It’s going to be mind-blowing.” ‘Who Holds Power’ Beyond the Main Street and Wall Street consequences are the Constitution’s “bright lines” between legislative and executive power and the erosion of democratic accountability, according to an amicus brief filed earlier this year by a bipartisan group of constitutional law experts including former federal judges and three former US senators. “This dispute is not about the wisdom of tariffs or the politics of trade,” they wrote. “It is about who holds the power to tax the American people.” Michael McConnell, the conservative Stanford University constitutional law professor who wrote that brief and who’s since joined the legal team of one of the plaintiffs, calls the case before the Supreme Court this week the most significant since 1952 related to presidential economic powers. That year, justices blocked the attempted nationalization of a steel company by the Truman administration, which invoked national security and the Korean War. Trump administration officials say any ruling against him would impinge on the president’s ability to conduct foreign affairs. Nothing, they argue, should interfere with presidential authority to declare an emergency if he chooses, whether over the fentanyl crisis or trade deficits. That the case is being debated publicly on the same day a US government shutdown reached the longest on record provided a measure of support for one of Trump’s more populist arguments: that Congress is too plodding and partisan to compete with his style of deal-making diplomacy. “They can’t approve anything,” he said in the CBS interview. “They would be sitting around for years debating whether or not we should use tariffs.” In a brief filed last week on Trump’s behalf, US Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote that the IEEPA gave the president the authority to respond to any threats he saw as long as he first declared an emergency. It didn’t put limits on what the president could deem an emergency, Sauer argued. Moreover, courts couldn’t review any such decision because “judges lack institutional competence to determine when foreign threats are unusual or extraordinary.” If the court endorsed such a view, the plaintiffs argue, it would give Trump and his successors virtually unlimited power to govern by emergency rule. —With assistance from Catherine Lucey and Greg Stohr.

"Listen to this article in summarized format The transaction fetched approximately Rs 7,194.4 crore at the offer price. The deal represents 0.56% of Bharti Airtel’s equity. The final price for the sale was set at Rs 2,097.50 per share, implying a discount of roughly 3% to the previous closing price of Rs 2,161.60 on NSE. As of September 2025, ICIL held a 1.48% stake in the telecom major. Upon completion of this block deal, the promoter’s stake is expected to fall below the 1% mark. In line with regulatory requirements, ICIL will be subjected to a 90-day lock-up period on the remaining shares post-transaction. Goldman Sachs (India) Securities has been appointed as the sole placement agent for the sale. This development follows a similar move earlier in the month by Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (Singtel), which sold about a 0.8% stake in Bharti Airtel as part of its broader strategy to streamline its regional telecom investments. The block deal comes shortly after Bharti Airtel reported a robust second-quarter performance. The company posted a 6% quarter-on-quarter rise in consolidated EBITDA, supported by strong growth in its India wireless and Airtel Africa businesses. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), a key profitability metric, rose ahead of expectations, while consolidated free cash flow remained solid at Rs 14,600 crore. Bharti Airtel also confirmed that its FY26 India capex, excluding investments in Indus Towers, is expected to moderate from FY25 levels, which could enhance cash generation going forward. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal recently reiterated a “Buy” rating on Bharti Airtel with a target price of Rs 2,365. The brokerage highlighted strong operational performance across both domestic and African markets. It projects a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% and 18% in revenue and EBITDA, respectively, over FY25–28, supported by tariff hikes, growth in broadband services, and strength in its Africa operations. Despite a 35% rally in the stock year-to-date—well above the Nifty’s 9% gain—Motilal Oswal believes Bharti Airtel’s risk-reward profile remains attractive. Potential upside triggers include a possible revision in tariffs, which could further strengthen the company’s earnings and balance sheet position.

"Only US Lawmaker at COP30 Tells Nations to Stand Up to Trump Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the only representative of the US federal government showing up at this year’s United Nations climate summit, has a simple message for the almost 200 countries gathered in Brazil: When you’re facing President Donald Trump’s ire, don’t back down. (Bloomberg) — Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the only representative of the US federal government showing up at this year’s United Nations climate summit, has a simple message for the almost 200 countries gathered in Brazil: When you’re facing President Donald Trump’s ire, don’t back down. The Democratic senator used his whirlwind visit to the COP30 conference to call on countries to show resolve and stay committed to their climate plans. He also pressed the European Union to stick with its carbon levies even as the bloc negotiates with the US on broader trade tariffs. “Once a bully knows that he can push you around, he is going to continue to push you around,” Whitehouse said in an interview on the sidelines of the COP30 summit for Bloomberg’s Zero podcast. It’s important “to stand firm against the bully.” Trump has shunned the summit in the rainforest city of Belém and derided its goal to combat climate change as a “hoax.” And while several US lawmakers had been making plans to attend, a weeks-long dispute over government funding stymied travel plans. Even Whitehouse’s attendance was far from guaranteed, after the US State Department declined requests to facilitate “party overflow” badges to attend the conference, despite helping in Trump’s first term. That forced the senator and his staff to seek out other credentials. For Whitehouse, 70, a climate champion who has used a series of Senate speeches to warn about the need for action, a central goal is putting a price on the carbon dioxide emissions that are fueling climate change — and preserving the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism that addresses that pollution. Whitehouse describes the EU’s so-called CBAM as “a last lifeboat,” citing analysis by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research on available pathways to counter warming that underscored the importance of carbon pricing. The EU’s carbon levy was designed so that the bloc’s heaviest-emitting industries — including steel and cement — wouldn’t simply relocate to other nations with weaker climate rules as it accelerates towards net-zero. Beginning next year, imports of goods covered by the bloc’s CBAM will face an extra fee if they come from a country whose carbon dioxide pricing isn’t considered equivalent to the EU’s. The proportion of goods covered will gradually increase over the next decade as the bloc tightens rules at home. However, the trade war that erupted in the first few months of Trump’s second term has led to doubts about the future of the mechanism. The US and EU have inked a trade agreement the Trump administration said includes “addressing non-tariff barriers that might restrict bilateral energy trade,” and the bloc could come under additional pressure to unwind the levy. “The Trumpsters are probably going to try and attack it,” Whitehouse predicted. “What the CBAM folks need to do is to understand that they’re coming and be ready to steel themselves for that fight, to be prepared and to understand that they can’t let individual countries chicken out and be picked off,” he said. Whitehouse’s comments came just days after seven Senate Democrats and one Democratic-aligned independent broke with the rest of the party to back a new stopgap spending bill in Washington, helping to end a 43-day impasse over government funding in exchange for a Senate vote on extending health care subsidies by the middle of December. The move has drawn criticism from some liberal leaders as an embarrassing retreat from the protracted spending fight that handed Trump a win while failing to net major concessions. Whitehouse says it offers a lesson for countries in Europe and elsewhere that could face Trump administration criticism for their climate policies. “If you are resolute in standing up against him, and if you’re a group and you stand together and don’t back away, so he can’t pick off individuals, he will move on to something else,” Whitehouse said. “You will do better at standing fast and refusing to be bullied,” he said. Although the US hasn’t sent delegates to the COP30 summit, it mounted an intense campaign — complete with tariff and visa threats — against what would have been the world’s first-ever fixed global carbon tax on shipping earlier this year. Ultimately, the Trump administration effort succeeded in delaying a vote to adopt the levy by at least a year. Whitehouse called it a “brutal and devilish attack” on the International Maritime Organization with “unprecedented levels of diplomatic bullying,” even though he said the proposed shipping fee would have a “negligible” price effect on American consumers. “I hope that’s a lesson for other international groups that you really have to steel yourself and not allow yourself to be panicked and picked off,” he said. “They picked some of the weaker members off first and began to take advantage of that. I think if the IMO had seen that attack coming, they might have been more resolute about standing up.” European leaders have maintained resolve, arguing they won’t back down from the carbon border adjustment, even as key exporters to the EU criticize it and amid a COP30 push to discuss so-called unilateral trade measures. The EU also has been one of the driving forces behind a so-called carbon market coalition unveiled at the summit to help propagate carbon markets globally. Under the CBAM, in the EU, emitting a ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere carries a price of around €80 ($93). “We’re not going to be lured into the suggestion that actually CBAM is a unilateral trade measure, and in that realm we’re not going to discuss it,” Wopke Hoekstra, the EU’s climate commissioner, said at a press conference in Brazil. “CBAM will go into effect on Jan. 1.” —With assistance from John Ainger.

"If the White House handing out $2,000 checks to all U.S. citizens sounded too good to be true, it just might be. At least, that’s now the sentiment among bettors. Earlier this month, President Trump made an official promise of a “dividend” payable to all Americans. Posting on Truth Social, the social media platform he owns, the president wrote that tariff opponents were “fools” and added: “record investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place.” He continued: “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.” Since then, excitement around the project has dimmed. According to speculators betting on the odds market site Kalshi, there’s now just a 2% chance that Americans will receive such a check anytime soon. These odds have dropped considerably from the week following Trump’s announcement, when the market priced a more than 13% likelihood of the rebates being paid out. Indeed, the odds tracker isn’t even assuming the promise of a $2,000 check—it’s based on the odds of a million Americans being given notice of an $1,000 check, and the verified details being reported (not the payouts completed) by Jan. 1. Over at Polymarket, the crypto-based probability trading platform, the odds of Americans receiving a check before Dec. 31 have fallen to just 1%, down from 50% on Nov. 15. In the days since President Trump made the pledge, members of his cabinet have poured cold water on the plans. On ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Nov. 9, shortly after the post from Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent admitted he hadn’t yet talked to the president about the dividend plan, adding it would require Congress to pass legislation. Bessent also attempted to unpick the form the tariff stimulus would take, perhaps not a check but in relief already signed into law: “The $2,000 dividend could come in lots of forms…it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president’s agenda. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans. Those are substantial deductions that are being financed in the tax bill.” Doing the math Bessent’s caution may be justified, as the president has also stated that some tariff revenue will also go toward paying down America’s “enormous” $38 trillion national debt burden. While tariffs are bringing in a significant sum—approximately $30 billion a month by September 2025—that revenue is minor compared even to the interest the U.S. government is paying to service its debt. Treasury data shows the interest paid on national debt for FY2025 is $1.22 trillion, and rising every year. Even if President Trump’s tariff collection continues to rake in $30 billion a month and $360 billion a year, this still amounts to a little over a third of the interest payments on the debt—it doesn’t touch the debt itself. Trump’s $2,000 plan is also eye-wateringly costly. Even if the government were to pay each household—as opposed to each individual—in the bottom 50% of earners, that would still require payouts to more than 67.5 million homes, per data from the St. Louis Fed. That would imply that $135 billion, nearly half of the tariff revenues, would immediately be paid out to citizens instead of being directed toward national debt. Yet despite further caveats from Bessent in the past few days, Trump doubled down on the plan yesterday. “We’re going to be issuing dividends later on, somewhere prior to…probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, according to Axios. The payments, he said, would go to “individuals of moderate income, middle income.”",right
"Interest rates at low end of ideal balance between growth and inflation: Macklem TORONTO — The head of the Bank of Canada says he thinks interest rates are at the lower end of where they can go as he tries to balance boosting the tariff-hit economy and keeping inflation in check. Speaking at a conference in Toronto, Governor Tiff Macklem says tariffs are a slower-moving pressure than some crises, but that they are likely to put pressure on prices over time. The inflation risk means that while Canada’s economy could use the boost of lower interest rates, he’s limited in how much further he could push them down. The Bank of Canada lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25 per cent last Wednesday. Macklem says the rate is now at the low end of the central bank’s neutral range, meaning it provides some stimulus while keeping inflation well controlled. He says the country needs to work on long-standing productivity issues to raise incomes enough to make up for the recent bout of elevated inflation, but that tariffs are also making that harder. Based on current conditions though, lower interest rates don’t seem to be the answer, he said. “We think monetary policy is in about the right place to provide some support, while keeping inflation well controlled,” he said. “Our priority is to make sure that the tariff problem doesn’t become an inflation problem.” He made sure not to offer any policy recommendations that he would like to see in Tuesday’s federal budget, but broadly talked of the need to reduce internal trade barriers and boost transportation corridors as part of lowering the cost of business. “If there’s more income, things become more affordable, but that is going to take some hard decisions.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 3, 2025.

"India's purchase of LPG from the US has an impact on rebalancing trade between the two countries and on ongoing tariff negotiations. Although the deal is not part of trade talks, it does facilitate their resolution. India and the US are trying to hammer out a deal that addresses Washington's concerns over tariffs and dependence on Russian energy exports. The Trump regime has slapped 25% reciprocal tariffs and an additional 25% penal duty over Russian crude oil imports. Energy imports from the US, of which LPG purchase represents a small but significant beginning, address both the US concerns and should help with tariff revocation. Indian exports to its largest trading partner could recover from the tariff hit they had taken earlier in the year as trade negotiations stalled over granting the US greater market access in agricultural products. Energy, along with arms, is a low-hanging fruit for an India-US trade reset. Dependence on Russian energy was brought on by Western sanctions following the outbreak of war in Ukraine. The global oil market would have been upended had India not stepped up imports of Ural crude replacing traditional suppliers in the Persian Gulf. The only way the US can alter the situation is by offering its own energy exports to India as support. Washington does not have enough influence over oil-producing nations to get them to keep prices stable and force India off Russian crude at the same time. In the event, the LPG export order represents a US acceptance of economic reality and India's determination to pursue an independent energy security policy. Food and energy security are among India's major concerns, and it is bound to oppose pressure from any quarter that might make either item more expensive for Indian consumers. Food prices are a more sensitive area and Indian negotiators will find it easier to make concessions over energy imports. The US side will likewise be able to achieve its intended outcome without having to push deeper into no-go areas in farm trade.

"India’s economy grew at the fastest pace in six quarters, underscoring its resilience even as US President Donald Trump’s steep tariffs cloud the outlook. Gross domestic product rose 8.2%in the three months through September from a year earlier, the Statistics Ministry said Friday, beating all 38 estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists and much faster than the 7.4% median forecast. The economy had expanded 7.8% in the April–June quarter. In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the GDP number “very encouraging,” saying it reflects the impact of the government’s “pro-growth policies and reforms.” India’s sovereign five-year bond yield rose as much as 8 basis points to 6.24% on Friday, as markets took the strong data as reducing the chances of an interest rate cut at next week’s policy meeting. Economists such as Sonal Varma of Nomura Holdings had earlier expected the Reserve Bank of India to cut rates on Dec. 5, but she now says it may be a “close call.” “India’s Goldilocks macro mix — high growth, low inflation — is unique,” Varma said. As a result of the robust data, full-year growth is now projected to be at least 7%, up from6.3%-6.8% earlier, V. Anantha Nageswaran, India’s Chief Economic Advisor, told reporters in New Delhi. While the numbers will be a major boost for Modi, many economists do not expect the momentum to last through the remaining quarters if uncertainty over a trade deal with the US lingers. India, which faces a 50% tariff rate, is among the last major economies yet to sign a trade agreement with Washington. A jump in manufacturing — which expanded at its fastest pace in more than a year — along with stronger financial services activity drove the better-than-expected outcome last quarter. Analysts said the data also suggest the economy benefited from the 100 basis points of interest rate cuts delivered by the central bank earlier this year. The data confirms that “India will remain the world’s fastest growing economy, and the supportive fiscal and monetary policies seem to be contributing to a long-awaited revival of investment demand,” said Shumita Deveshwar, chief economist at GlobalData.TS Lombard. Modi is trying to shore up growth by spurring consumer and business spending. His government introduced major tax cuts in September, which boosted demand ahead of the festival season. Private consumption, which accounts for almost 60% of GDP, jumped 7.9% last quarter from a year ago. Manufacturing sector grew 9.1%. Government expenditure fell 2.7% in order to stay on track toward its budget deficit target as the tax cuts eroded revenue. “Support this quarter has come from stocking up ahead of the festive season by producers,” said Sakshi Gupta, an economist at HDFC Bank Ltd. Exporters also advanced shipments ahead of Trump’s tariffs taking effect in August, which contributed to the boost, she said. However, the momentum might fade in the coming quarters. “What remains uncertain is whether the jump up in demand seen during the festive season would sustain over the coming months, especially given that urban hiring trends remain tentative.” Gupta said. Some economists also said the data may have been boosted by statistical effects such as a lower deflator, used to strip out inflation from economic output. “Discrepancies have also contributed significantly to headline GDP growth this quarter,” Varma of Nomura said. A prolonged stalemate on a US trade deal is also weighing heavily on the outlook. Exports contracted nearly 12% in October from a year earlier, with shipments to the US down 8.6%, data released earlier this month showed. The International Monetary Fund has lowered its projection for India’s growth next financial year to 6.2%on the assumption that high US tariffs will remain in place. Still, officials in New Delhi have repeatedly said in recent weeks that an agreement is close. Just before the GDP data were released on Friday, a senior official said India is optimistic it will strike an initial deal with Washington by next month to bring down reciprocal tariffs.",right
"The government on Tuesday said it is taking steps, such as announcing an export promotion mission, to mitigate the impact of the steep US tariffs on domestic goods. In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Jitin Prasada said it is expected that these measures will enhance diversification and resilience in India's trade relationships. ""The government continues to work to mitigate the impact of the US tariff measures on Indian exports through a comprehensive multi-pronged strategy encompassing intensive engagement with the US government for a mutually beneficial India-US Bilateral Trade Agreement,"" he said. He added that immediate relief has been given through trade relief measures of the RBI and announcement of the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Exporters, enhancement of domestic demand through GST reforms, and negotiating free trade agreements (FTAs) with new countries. On July 31 this year, the US issued an executive order with reciprocal tariff rates for its trading partners. The order notified country-specific additional ad-valorem duty rates for certain American trading partners, including those which have agreed to, or are in the process of concluding trade agreements with them. These tariffs are in the range of 15-41 per cent, with the tariff on India being 25 per cent. It came into effect on August 7. The US, on August 6, imposed an additional tariff of 25 per cent on India, citing its purchase of Russian oil. The tariffs took effect on August 27. These tariffs apply to products in sectors such as textiles, handicrafts, leather, certain agricultural items, marine products and engineering goods, the minister informed. About the export promotion mission, Prasada said the mission will provide a comprehensive, flexible, and digitally driven framework for export promotion, with a total outlay of Rs 25,060 crore for 2025-26 to 2030-31. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also initiated trade relief measures for eligible affected exporters, including provision for debt repayment moratorium and extension of tenor for export credit, he added. With an aim for promotion of export diversification, India has signed 15 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and six Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) with its trading partners. ""Government is working with all stakeholders to enable our exporters to better utilize the benefits of India's FTAs with major markets such as Japan, Korea, UAE and effectively utilize the opportunities that have been created with the recently concluded FTAs,"" he said. The government is also engaged in negotiations for early conclusion of mutually beneficial FTAs with the EU, Peru, Chile, New Zealand, and Oman. ""The government remains engaged with all stakeholders, including exporters, Export Promotion Councils, industry associations, and state governments to assess the evolving impact of the US tariff measures,"" he said. In a separate reply, the minister said the Department of Commerce is actively engaged with all stakeholders, including industry associations of the affected sectors such as textiles and apparel, gems and jewellery, leather, marine, chemicals and engineering goods, to assess the evolving impact of the US tariff measures. Continuous consultations are being held to gather feedback, evaluate sector-specific stress and identify both immediate and structural interventions required to safeguard India's trade interests, he added. ""However, given the dynamic nature of the situation, the relatively short period of less than three months since the imposition of these tariffs and the multiple factors affecting economic outcomes, it is difficult to exactly isolate the impact of the US tariffs, if any, on the variables,"" Prasada said. India's exports to the US increased to USD 52.12 billion during April-October this fiscal year from USD 47.32 billion in the same period last year. In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Jitin Prasada said it is expected that these measures will enhance diversification and resilience in India's trade relationships. ""The government continues to work to mitigate the impact of the US tariff measures on Indian exports through a comprehensive multi-pronged strategy encompassing intensive engagement with the US government for a mutually beneficial India-US Bilateral Trade Agreement,"" he said.

The order notified country-specific additional ad-valorem duty rates for certain American trading partners, including those which have agreed to, or are in the process of concluding trade agreements with them. These tariffs are in the range of 15-41 per cent, with the tariff on India being 25 per cent. It came into effect on August 7. The US, on August 6, imposed an additional tariff of 25 per cent on India, citing its purchase of Russian oil. The tariffs took effect on August 27. These tariffs apply to products in sectors such as textiles, handicrafts, leather, certain agricultural items, marine products and engineering goods, the minister informed. About the export promotion mission, Prasada said the mission will provide a comprehensive, flexible, and digitally driven framework for export promotion, with a total outlay of Rs 25,060 crore for 2025-26 to 2030-31. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also initiated trade relief measures for eligible affected exporters, including provision for debt repayment moratorium and extension of tenor for export credit, he added. With an aim for promotion of export diversification, India has signed 15 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and six Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) with its trading partners. ""Government is working with all stakeholders to enable our exporters to better utilize the benefits of India's FTAs with major markets such as Japan, Korea, UAE and effectively utilize the opportunities that have been created with the recently concluded FTAs,"" he said. The government is also engaged in negotiations for early conclusion of mutually beneficial FTAs with the EU, Peru, Chile, New Zealand, and Oman. ""The government remains engaged with all stakeholders, including exporters, Export Promotion Councils, industry associations, and state governments to assess the evolving impact of the US tariff measures,"" he said. In a separate reply, the minister said the Department of Commerce is actively engaged with all stakeholders, including industry associations of the affected sectors such as textiles and apparel, gems and jewellery, leather, marine, chemicals and engineering goods, to assess the evolving impact of the US tariff measures. Continuous consultations are being held to gather feedback, evaluate sector-specific stress and identify both immediate and structural interventions required to safeguard India's trade interests, he added. ""However, given the dynamic nature of the situation, the relatively short period of less than three months since the imposition of these tariffs and the multiple factors affecting economic outcomes, it is difficult to exactly isolate the impact of the US tariffs, if any, on the variables,"" Prasada said. India's exports to the US increased to USD 52.12 billion during April-October this fiscal year from USD 47.32 billion in the same period last year.",right
"GE Appliances bolsters ties with US suppliers as it moves production from China to Kentucky LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — GE Appliances on Thursday touted wide-ranging ripple effects from shifting production from China to Kentucky as it announced more than $150 million in new contracts awarded to U.S.-based suppliers. The supplier contracts range in value from $330,000 to $41 million, span 10 states and cover crucial segments of the supplier chain for the appliance maker’s washer and dryer production — from plastics and castings to steel and aluminum, the company said. The suppliers range in size from U.S. Steel to family-owned companies. With the new contracts, GE Appliances said it is increasing domestic spending on suppliers by 3.3%. The suppliers will support production of a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers, all of which GE Appliances is moving from China to its sprawling Louisville complex known as Appliance Park. The company says it’s investing $490 million to retool a plant for the project, which will create 800 new jobs. Production is scheduled to begin in early 2027, it said, and will expand the total footprint devoted to clothes care production at Appliance Park to the equivalent of 33 football fields. “When we invest in U.S. manufacturing and our people, it drives growth far beyond our own walls,” Lee Lagomarcino, a GE Appliances vice president, said Thursday in a news release. “These new supplier contracts represent what ‘Built for America’ is all about — investing in U.S. manufacturing, creating more American jobs and building opportunity that multiplies.” The announcements come as President Donald Trump attempts to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes _ tariffs — on foreign goods. The president recently said the U.S. would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20% to 10%. That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57% to 47%. The $150 million-plus in new supplier contracts reflects the amount GE Appliances will spend each year for shipments of parts, components and raw materials to produce the washers and dryers, it said. Contract values could increase if sales of the washers and dryers grow, the company said. GE Appliances said it spends $4.6 billion with more than 6,500 U.S. suppliers, a 69% increase in spending and a 58% rise in its number of suppliers since 2019. Its U.S. supply chain has grown for more than a decade, it said. “While tariffs have certainly been a factor, there are also many other benefits such as shorter lead times, reduced transportation costs and the ability to collaborate with your supply chain to ultimately serve our customers better,” Lagomarcino said. The new contracts were awarded to businesses in Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Alabama and California, GE Appliances said. It awarded more than $40 million in contracts to suppliers in Kentucky, more than in any other state. The contracts are the first of many expected ripple effects from its broader, five-year, $3 billion commitment to strengthen its U.S. manufacturing, reshore certain production and create more than 1,000 jobs, the company said. GE Appliances announced plans in August to shift production of refrigerators, gas ranges and water heaters out of China and Mexico. The company also has manufacturing plants in South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Connecticut. The company is a subsidiary of the China-based Haier company.

"European Earnings Defy Gloomy Predictions, Fueling Stocks Rally European third-quarter earnings have exceeded expectations across the board, supporting stocks at record highs and boosting sentiment on the outlook for 2026. (Bloomberg) — European third-quarter earnings have exceeded expectations across the board, supporting stocks at record highs and boosting sentiment on the outlook for 2026. With the reporting season nearly over, earnings-per-share growth for the MSCI Europe Index is running at 5.7%, compared with expectations for no increase at all, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence shows. Almost half of companies have topped earnings estimates, prompting more guidance upgrades than downgrades and defying fears around tariff turmoil and currency headwinds. “The earnings season continues to deliver,” said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by Guillaume Jaisson. “Guidance has largely been confirmed. As a result, consensus estimates for 2025 and 2026 are stabilizing or improving.” Caution among analysts over this year’s earnings looks to have been misplaced as low interest rates, cost cutting, price hikes and a recovering economy helped companies deliver beats. As a result, European equity benchmarks have surged, with the Stoxx Europe 600 up 14% this year. Banks have been the standout performers, with gains of 55%, powered by strong results and buybacks. Consensus expectations for 2026 point to earnings growth of 11%, followed by 12% in 2027, as European governments ramp up fiscal stimulus and economic growth continues to recover. That compares relatively well with the 12% and 14% expected for members of the S&P 500. Even with the positive tone around earnings, European stocks do not appear expensive. While valuations have risen to the highest level in about four years, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 15, they remain well below their post-pandemic peak. Meanwhile, the Stoxx 600 still trades at an extreme 35% discount to the S&P 500. Banks and energy companies have driven most of the upside for earnings — the former supported by solid net interest income and lower loan-loss provisions while a drag on the latter from weaker oil prices has eased. UK lenders Barclays Plc, NatWest Group Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc have led the charge, with their margin resilience standing out as they surprised the most positively. With the sector returning roughly a tenfold number of beats to misses, European banks’ five-year earnings upgrade cycle looks likely to extend deep into 2026, said BI senior analyst Philip Richards. While energy companies still largely missed revenue expectations, improving refining margins bolstered bottom lines, with UK-listed Shell Plc, BP Plc as well as Italy’s Eni SpA the main contributors to the EPS beat. BP’s profit exceeded expectations in the third quarter, lifting confidence in its turnaround, while Shell also delivered better-than-expected profit and free cash flow. Even Europe’s beleaguered automotive sector started to show the signs of recovery after a series of profit warnings this year, with cost cuts and turnaround plans prompting analysts to raise profit estimates. Though earnings still declined both year-over-year and sequentially, the sector surprised positively for the first time in five quarters, Deutsche Bank AG’s head of European equity and cross asset strategy Maximilian Uleer noted. Margin resilience and artificial intelligence-driven efficiency gains were evident across industries, with discussions about AI in earnings calls reaching the highest on record in the quarter, BI analysis shows. “AI is no longer a niche theme, but a key driver of productivity and profitability as 2026 beckons,” said BI strategists Laurent Douillet and Kaidi Meng. Technology companies remained the most vocal about AI, while banks cited tangible efficiency gains from integrating it in their operations. “We’re making the most of AI to speed up simplification and automation which is reducing manual activities,” Banco Santander SA Chief Executive Officer Hector Grisi said on the company’s earnings call. Dutch lender ING Groep NV has estimated that around 950 positions are at risk in the Netherlands by the end of 2026 in part due to the increased digitization in lending processes. Mentions of AI by consumer discretionary and energy companies followed closely, signaling rising adoption in personalization, automation and risk management. Alongside this, management sentiment has risen sharply — now nearing post-2021 highs as executives shake off lingering macroeconomic uncertainty — fueling optimism about 2026. That, in turn, is boosting consensus, with Deutsche Bank’s Uleer urther earnings upgrades. And there could be more earnings outperformance to come in the fourth quarter, Uleer said. Profit expectations remain subdued, once again setting companies a relatively low bar to impress. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Comedian John Mulaney was among the politicians and reporters you might expect to see attending oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday. ""Cheap seats but a great show,"" the 43-year-old stand-up comic wrote in an X post, sharing a crudely drawn map showing his seat behind high-profile figures such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Ed Markey and Meta’s president of global affairs Joel Kaplan. Mulaney is collaborating with Neal Katyal — the lawyer arguing the case on behalf of the plaintiffs — on a new TV series. Katyal described the show as a ""kind of ‘West Wing' for the Supreme Court"" while speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival earlier this year. The case itself relates to President Donald Trump’s ability to impose sweeping tariffs on other nations. TRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER' At issue before the court is whether the president can use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose two broad sets of tariffs on most countries — including a 10% global tariff Trump announced in April and the higher so-called reciprocal tariffs imposed on nearly 50 countries. Trump said at the time that trade deficits amounted to ""the precipice of an economic and national security crisis"" sufficient to trigger his powers under IEEPA. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER The justices spent little of their questioning Wednesday on the economic impacts of Trump’s tariff plans. Instead, most of the oral arguments focused on the IEEPA statute at the heart of the case, its applicability to tariffs or taxation powers — and what guardrails, if any, exist to limit an executive’s authority should the high court rule in Trump’s favor. JOHN MULANEY SPOOFS AWKWARD BILL BELICHICK INTERVIEW TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY FACES CRUCIAL TESTS AS SUPREME COURT BEGINS PIVOTAL TERM While Trump wrote on Truth Social this week that the case is ""literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our country,"" Katyal argued that Trump had ""torn up the entire tariff architecture."" The plaintiffs in the case contend that in the 50 years since its passage, the IEEPA has never been used by a president to impose tariffs and that permitting the president to do so would drastically expand his powers at the expense of other branches of government. Earlier this year at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Katyal discussed his collaboration with Mulaney, saying the ""law is not particularly good at creating social change"" and that art can help reach people in different ways.

"Canada's retail sales slow to weakest pace in more than a year Latest data will do little to move needle on Bank of Canada decision Canadian consumer spending slowed in the third quarter as a painful trade war with the United States persisted and population growth continued to wind down. Retail sales grew 0.2 per cent between July and September after rising 0.3 per cent in the previous quarter, according to Statistics Canada data Friday. September sales fell 0.7 per cent, matching the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists, while a flash estimate suggested October sales were flat. The quarterly retail figures — the weakest pace in more than a year — underscore consumer caution around spending in the face of economic and tariff uncertainty. They also likely reflect federal immigration curbs that have slowed Canada’s once-explosive population gains to a crawl. The Bank of Canada plans to move to the sidelines after cutting its benchmark overnight rate to 2.25 per cent, saying rates are at “about the right level” if the economy and inflation evolve as it expects. The central bank foresees household consumption slowing due to the immigration changes and a soft labor market. In volume terms, retail sales fell 0.3 per cent on the quarter and dropped 0.8 per cent in September. Overall, sales were down in six of nine subsectors that month, led by autos, a volatile category this year amid US tariffs. Bank of Canada surveys have shown Canadians expect the levies to cause vehicle prices to surge. Motor vehicle sales fell 2.9 per cent in September, the first decline in three months and led by lower receipts at new car dealers. Still, auto purchases were still up 7.4 per cent in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period last year, likely reflecting a rush by some consumers to get ahead of the tariff impacts. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.2 per cent on the month, beating economists’ expectations for a 0.5 per cent decline. This suggests underlying consumer spending is holding up, Charles St-Arnaud, chief economist at Alberta Central, said in an email. Still, he said the quarterly slowdown suggests consumer spending only contributed marginally to gross domestic product growth in the third quarter, which likely rose a meagre 0.4 per cent on an annualized basis. Statistics Canada reports those figures Nov. 28. “Whether the labour market continues to be resilient remains key for the economic outlook,” he said. Core retail sales, which exclude gas stations and car dealers, were relatively unchanged in September. The largest decrease to core retail sales came from building material and garden equipment dealers, which fell 2 per cent and recorded a third monthly drop, while sales also dipped at general merchandise stores. The largest increase to core retail sales came from food and beverage retailers, which rose 0.8 per cent and were led by growth at beer, wine and liquor retailers, followed by supermarkets and grocery stores. In September, sales declined in six of 10 provinces. The largest provincial decrease in dollar terms was seen in Ontario, the country’s manufacturing heartland, which dropped 1.2 per cent while sales in Toronto were down 2.3 per cent. British Columbia saw a decline of 0.9 per cent, with a 1 per cent drop in Vancouver. The statistics agency didn’t provide details for the October estimate, which is based on responses from 54.2 per cent of companies surveyed. “Canadian retail sales continue a holding pattern as support from lower interest rates faces headwinds from trade uncertainty,” Shelly Kaushik, senior economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a report to investors. “The bigger picture is one of mild economic growth that will do little to move the needle for the Bank of Canada heading into its December meeting.” — With assistance from Mario Baker Ramirez and Erik Hertzberg.

"The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case centered on President Donald Trump’s use of an emergency law to enact his sweeping ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, and even Trump-appointed justices appeared skeptical of the administration’s arguments. Several questions from conservative justices, particularly Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, suggested uncertainty about allowing Trump to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact his steep 10% tariffs on most imports. A ruling against the administration would deliver a major blow to Trump's signature economic policy. The IEEPA law gives the president broad economic powers in the event of a national emergency tied to foreign threats, and Trump declared the trade deficit such an emergency to impose tariffs via executive order earlier this year. But the law does not mention the word ""tariffs"" or ""taxes"" — a major sticking point in both this week’s oral arguments and the lower court’s earlier review of the case. Most of the justices’ questions focused on a single phrase in the law — the power to ""regulate importation"" during a national emergency — and whether that phrase grants Trump the authority he claims. Several justices seemed wary of a reading that could hand Congress’ Article I power over revenue and taxation to the executive branch. SUPREME COURT TO WEIGH TRUMP TARIFF POWERS IN BLOCKBUSTER CASE This included Trump’s appointees, who appeared to struggle with separation-of-powers issues that could vastly expand presidential authority — not only for Trump but for his successors as well. Barrett, in particular, pressed U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer on this, asking: ""Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase — together with ‘regulate importation’ — has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?"" Gorsuch later asked Sauer about his ""theory of the Constitution"" and ""major questions doctrine,"" indicating concern about separation-of-powers issues and granting too much power to the executive. TRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER' ""What would prohibit Congress from abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce or declare war to the president?"" Gorsuch asked Sauer. Sauer repeatedly argued that a ""regulatory tariff"" is not a tax and that the power to raise revenue was ""only incidental,"" even as the White House has celebrated that Trump's tariff revenues exceeded $100 billion this year. Challengers, including private entities and Democratic-led states, argue that Congress must clearly state when it wants presidents to have the authority to implement tariffs. In court filings, they pointed to laws such as Section 232 (national security trade measures) and Section 301 (retaliation for unfair trade) as times when Congress expressly gave tariff powers to the president. By contrast, IEEPA has been used for embargoes, asset freezes and licensing but never across-the-board tariffs. The last time the Court permitted a delegation of tariff powers to the president, in Algonquin SNG v. FEA (1976), it relied on Section 232 because Congress put that authority plainly in the statute. Challengers say there is no comparable language in IEEPA. The liberal justices on the Court signaled that without clear words from Congress, IEEPA cannot provide Trump with tariff authority. After a previous Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024), courts no longer give federal agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting vague laws. And under the ""major questions"" doctrine referred to by Gorsuch and other justices, large, economy-wide actions like Trump's tariffs need a plain, specific grant from Congress. JONATHAN TURLEY: SUPREME COURT RULING ON TRUMP TARIFFS COMES DOWN TO A NUMBERS GAME Court watchers and legal experts said after arguments that a Trump administration win could be more difficult than expected, though each cautioned it is hard to draw conclusions from roughly two hours of oral arguments — a fraction of the total time justices spend reviewing a case. Jonathan Turley, a law professor and Fox News contributor, said in a blog post that the justices ""were skeptical and uncomfortable with the claim of authority, and the odds still favored the challengers."" ""However, there is a real chance of a fractured decision that could still produce an effective win for the administration,"" Turley added. SUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY Jack Goldsmith, a former assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, did not go quite as far. ""I think that it is fair to say that the justices the government needs to win the case — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — asked the government very hard questions that did express skepticism about important elements of its case,"" Goldsmith said in a New York Times interview. ""But they also asked the other side very hard questions. I do not think any of these three tipped off their hands definitively. I did not find anything terribly surprising in the questions."" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the CATO Institute, told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement that members of the Court seemed uncomfortable with expanding presidential power over tariffs. ""Most justices appeared attentive to the risks of deferring to a president's interpretation of an ambiguous statute and the executive branch ‘discovering’ new powers in old statutes,"" Skorup said. ""The justices were skeptical and uncomfortable with the claim of authority, and the odds still favored the challengers. However, there is a real chance of a fractured decision that could still produce an effective win for the administration."" The case is Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump (consolidated with Trump v. V.O.S. Selections). A ruling is expected by late June.",right
"The watershed moment came in July when the federal government became the largest shareholder of MP Materials, a California miner of rare earth elements for the oft-overlooked but critical magnets that help connect the global economy. The government’s unusual foray into private industry was accompanied by new rules setting minimum U.S. market prices for some of these materials—a pricing floor it said was necessary to protect MP Materials from Chinese competitors it accused of “dumping” their goods at artificially low prices. It marked the start of a campaign by the Trump administration to overturn China’s 30-year dominance of trade in many critical minerals that are increasingly integral to the products—from drones and automobiles to data centers and missiles—that drive America’s economy and help bolster its national security. “This is really a Manhattan Project-style effort with all-out intensity,” MP Materials CEO James Litinsky told Fortune. MP is expanding its Mountain Pass mining, refining, and recycling in California and its new Texas magnet plant in this “Cold War 2.0.” At issue are 60 natural elements deemed “critical minerals” by the U.S. government, including the 17 so-called rare earths as well as key materials used in batteries. America has zero production of over half of them. If it’s been a while since you studied the periodic table, rare earths are elements that share silvery-white soft heavy metal characteristics. While none are household names on their own, they are key ingredients in the amenities of modern life. Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets are used in virtually anything that moves. The “core four” rare earths for the magnets, motors, turbines, and more are neodymium and praseodymium, as well as the rarer dysprosium and terbium, which make magnets more heat resistant. The oxymoron of rare earths is they’re abundant, but they’re difficult to produce because of the challenges extracting, separating, and refining them in large quantities. They’re harder to find in large concentrations, and the infrastructure and technical know-how to refine them are exceedingly difficult to build from scratch without being undermined by China’s subsidized cost advantages. China mines the vast majority of rare earths and many of the critical minerals, but its strongest chokehold is the refining, where China dominates with a 90% global market share, including 99% for some. It is China’s threatened export controls on dysprosium, terbium, and magnets causing the most concern among U.S. policymakers and businesses. Even with the government-backed race to build up domestic mining and refining facilities, the U.S. can’t go it alone. The country is hurrying to ink international partnerships to circumvent the China-controlled supply chains. Emerging recycling industries and magnet chemistry alternatives are required as well. “The Trump administration is leaving no tool off the table to safeguard our national and economic security,” the White House told Fortune. The new effort is palpable, but it doesn’t erase decades of Chinese superiority and a lack of planning before a tariff war was launched—even now that a temporary truce was struck. What’s next? The industry consensus is that—with a concerted effort—the U.S. and allies can make a serious dent in Chinese control in less than five years. But it requires at least a decade to eliminate global reliance on China. In three years, the U.S. capacity of magnet production could meet a small majority of domestic needs, according to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie. But bottlenecks in rare earths refining may still slow production for years. Jeff Dickerson, principal advisor for Rystad Energy research firm, fears investors and foreign friends are wary of the U.S. commitment required to see it through. “Attention spans are fickle, and I worry that today’s focus on solving challenges will dissipate,” Dickerson said. “We’re stuck trying to dig our way out of a hole without a discernable plan, limited tools to act quickly, and allies who are skeptical of our reliability.” As it stands now, global demand for magnets made from rare earths is expected to surge 25% over the next five years and then keep growing. Federal financial support is increasingly flowing as more companies develop U.S. mines, refining facilities, and magnet plants. The Trump administration, operating as an unofficial sovereign wealth fund with support flowing from various financial sources, recently took shareholder stakes in Canada’s Lithium Americas and its Thacker Pass mining project in Nevada, and in Trilogy Metals and its Alaska minerals projects. The U.S. also inked a landmark deal with Australia to increase access to rare earths and other critical minerals. And President Trump recently made several agreements in Asia. Elsewhere, Ramaco Resource’s aims to extract rare earths from its Brook coal mine in Wyoming. Energy Fuels added rare earths processing to its uranium plant in Utah and is planning mines internationally. USA Rare Earth plans to mine for rare earths in West Texas and produce magnets in Oklahoma. On the refining and magnets side, Noveon is producing magnets in Texas and recycling them with goals to expand, and e-VAC Magnetics is opening a plant in South Carolina. Canada’s Ucore Rare Metals recently broke ground on a processing plant in Louisiana. The U.K.’s Pensana just scrapped plans for a rare earths refinery in England to develop one in the U.S. And the industry leader, Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths, wants to build a Texas processing plant but is still seeking more U.S. government support. A bevy of domestic projects are underway, but not all will come to fruition. Refiner Phoenix Tailings just opened its first plant in New Hampshire with major expansions planned. “This is our Sputnik moment where the U.S. finally woke up and saw that someone else is just killing us in this race,” said CEO Nick Myers. Leader in the clubhouse A decade ago, California’s Mountain Pass mine was failing because of heavy indebtedness and China’s price dumping into the global rare earths market. A hedge fund manager who’d bought into the bonds during the bankruptcy proceedings, Litinsky formed MP Materials and acquired the Mountain Pass assets in 2017. Since then, MP has steadily built up its capabilities, including opening the—not one to miss a marketing opportunity—”Independence” magnet plant in Fort Worth, Texas. Litinsky didn’t predict the AI boom, but he foresaw the rapidly growing need for magnets and all facets of the supply chain. “You can have all the rare earths in the world but, if you don’t have magnet-making capability, you’re still sending them to China. You really need all pieces of this puzzle to solve the problem,” he said. “Multibillion-dollar supply chains don’t move overnight, and it was very clear that this would take a long time. We’ve done it thoughtfully in stages.” Because of MP’s ownership of the only U.S. mine dedicated to rare earths and its growing vertical integration of magnet production, the U.S. Department of Defense bought a 15% stake in the company this summer for $400 million, sending its market cap soaring. MP and Apple quickly announced a $500 million partnership to supply magnets fully manufactured from recycled materials, a pledge that entails recycling expansions at both the Mountain Pass and Fort Worth facilities. The deal with the government gives MP confidence to progress with expansions because China’s price-dumping threats are largely removed courtesy of the floor-pricing mechanism. “They took the things off the table that we needed to warp-speed our investment,” Litinsky said. “That’s actually quite unique.” The race to build NioCorp Developments aims to start construction next year on the big Elk Creek critical minerals and rare earths mine in Nebraska. In the meantime, the company awaits a decision on a pending $780 million loan from the Export-Import Bank and hopes to strike a floor-pricing deal with the government. “The needs are immediate. We’re going to have to bite the bullet, and we’re going to have to build these facilities,” NioCorp CEO Mark Smith told Fortune. “With that wake-up message that China sent us, the markets opened up, and now we’re going to be able to address onshoring of these supply chains.” There’s no doubt that NioCorp and others are angling for similar deals to what MP struck with the federal government, even if it’s just an arrangement on pricing. But it’s also clear not everyone will succeed in scoring such agreements. “When I go to D.C., I make sure I call that [MP deal] a precedent, and nobody argues,” Smith said. “I’m a true-blue American. When it first came out, I was extremely happy. On the other hand, I like our democratic and capitalist society, and government price supports don’t feel very good. But, when you realize what it’s going to do to stop that vicious Chinese MO they’ve undertaken for 30 or 40 years, it’s really positive.” The same applies to international projects, especially in territories Trump says he wants to annex. Critical Metals CEO Tony Sage is developing the massive Tanbreez rare earths mine in Greenland and recently received a letter of intent for a $120 million Ex-Im Bank loan. Sage wants to work with the U.S. to supply the desired heavy rare earths, such as terbium. “In the 19th century, there was the gold boom. The 20th century was the oil boom,” Sage said. “We’re in the rare earths boom now, but this boom is going to fund everything for the next 30 to 50 years. Everything in your life needs rare earths.” Many of the proposals are from young companies without vertical integration. That may make it harder for them to ink enough offtake contracts to reach final investment decisions and commence construction, Rystad’s Dickerson said. “This all screams risk to financiers who also have the experience of volatile commodity price cycles in most mineral commodity markets over the past 30 years.” A possible exception is uranium mining leader Energy Fuels, the third-largest, publicly traded rare earths miner and refiner after Lynas and MP. When uranium markets struggled a few years ago, Energy Fuels started processing rare earths at its White Mesa Mill in Utah. Now, Energy Fuels aims to develop critical minerals mines in Australia and Madagascar. Too many domestic mining projects lack the necessary mineral quality and economics, Energy Fuels CEO Mark Chalmers said. It will take the combination of domestic refining and magnets production coupled with more international mining and separating partnerships for the U.S. to win in the long run, he said. “You need these next five years to really get that pendulum to swing in the right direction in a material way,” Chalmers said. And it may not hurt that Energy Fuel’s Australia mining development is the Donald Project—named after a minerals deposit, not President Trump. “We’ve had a few smiles and chuckles out of that,” he added with a laugh. Recycling and other alternatives One way to avoid the challenges of mining and refining rare earths is to simply not use them. Minnesota’s Niron Magnetics is one of the players pursuing alternate paths, recently breaking ground on its first plant with magnets made from iron nitride—utilizing iron from domestic steelmaking and nitrogen from the fertilizer industry. “We will need to triple the number of magnets in the world,” said Niron CEO Jonathan Rowntree. “There are only enough rare earths for that to double from what’s being actively mined right now and new mines that are opening. This was always going to be a problem.” The technology took well over a decade to develop, and Niron is still working to further advance the strength of the magnets. But the company already has a partnership with major automaker Stellantis for motor development. “We were born and raised to compete with China, but we’re playing a different game where there’s no chokehold on the raw material supply or equipment to make our product,” Rowntree said. The other key approach to upsetting the critical minerals supply chains is recycling. In the U.S., Tesla cofounder and Redwood Materials CEO JB Straubel leads the industry in battery recycling in Nevada and a brand-new, $3.5 billion plant in South Carolina. The goal is to take old batteries from EVs and other equipment to essentially mine them for their core critical minerals—lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper. The end goal is creating a circular economy where recycling—not mining—becomes the primary source of the minerals. “It’s kind of obvious, but not very intuitive, that almost all of the raw materials inside of batteries are reusable,” Straubel told Fortune. “As EVs and other energy storage products proliferate in the market, we have this incredible opportunity to evolve toward this materials economy for those products that will be 98% or 99% remanufactured over time.” The end result is Redwood already is the nation’s unofficial leading “miner” of cobalt through its recycling efforts, and near the top in lithium and nickel. MP Materials, for instance, plans to take the same recycling route with magnets and rare earths. In magnet manufacturing, more than 20% of the materials are lost during the process and can be recycled, Litinsky said. It will take all of these efforts combined to break China’s monopolistic practices and prevent China from rebuilding its dominance, he said. “Regardless of which way this goes, Humpty Dumpty is not getting put back together again,” Litinsky said. “Clearly, supply chains are changing no matter what happens.” A version of this article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “How rare earths became ground zero in the U.S.-China rivalry.”",right
"Tuesday on CNN’s “The Source,” Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) said last week’s election results showed people were “not buying” what President Donald Trump is selling. Host Kaitlan Collins said, “Do people in your state who are paying more at the grocery store, do they believe that higher grocery prices, higher utility costs are a con job?” Moore said, “The president thinks we’re stupid. The president is telling us to believe our lying eyes. I mean, Kaitlin, think about it, I mean, just this past weekend, I went shopping with my daughter, and we bought fruit. We bought bread. We she wanted some whipped cream. I bought some coffee, some basic items, and it was over $100. That is not a con job. That is the fact that we are watching grocery prices continue to explode. It’s the fact that people are watching their energy prices have jumped over 20% since the President of the United States went back into that office.” He added, “It’s the fact that we’re watching everything from the food that we are eating to the clothes that we are wearing, to the fact that the average new car price now is over $50,000, that that is not a con job. So the president knows that his policies, his tariff policies that have made things more expensive, that they are not popular. So what does he then do? He just tries to change the conversation and make people focus on something else and make other people to blame for it. But he campaigned on this. He has not gotten it done. I think the election results that we saw last week are direct reflection of the fact that the people are not buying what he is selling.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Beef prices have been giving Americans sticker shock at grocery stores lately, and they are poised to reach even more stomach-churning levels next year, according to Omaha Steaks CEO Nate Rempe. In an interview Friday on Fox Business’ Mornings with Maria, he pointed out that the U.S. cattle herd is at 70-year lows while beef demand is at all-time highs. To rebuild herds, ranchers must hold on to heifers rather than sending them out to meat processors. There are signs of that happening, but that also means beef supply will shrink in the near term, Rempe warned. “So we are headed for what I’m calling the $10-a-pound reality by third quarter of ’26,” he predicted. “Families are going to see $10-a-pound ground beef in the grocery store.” According to the latest consumer price index data, the average price of ground beef was $6.323 a pound in September. That’s up 14% since January and 26% from January 2024. If ground beef hits $10 a pound, the price would represent a 58% surge from September’s level. Anger about worsening affordability delivered stunning losses to Republicans during off-year elections this month. On Friday, Trump announced that he’s scrapping tariffs on beef, coffee, and a range of other commodities. But non-tariff factors are driving beef’s price spike. Droughts, high interest rates, and expensive feed have combined to shrink the U.S. cattle herd sharply. At the same time, demand for protein is also soaring and is even showing up in Starbucks lattes. Wesley Batista, who shares control of the $15 billion meat-packing behemoth JBS, said last month the U.S. needs to import more product from abroad to meet its insatiable demand. That includes supply from Brazil and Argentina. While Trump eased tariffs on Argentine beef, Rempe pointed out the country accounts for just 2% of U.S. beef supply, meaning the solution to higher prices will depend on domestic producers. But Trump has also targeted meat producers, accusing them of “driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.” “I am asking the DOJ to act expeditiously,” Trump posted last week on social media. “Action must be taken immediately to protect Consumers, combat Illegal Monopolies, and ensure these Corporations are not criminally profiting at the expense of the American People.” Meanwhile, Rempe vowed not to raise prices on Omaha Steaks’ primary gift packages, saying the company can leverage inventory stockpiles, vertical integration, and technology like AI, automation and robotics. He also suggested consumers buy ground beef that’s 80% meat and 20% fat because it represents a better cost per ounce from a yield perspective. Still, if shoppers see ground beef at the market with price tags that read $10.00 per pound, it will cross a major psychological threshold. “It’s going to be tough on families,” Rempe said. “I mean that’s going to be quite a shock when that price point hits the four digits. It really feels like it has increased dramatically.”",right
"World economy shows surprising tariff resilience, OECD says It continues to predict global growth will slow to 2.9% in 2026 from 3.2% in 2025 The global economy is weathering Donald Trump’s trade tariffs better than expected as activity gets a boost from strong investment in artificial intelligence and supportive fiscal and monetary policies, the OECD said. The Paris-based organization raised its U.S. and euro-area growth forecasts for this year and next, and made small upward adjustments for other major economies in its latest outlook. Still, it continues to predict global growth will slow to 2.9 per cent in 2026 from 3.2 per cent in 2025 as the full effects of levies on trade have yet to be felt. “The global economy has been resilient this year, despite concerns about a sharper slowdown in the wake of higher trade barriers and significant uncertainty,” Secretary General Mathias Cormann said. “Yet, global trade growth moderated in the second quarter of this year, and we expect higher tariffs to gradually feed through to higher prices, reducing growth in household consumption and business investment.” Disruption from Trump’s efforts to rewrite the rules of world commerce has been hard to predict for international organizations and economists. In June, the OECD warned U.S. growth would slow to 1.6 per cent this year, only to raise that to 1.8 per cent in September and to now forecast two per cent. Surging AI investment and the construction of data centers, particularly in the U.S., are also having an increasing impact on economic estimates. According to the OECD, the buoyancy of the tech sector has underpinned global trade flows and production growth in the sector is out-pacing the rest of industry. The OECD estimates that without booming AI investments the US economy contracted by 0.1 per cent in the first half as household consumption growth moderated and government purchases fell. - Trump says U.S. plans to skip G20 Summit - Big investors scale back risky bond exposure - Advertisement 1Story continues below The organization cautioned that the rapid expansion in tech and optimism about AI poses a risk of abrupt price corrections and even forced asset sales given stretched valuations. Combined with concerns about swift changes in trade measures, the OECD said the outlook is “fragile” and its projections are “subject to substantial risks.” Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Jack Mintz: Maybe business leaders should end-run Ottawa on U.S. trade Big Swiss businesses negotiated a tariff deal after their government had failed. Maybe Canadian businesses should try to end the stalemate Last week, facing a downturn in GDP, Switzerland negotiated a deal with the Trump administration to lower is its eye-watering 39 per cent tariff to 15 per cent. How it got an agreement was unusual. After the Swiss government failed to get tariff relief, several big multinationals, including Rolex, Richemont and shipping company MSC, negotiated directly with U.S. President Donald Trump, seemingly with the government’s approval. As part of the agreement that emerged, the companies promise to invest US$200 billion in the U.S. There’s a lesson here for Canada. Our own negotiations with the United States are stalled — stuck, even. Although some experts counsel patience, Canada’s business sector can’t twiddle its thumbs waiting for a deal that could take two or three years. I’ve heard from many businesses that, as a simple matter of risk management, they’re realigning their supply chains with new or expanded facilities in the U.S. Their presumption is that tariffs will be here for years, even if at a lower baseline rate. But even if tariffs disappeared tomorrow, producing in the U.S. reduces risk. In the first half of 2025, the U.S. was the major recipient — by far — of foreign direct investment, attracting 45 per cent of total OECD inflows. Monday evening I attended the annual AmCham Thanksgiving dinner with guest speakers Pete Hoekstra, U.S. ambassador to Canada, and Kirsten Hillman, our ambassador to the U.S. It was surreal: each extolled the virtues of the Canada-U.S. partnership. Neither mentioned the elephant in the room: Trump tariffs. Hillman did refer to the stalled negotiations, which she predicted will come back on track. Hoekstra said little but dropped by many tables to greet attendees. He told ours and maybe others that Canada needs to get back to negotiations. Three reasons are usually given for strategic patience on our part. - You can’t build a nation by targeting favoured industries - An investment banker’s dream budget - Advertisement 1Story continues below The first is that because of CUSMA we face a relatively low effective tariff — 5.4 per cent according to the federal budget, though that’s triple what it was last year. With CUSMA up for review in 2026, why negotiate now? Why? You’ve got to be kidding: Because important economic sectors are being hammered today. Non-CUSMA-exempt autos and parts are paying 25 per cent; steel, aluminum and semi-finished copper, 50 per cent; lumber and energy, 10 per cent; finished wood products, 25 per cent; and non-CUSMA exempt goods, 35 per cent. And Congress has eliminated the tariff exemption for packages costing less than US$800 (though a personal exemption of US$200 still applies). Businesses tell me border costs are way up, with all products being examined to determine the tariff rate. The second usual argument for delay is that the U.S. Supreme Court may soon quash tariffs related to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. That is worth waiting for but it only involves the “fentanyl tariffs” — the 35 per cent general tariff on non-CUSMA products and the 10 per cent on energy. The sector-specific tariffs that are not so slowly bleeding Canadian manufacturing exports would remain. And besides, new tariffs can be introduced under other legislation. For now, the effects are clear: Stellantis has suspended electric jeep production. GM has halted electric van production and Ford has cancelled EV plans, although it will expand some internal combustion engine production in Canada. Nutrien just announced a new potash export terminal for the U.S. rather than Canada. The third common argument for strategic patience is that Trump will have to back off as his political support wanes. Despite strong investment, including for AI, the U.S. economy is slowing down and cost-of-living pressures continue. Trump is already focusing on affordability, including by giving US$2,000 of tariff revenue to low- and middle-income taxpayers. Will tariffs be reversed? As I have argued before, Trumpians like tariffs for three reasons: to build up the manufacturing sector for economic and national security reasons, to pressure other countries to open their markets to U.S. exports, and to raise revenues. These arguments will still have traction even after Trump’s time in the White House is over, in 2029. Any future administration will be reluctant to give up what may be US$200-$300 billion in revenues, given America’s chronic fiscal deficit. Moreover, most Americans, including Democrats, don’t like free trade. National security “trumps” it, as you might say. Canada’s governments are no different. Ontario’s recent economic statement gives Ontario businesses preference in procurement of equipment and raw materials. So much for removing inter-provincial barriers to trade. No business operating in today’s landscape can wait as Canadian and American negotiators dawdle for several more years. Maybe Canada’s business community should take a leaf from the Swiss playbook and apply direct pressure to get tariffs down to the 10 per cent baseline as soon as possible. If that means visiting the White House, so be it. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion. Please keep comments relevant and respectful.

"In October, President Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a phone conversation where both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepen what they described as a “special and privileged strategic partnership.” The call highlighted the continuity of bilateral cooperation between the two nations across trade, energy, and defense sectors. India has maintained its position of strategic autonomy, balancing relations with both the West and Moscow. Despite Western pressure, India previously resisted calls by former US President Donald Trump to halt purchases of Russian oil. The US had imposed a 50% tariff on Indian exports, citing the need to increase pressure on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine. Trump said this week that Washington and New Delhi were “pretty close” to a trade deal that could reduce the tariff, also noting a decline in India’s Russian oil imports compared to earlier levels. Putin and Modi last met in September during a summit in China’s port city of Tianjin, hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The three leaders — Xi, Modi, and Putin — were seen conversing and sharing a light moment on the sidelines of the event, signaling continued engagement among key Eurasian powers. Putin’s upcoming visit will mark his first trip to India since the start of the war in Ukraine and is expected to include discussions on trade, energy cooperation, and geopolitical coordination amid shifting global dynamics.

"WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI: Indian spice merchants and tea growers will be among global exporters who will breathe easy along with American consumers after US president Donald Trump, feeling the heat of rising domestic prices due to tariffs, moved to lower import duties on nearly 200 food, farm, and agricultural items. Tucked deep in the list is a range of spices, including black pepper, cloves, cumin, cardamom, turmeric, ginger, varieties of tea, mango derivatives, and some nuts, including cashew, all of which India exports to the US.

As Americans go bananas over tariffs, Trump smells the coffee, eases import duties; relief for Indian tea and spices Trump's duty waiver gives major boost to India's key agri exports Indian spice exports to the US were valued at more than $500 million in 2024, and the US imported tea and coffee from India worth nearly $83 million in the same period. The US also imported $843 million worth of fresh or dried cashew nuts - which also got a break - from across the world, with India accounting for around 20% of the imports. Not making the cut, however, are Indian seafoods, including shrimp, and basmati rice, which are multi-billion dollar exports from India to the US. Indian gems, jewellery, and apparel, too, remain under 50% US tariff sanctions, pending a trade deal that Trump has said will happen once New Delhi turns off the Russian oil spigot and steps up buying US energy. Effectively, the exemptions apply only to little over $1 billion in qualifying agricultural exports from India. Indian govt officials said in New Delhi that 50 processed food products, whose exports were estimated at $491 million last year, including coffee and tea extracts, cocoa preparations, juices, fruit pulps, mango-based products and vegetable waxes, will be the top gainers. Next will be spices, whose exports were pegged at $359 million last year. They said that 48 fruits and nuts, such as coconuts, guavas, mangoes, cashew nuts, bananas, areca nuts, and pineapples, also stand to benefit although the value of these exports was around $55 million. This amounts to nearly a fifth of India's agricultural exports, estimated at $5.7 billion. Exempted products were estimated at around 40% of India's goods exports of $86 billion last year.

"U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stepped directly into the center of European policymaking on Monday, pressing EU leaders to ease what Washington views as an increasingly punitive regulatory regime targeting American technology firms. On his first official trip to Brussels since the July trade agreement, Lutnick made the administration’s position explicit: any movement on steel and aluminum tariffs—an urgent priority for Europe’s manufacturers—will depend on reforms to the bloc’s digital-regulatory framework and resolution of multibillion-euro cases against U.S. tech companies. “Our suggestion is that the European Union and their trade ministers deeply consider trying to analyse their digital rules, try to come away with a balance,” Lutnick said at a joint appearance with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic. A person familiar with the discussions said Lutnick told European officials that the bloc’s regulatory system has tilted heavily against American companies. A Trillion-Dollar Opening—If Europe Changes Course Lutnick argued that scaling back the EU’s “regulatory chokehold” on U.S. firms could unlock massive investment. “If they take the foot off this regulatory framework and make it more inviting for our companies, they can get the benefit of hundreds of billions, possibly $1 trillion of investment,” Lutnick told Bloomberg Television. He added that such a shift “would add a point and a half to European GDP,” according to AFP. The Commerce Secretary pointed specifically to ongoing antitrust actions against firms such as Google, which faces an EU penalty approaching €3 billion. “Let’s settle the outstanding cases,” Lutnick told Bloomberg. “Let’s put them behind us. Let’s come up with a reasonable framework where these companies can grow and build.” Washington: EU Digital Rules Target U.S. Firms The Trump administration has long contended that the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, and related competition rulings impose obligations structured in ways that overwhelmingly ensnare American companies. Greer noted that the EU’s thresholds “often include” criteria met only by U.S. firms, that compliance “can become challenging,” and that “fines can be quite large,” Bloomberg reported. He also pointed to what he described as “quite aggressive” enforcement. Lutnick directly linked U.S. tariff policy to the regulatory debate: “In exchange for that, we will come up with a cool steel and aluminum deal,” he told Bloomberg Television. Europe Under Pressure From Its Own Industry The issue has grown more acute for European manufacturers since the July trade deal set a fifteen percent baseline tariff on most EU goods. The administration has since widened its fifty percent metals tariffs to include products that contain steel and aluminum, not only the base materials. “Many machines that have been produced can’t be delivered to the U.S. and our companies are suffering from considerable declines in sales,” German Economy Minister Katherina Reiche told reporters, according to Bloomberg. EU officials pushed back. A European Commission spokesperson said the bloc maintains its “sovereign right to legislate,” AFP reported, while Sefcovic told Bloomberg the rules are “not discriminatory” and “not aimed at American companies.” Shared Concerns—But One Non-Negotiable U.S. Priority The meeting also addressed broader strategic issues, including Chinese overcapacity in steel and vulnerabilities in rare-earth and chip supply chains. “We didn’t only discuss bilateral issues, but also some of the challenges we are facing together: the overcapacity… China’s role in the global economy and other issues where we have to join forces,” said Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, according to AFP. But Lutnick’s core message remained unchanged: a stronger transatlantic partnership requires a fair regulatory environment for American technology companies. For European governments confronting sluggish growth and mounting frustration from their industrial sectors, the choice is now in plain view—maintain the current regulatory path or pursue the investment and economic expansion that Washington says could follow from a reset.

"A new study that examined 150 years of tariffs in the U.S. and abroad found they disrupt the economy and financial markets so much that the result is lower inflation. The conclusion goes against the conventional wisdom on how import taxes affect prices and comes as President Donald Trump’s tariffs have stirred a growing backlash among Americans who are angry about higher food, utility and insurance costs. But if the study’s finding are correct, Trump may eventually be able to point to better inflation numbers, assuming he can stomach a weaker economy and labor market. In a working paper published on Thursday, San Francisco Fed researchers Régis Barnichon and Aayush Singh said higher tariffs lead to reduced economic activity, higher unemployment and lower inflation in the short term. “The inflation response goes against the predictions of standard models, whereby CPI inflation should go up in response to higher tariffs,” they wrote. “Instead, tariff shocks appear to act as aggregate demand shocks—moving inflation and unemployment in the same directions.” One possible explanation is that tariffs create uncertainty that hits consumers’ and investors’ confidence, depressing economic activity and putting downward pressure on inflation, according to the study. Alternatively, tariffs could trigger a drop in asset prices that also weigh on demand, resulting in higher unemployment and lower inflation. “We find evidence in support of both channels: in response to higher tariffs, stock prices decline and stock market volatility increases,” Barnichon and Singh wrote. Before World War II, they found that a permanent 4-percentage-point increase in the tariff rate reduced inflation by 2 percentage points and raised unemployment by about 1 percentage point. After the war, the estimates are more uncertain but still point to tariff hikes reducing inflation and worsening unemployment, they added. Trump tariffs Administration officials have long maintained that Trump’s tariffs aren’t stoking inflation, even though the consumer price index has crept higher since he launched his trade war in April. But on Friday, Trump announced that he’s scrapping tariffs on beef, coffee, and a range of other commodities, after voter anger about worsening affordability delivered stunning losses to Republicans during off-year elections this month. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and other policymakers believe tariffs will likely produce a one-time boost to inflation, which eventually will resume its cooling trajectory. Despite fears of a recession, the economy has remained resilient amid Trump’s tariffs, though the recent government shutdown has put key indicators on hold. After dipping early this year, GDP rebounded strongly and consumer spending keeps expanding, largely on the backs of the wealthiest Americans. Similarly, stocks crashed after Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs but surged when he pulled back the most aggressive rates while the AI boom fueled tech shares. But employment has indeed slowed sharply with payrolls growing by just 22,000 in September. Trump’s immigration crackdown is also a factor in this low-hire, low-fire labor market. Still, even if inflation does head back down, that may not be good enough for voters, who are demanding that overall affordability improve and want to see prices decline, not just rise at a slower pace. “People are angry about the loss of affordability, and are inclined to blame incumbent governments for this,” Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note on Friday. “It is tempting to think of affordability as another version of the ‘cost of living crisis’—but affordability is subtly different, and may linger.”",right
"The budget results for the first month of the 2026 fiscal year were delayed by a 43-day shutdown of many federal agencies, which caused delays of some payments, such as for salaries of government employees, a Treasury official said. The deficit last month was up $27 billion, or 10%, from the $257 billion deficit posted in October 2024, largely due to the shift of some $105 billion worth of November benefit outlays for some military and healthcare programs into October. Adjusting for these shifts, the October deficit would have been about $180 billion, a 29% reduction from an adjusted October 2024 deficit of $252 billion. Outlays for October, including the November benefit payments, totaled $689 billion, up 18% from the $584 billion in October 2024. The Treasury official said the department did not have a precise estimate of how much outlays were reduced by the shutdown-delayed payments from various agencies, but that the Treasury believed the reduction was less than 5% of total outlays. Federal law requires any unpaid salaries and other obligations during government shutdowns to be fully paid when funding is restored. Receipts for October totaled $404 billion, a record for the month and a 24% increase from the $327 billion collected in October 2024. TARIFF REVENUES HIT RECORD MONTHLY HIGH Net custom duties were among the biggest revenue drivers in October, reaching a new all-time monthly record of $31.4 billion because of new import tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump since he returned to the White House in January. This inflow beat the previous record of $29.7 billion in September and is more than four times the $7.3 billion recorded in October 2024. Trump said on Monday that tariff revenues would soon ""skyrocket"" to new records, arguing that businesses have largely depleted an inventory buildup of imported goods prior to his tariffs and would have to now import goods at higher rates. His comments on the Truth Social site appeared to be aimed partly at the U.S. Supreme Court, where justices earlier this month cast doubt on the legality of tariffs Trump imposed under an emergency law.""I look so much forward to the United States Supreme Court's decision on this urgent and time sensitive matter so that we can continue, in an uninterrupted manner to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" Trump wrote. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office said last week that recent tariff reductions brought about by U.S. trade deals with partner economies had caused the agency to cut its estimate for how much Trump's tariffs would reduce U.S. budget deficits over the next decade by 25% to $3 trillion, including interest costs, from the $4 trillion the agency projected in August. Also driving revenues higher was the $80 billion in non-withheld tax receipts for individuals received in October, which was an increase of $35 billion, or about 75%, from October 2024. The Treasury official said this increase largely reflected payments delayed by wildfires in California, where affected residents were allowed until October 15 to file and pay taxes. Withheld individual income tax receipts rose $16 billion, or 6%, from the year-ago period to $279 billion. But October corporate tax receipts were flat at $18 billion, and the Treasury official attributed the lack of growth to corporate tax breaks contained in the Republican-passed tax-cut and spending bill enacted this year. The U.S. Treasury's interest costs hit $104 billion in October, up $22 billion, or 27%, from October 2024, reflecting a higher debt load and slightly higher weighted average interest rate of 3.36%, the Treasury official said.",right
"How Tariffs Lower Inflation Without Hurting the Economy The San Francisco Federal Reserve’s paper on tariffs leaves us with a puzzle: why do tariffs affect the economy in such a counterintuitive way? Looking at 150 years of data, the researchers at the San Francisco Fed found that tariff hikes are followed by lower inflation and higher unemployment. That runs contrary to the widespread assumption that tariffs might result in higher levels of employment but at the cost of higher inflation. The authors of the paper say they think this might be a demand-destruction story: tariffs scare investors, tighten financial conditions, and reduce aggregate demand. They point to two possible channels: increased uncertainty about economic policy and declining asset prices. In either case, they think the result would be less investment and spending, resulting in fewer jobs and lower prices. It’s a plausible interpretation. But there’s another one that fits the San Francisco Fed’s results even better—and better explains the actual policy mix Trump is deploying. It starts with a simple observation: the American economy, particularly in tradable sectors, has spent decades locked into a low-wage, low-productivity equilibrium. But this is not the only—and certainly not the best—way to run the economy. (iStock/Getty Images)The Path Toward Low Wage, Low Productivity America With tariffs low and borders open, domestic firms faced a relentless downward pressure on price and costs. Foreign competitors offered rock-bottom costs. The easiest way to compete was obvious: keep wages down, skimp on capital investment, and hire lots of low-skill workers. Call it the low-wage equilibrium. Wages stay depressed. Productivity per worker stagnates. Employment is high in raw numbers, but the jobs are often unstable and poorly paid. This, in essence, is what “competing with China” meant in policy debates: we imported the low-wage production model directly into our own labor market. Now imagine what broad tariffs actually do to that setup. The Structural Shift Toward Higher American Productivity When you impose a general tariff increase—not a carve-out for one industry, but a comprehensive one—three things change simultaneously. First, foreign cost pressure eases. Domestic firms no longer need to match China’s price to survive. The brutal race to the bottom on wages becomes less binding. Second, workers’ bargaining power rises. Employers can no longer credibly threaten to source overseas. More importantly, the political act of raising tariffs sends a signal: the full faith and credit of the American people is backing domestic production. That shifts leverage in wage negotiations across the entire tradable sector and, because workers can move between sectors, spills into services as well. Third, cheap labor becomes relatively expensive compared to capital. With the wage floor rising and the supply of low-skilled workers finite, the “just hire more bodies” model stops making economic sense. The alternative path of investing in machines, reorganizing production, training workers, and deploying better logistics suddenly looks far more attractive. Add in the rest of the policy package—restricted low-skill immigration shrinking the inflow of wage-depressing workers, immediate expensing and lower taxes on capital, and pressure for lower interest rates—and the choice becomes obvious. Firms stop trying to run domestic sweatshops and start buying capital and raising productivity. In this supply-side interpretation, tariffs don’t primarily crush aggregate demand. They fundamentally change how we produce. Firms shift from many low-productivity workers with minimal capital and minimal wages to fewer workers with more capital per person, higher productivity, and higher wages. The implication is stark: some jobs disappear—specifically, the worst jobs at the bottom of the productivity ladder. The remaining jobs are more productive and better compensated. Output doesn’t collapse; it may even rise. But you need fewer workers once you’ve upgraded the capital stock and reorganized processes. This alone generates higher measured unemployment, even if total output is rising. Some of the low-skill, low-productivity jobs go away and some people get trapped in the transition. But this is likely a temporary phenomenon. As the economy shifts toward rewarding investing in higher productivity and domestic manufacturing, the workforce will shift along with it, bringing back in workers. So, the unemployment effect in the San Francisco Fed paper is exactly what you’d expect from a structural shift away from unproductive jobs, not from a generic demand collapse. Why Prices Fall Now comes the trickier part: squaring tariffs with disinflation. The standard objection is that tariffs raise costs and therefore should raise prices. Yet the San Francisco Fed finds the opposite over the long arc of history. How do we resolve this? The key is unit labor cost—the wage expense required to produce one unit of output. It’s a simple formula: wage per worker divided by output per worker. Tariffs combined with Trump-style policy push on both sides of that equation simultaneously. Wages rise because workers gain bargaining power inside the tariff wall and reduced low-skill immigration tightens the labor market from below. Productivity rises because firms respond to higher wage pressure and cheap capital by investing in machines, training, and software. Output per worker climbs. Here’s the critical insight: if productivity rises more than wages, unit labor costs actually fall. Even though workers earn more per hour, each unit of output becomes cheaper to produce. In competitive or semi-competitive markets, firms can’t sit on lower unit costs indefinitely. Those savings show up as either lower prices than the old models predict or much weaker pass-through of tariffs into consumer prices. That’s very likely why the San Francisco Fed finds disinflation rather than inflation after tariff hikes. You haven’t just destroyed demand. You’ve moved the entire supply side from low-productivity to high-productivity. Costs per unit are lower even though wages are higher. In short, the mechanism works like this: tariff shock plus fewer low-skill workers plus cheaper capital produces capital deepening and higher productivity, which lowers unit costs, which generates disinflation, not inflation. Two Stories, One Data Set This matters because both interpretations can fit the San Francisco Fed’s impulse responses. You can describe the same results in two languages: In the demand-destruction story, tariffs frighten investors, hurt confidence, and tighten credit. Households and firms cut spending. Lower demand produces higher unemployment and lower inflation. In the supply-side story, tariffs, immigration limits, capital tax cuts, and pressure for lower rates combine to make low-wage, low-productivity production uneconomical. Firms invest in capital and reorganize. Low-productivity jobs disappear while high-productivity jobs grow. The transition produces temporary unemployment, but the new supply side has higher real wages and lower unit costs. The question is which story better matches the policy mix we actually see and better accords with long-run outcomes. Trump’s program pairs tariffs with immigration restrictions, capital incentives, and monetary easing. The long-term political economy shows the country has shed bad jobs while raising real wages for workers who remain. On both counts, the supply-side story wins. That doesn’t mean every imaginable tariff is justified—we probably should not have tariffed coffee or bananas—or that current levels are optimal. Maybe tariffs should be set a bit higher given our still too-high level of inflation. It means the San Francisco Fed’s paper shouldn’t be read as evidence that tariffs work only by beating demand over the head. It should be read as evidence that tariffs, paired with immigration policy, capital policy, and monetary policy, are tools for breaking a low-wage equilibrium and pushing the economy toward more capital, more productivity, higher real wages, and a cooler price path.

"How Carney needs a new playbook to counter Trump in trade talks In the new global trade order, Canada must revolutionize its approach, not just raise fists for retaliation Mark Carney came to power in Canada by pitching himself as an economic crisis fighter who could fix the country’s ruptured relationship with the United States. Seven months after he won a national election, the economy is in a fragile state, and a trade truce with the Trump administration has been elusive. Much greater risks lie ahead for Carney, according to Barry Appleton, an international trade lawyer and dual U.S.-Canadian citizen who has given testimony to governments and agencies on both sides of the border, including the U.S. Trade Representative. Canadian industries including automotive and forestry are already under major pressure from U.S. tariffs. But President Donald Trump hasn’t even wielded what Appleton says is the nuclear trade option: threatening to withdraw from the Canada-U.S.-Mexico-Agreement that he signed during his first term and which comes up for review in 2026. Such a move would immediately thrust enormous U.S. leverage on its North American neighbours, Appleton argues. In Trump’s well-worn playbook, the White House would then make maximum demands of Canada, which sent about 75 per cent of its goods exports to the U.S. last year. Washington’s wish list includes opening up sectors such as dairy and banking, where Canada has long used regulations to restrict foreign goods and companies. “The Americans will ask for everything they possibly can because they’ve never had such a strong position that they’ve used,” he says. The Canadian side should be particularly worried about issues of digital sovereignty, he says, such as its ability to regulate digital payments, data and technology. That’s an area of trade on which the Trump administration has pushed back against the European Union. In the new global trade order, Canada needs to revolutionize its approach, Appleton argues. No longer is a weak currency and geographic proximity to the U.S. enough. The confrontation demands finesse and flexibility, not fists raised for retaliation like the early “Elbows Up” defiance campaigns from Carney and his predecessor, Justin Trudeau. “It requires smart strategy — real industrial policy and a foundational shift that it has not seen basically since the Second World War,” Appleton says. Here are excerpts from Bloomberg’s interview on Nov. 26 with Appleton. The exchange has been edited for length and clarity: Q: It has been a year since the famous social media post in which Trump threatened 25 per cent tariffs on everything from Canada and Mexico. What have we learned in the past year about the U.S. and trade? Appleton: I think the most important lesson right off of bat was, yes, he will do what he says he’s going to do, most of the time. But you’ve got to take it seriously all of the time. Donald Trump thinks very unconventionally about trade issues. That’s the most polite way I can put it. These are unusual policies compared to his predecessors. OK, get over it. Now you’ve got to figure out how you deal with that. Q: You have described this as not merely a trade matter, but as a matter of economic coercion. Explain what you mean by that. Appleton: Coercion is when you have unequal bargaining positions. Everybody knows — the Americans and the Canadians — that there must be a treaty. Canada must have a relationship with the United States because they can’t go back to WTO preferential tariff structures. It’s bad on both sides, but it’s especially bad for Canada. Any Canadian prime minister has a problem because at the end of the day, they have to make a deal. So the only question’s going to be, on what terms are those deals going to be? And the problem is that Prime Minister Carney, who is a very smart man, did a very bad negotiating thing — because he said to Canadians, I will only take the best deal. But the best deal happens to not be a very good deal. ‘Love’ and flattery Q: How do you expect this relationship or negotiation to play out in the months ahead? Appleton: In many respects, it’s up to the Canadians to decide how comfortable they are making the Americans, and particularly the president, feel exceptionally loved and comfortable. That’s the litmus test. How much love will Prime Minister Carney give to the president? UK Prime Minister Starmer understood he had to do this. And he put all the bells and whistles out and he may, as we look at this, end up with the best deal. Q: Do you think the White House will, to gain leverage, give a warning or threat that it’s going to pull out of USMCA? Appleton: I’d say they’re giving very serious consideration to that. Remember, the president doesn’t have to cancel the agreement. Simply hinting that he could, would put the Canadians in an incredibly difficult negotiating position. Q: And what would happen then, for Carney and the Canadian side? Appleton: Canadian public markets will have a significant crisis of confidence for sure. It will not be good for the [Canadian] dollar. It will be exceedingly painful for the Canadian industries that are already at risk — and those that know that they’re next in line. If I was in the banking sector, I wouldn’t be very happy, for example, because full-branch banking is going to be on that list. And the big issue that’s really going to be interesting is how we deal with not the old economy, the legacy economy, but how we deal with the new economy — the digital economy, the innovation economy. Digital finance Q: I’d like to hear from you about what you think the American demands will be from Canada on stablecoins, and the broader financial services sector and the banking sector. Appleton: The American ask on stablecoins is going to be really easy: Recognize what we do and don’t mess it up. Don’t add anything. We don’t want any Canadian prudential carve-outs or separate carve-outs [in regulation]. Q: And do you think the Canadian position will run contrary to that? Appleton: Yes, for sure. Canadians pride themselves on during the financial crisis that they had banks that were the most stable. And Mark Carney has it ingrained in his DNA. He foundationally believes that Canadian financial services regulations are inherently better than American ones. Q: Trump has complained that it’s too hard for U.S. banks to fully participate in the Canadian financial industry. [The major U.S. banks have operations in Canada that tend to focus on corporate lending, investment banking and wealth management. But for regulatory and capital reasons, they’ve been largely absent from retail financial services, which are dominated by domestic banks.] What will the ask be from the American side and what will the Canadian response be on access to the Canadian banking system? Appleton: Today, the answer to everything is going to be no. When the pressure’s applied, the answer to everything has to be yes. Here you have a situation where the president is in a position where he can apply tremendous pressure and when he applies that tremendous pressure, the number one ask will be for full branch banking. So that’s going to go down. There’s a large number of issues. Obviously an issue they’re going to start with is going to be dairy. The dairy issue is so politically sensitive, no government’s prepared to wear it. They’ll create a system under tariff-rate quotas or something to try to shield it. But for sure, that’s going to change. But they have to deal with issues for softwood, they’ve got to deal with issues for steel. They’re going to have to deal with issues on having much more common export control policy. These are things the Canadians aren’t going to be very happy about. Diversifying trade Q: Carney ordered a review of the previous government’s pledge to buy dozens of F-35 fighter jets, and it’s pretty clear that the F-35 decision is being held back as leverage. But is there any other leverage that Canada has? What you’ve painted here for the Canadian negotiating position is a pretty dark picture. Appleton: I’m not painting it. I’m merely reflecting it. There’s economic gravity that’s taking place here. We can keep telling everybody that it’s business as usual but it’s not. And the faster the Canadians understand that, the better, more accurate and more thoughtful their trade strategy is going to be. But this belief that it’s going to be ‘Elbows up’ and that’s going to be enough is just a recipe for disaster and for misery. Our problem is lack of investment, a lack of innovation, a lack of the capacity that would allow Canadians to sell higher-value goods — goods that would have moats around them. The prime minister’s strategy of going out and getting additional trading partners is something that we needed to do 20 years ago and 10 years ago and five years ago. And so it’s good that he’s doing it now. It’s just bad that we didn’t do that before. The things that are really important are going to be, will Canada stay firm on what the future is? Or will it lock itself into a colonialized system that’s going to come to the digital economy? Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Executives at General Motors (GM) are directing their parts suppliers to get out of China in yet another victory for President Donald Trump’s fierce tariff agenda. On Wednesday, sources close to GM told Reuters that the automaker is looking to move its auto parts supply chains out of China entirely: General Motors (GM.N), has directed several thousand of its suppliers to scrub their supply chains of parts from China, four people familiar with the matter said, reflecting automakers’ growing frustration over geopolitical disruptions to their operations. [Emphasis added] GM executives have been telling suppliers they should find alternatives to China for their raw materials and parts, with the goal of eventually moving their supply chains out of the country entirely, the people said. The automaker has set a 2027 deadline for some suppliers to dissolve their China sourcing ties, some of the sources said. [Emphasis added] In October, Trump announced 25 percent tariffs on medium and heavy-duty trucks and truck parts. The tariff on medium and heavy-duty truck parts applies to engines, transmissions, tires, and chassis, among other parts, administration officials said. Even as Trump has struck a deal with China to open its markets to some U.S. exporters, the administration continues levying tariffs on Chinese-made goods, as well as a 10 percent reciprocal tariff. GM’s decision to get its parts suppliers out of China comes as CEO Mary Barra said last year that despite continued quarterly losses in China, the automaker remained “committed” to the communist country’s auto market. Likewise, just in August, Barra defied Trump’s tariffs on China and planned to import Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) for its second-generation Chevrolet Bolt.

"Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand said Monday that Canada and India will move quickly to advance a trade deal after two years of strained relations, noting Ottawa has a new foreign policy in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war. Anand’s statement follows a meeting between Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Group of 20 summit in South Africa this past weekend, where the leaders agreed to restart stalled talks for a new trade deal. Relations between Canada and India have been strained since Canadian police accused New Delhi of playing a role in the June 2023 assassination of a Canadian Sikh activist near Vancouver. “The leaders were adamant that this work proceed as quickly as possible so that timing is going to be expeditious,” Anand said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Carney will visit India early next year. Anand noted Carney’s goal to double non-U.S. trade over the next decade. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and more than 75% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. Most exports to the U.S. are exempted by the USMCA trade agreement but that deal is up for review in 2026. “This is a completely new approach to foreign policy that is responsive to the global economic environment in which we find ourselves,” Anand said. “There is a new government, a new foreign policy, a new prime minister and a new world order where countries are becoming more protectionist and this is a moment for Canada as a trading nation.” Canada is also seeking better relations with Beijing. Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping took a step toward mending the long-fractured ties between their countries last month with a meeting at the Asia-Pacific summit. In 2023, Ottawa suspended trade talks after going public with allegations from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that the Indian government was behind an assassination of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Nijjar, 45, was fatally shot in his pickup truck after he left the Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland. Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Niijar’s murder and are awaiting trial in Canada. Relations improved in June when Carney invited Modi to the G7 summit in Alberta and when both countries agreed to restore their top diplomats in August. “This is a step by step process. And in the last six months, significant steps have been taken,” Anand said. Anand said both countries expect to be able to double bilateral trade by 2030, to US$50 billion, and noted that Canada is India’s seventh largest trade partner for goods and services, and one of the largest foreign investors in India. Trump ended trade talks with Carney after the Ontario provincial government ran an anti-tariff advertisement in the U.S., which upset him. That followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over the president’s insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. Anand said Canada remains ready to resume trade talks with Trump. “We are operating under the fact that the United States has fundamentally changed all of its trading relationships,” Anand said. “We look forward to getting back to the table.”",right
"President Donald Trump has spoken out on the U.S. affordability crisis, promising to both provide much-demanded relief to struggling Americans while simultaneously declaring the country has never been better. Trump spoke on Monday at the McDonald’s Impact Summit about the need for affordability and value, touting the fast-food chain for helping lower prices through its Extra Value Meals. He laid blame on stubborn inflation and high prices on President Joe Biden. “The Biden administration started the affordability crisis, and my administration is ending it,” Trump said in his address. “Affordable should be our word, not theirs,” he added. “Democrats get up and they talk about ‘affordability,’ ‘affordable.’ They don’t say that they had the worst inflation in history, the highest energy prices in history, everything was the worst.” At the same time, the president downplayed economic concerns, praising the strength of the country. “This is also the golden age of America, because we are doing better than we’ve ever done as a country,” Trump said. “Prices are coming down and all of that stuff.” K-shaped economy blues Trump’s pitch for affordability comes as polls indicate that his core supporters, working-class Americans, are questioning whether the administration has done enough to address the economy. Recent polling from CNN and NBC News, respectively, has indicated not only a bottoming out in the President’s approval rating, but also wavering confidence among Republicans regarding how he is handling the economy. The recent elections of New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and Seattle mayor-elect Katie Wilson—both young democratic socialists running on platforms of affordability—have some speculating whether voters are shifting blue again. All the while, there is growing evidence—and concern—about the K-shaped economy, or diverging fortunes for high-income and low-income Americans that resemble the two parting lines of the letter K. Inflation ticked up in September, according to the Department of Labor, likely a result of ongoing tariffs, while homeownership may not be affordable for another 10 to 15 years due to the reverberations from pandemic-era monetary policy that hiked interest rates, Amherst Group CEO Sean Dobson recently said. There are also growing disparities in wage growth between high- and low-income Americans, as well as an increase in both subprime and superprime loans, according to recent TransUnion data. Moody’s Analytics found last month that the top 10% of earners accounted for nearly half of second-quarter spending. At the same time, retail CEOs have noted in recent earnings reports that lower-income earners are pulling back. Even McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a CNBC Squawk Boxinterview in September that he has noticed a change in consumer behaviors, warning of a “two-tiered economy” of wealthier customers making up a growing chunk of the fast-food chain’s business. Addressing the affordability crisis Trump said in his hourlong address on Monday that he has made efforts to ease high prices for Americans, including slashing tariffs on groceries such as tomatoes and coffee, as well as beef, which has ballooned in price as cattle herd sizes dwindle. Last month, Trump floated buying beef from Argentina, which angered American cattle farmers, convinced the move would disrupt the free market they enjoy. The president has also promised Americans $2,000 tariff dividend checks, which he said could arrive mid-next year. “We worked on it this weekend,” Trump said on Monday. “And you’re going to see some of the items that were a little bit higher—they were lower than the last administration but a little bit higher—we’re going to have some little price reductions and, in some cases, some pretty good ones.” Economists have said American discontent will continue to increase so long as they perceive affordability as an issue, even if economic indicators improve. This is because consumer sentiment and the state of the economy are intertwined, according to Peter Atwater, an adjunct professor of economics at William & Mary and the president of Financial Insights, who popularized the term K-shaped economy. He said poor consumer sentiment will not only keep lower-income Americans from spending, but could also lead some to harbor anger that could drive workplace resentment, which could in turn drive down productivity. “At the bottom, this mindset develops where they recognize that they may never win, but that doesn’t mean, ‘I can’t help you lose,’” Atwater told Fortune. Atwater said souring consumer sentiment could also lead to political unrest, such as during the Arab Spring, when an increase in global food prices was linked to protests, according to a 2011 study from the New England Complex Systems Institute. “This is a crisis of confidence,” he concluded. “Sadly, those who are in the best position to address it seem at best indifferent, and that does not go unnoticed by those at the bottom.”",right
"The Reserve Bank has permitted exporters to bring proceeds of their shipments in 15 months as against the prevailing timeframe of 9 months in view of stress being faced by them.

"After 20 years spent building, fixing and scaling companies, I’ve learned the hardest thing to manufacture isn’t growth — it’s predictability. I’ve led a global logistics company through a turnaround that tripled revenue and ended in a successful acquisition by UPS. I’ve overseen the transformation of a construction equipment rental marketplace into a vertically integrated, AI-powered procurement platform that’s helping reshape how the massive jobsite economy runs. Across those experiences (and others), from private-equity boardrooms to field operations, the same thing has been true. The real arms race hasn’t been over artificial intelligence, interest rates or supply chains — it’s been over stability. For decades, executives have described turbulent markets with a simple acronym:VUCA — volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity. Today, VUCA is not a concept — it’s reality. Tariff shifts, supply chain shocks and labor shortages are now structural features of the global economy. In a high-volatility, low-growth world (U.S. GDP is projected to hover under 2%) leaders who win are the ones who can engineer predictability inside that chaos — building systems that perform, regardless of what the Fed or the market does next. Input Instability Regardless of sector or company size, 25-basis-point rate cuts typically don’t matter if the price of raw inputs swings wildly. That’s the situation construction firms have faced for years. Since 2020, input prices have risen nearly 40%. In just the first quarter of 2025 they climbed at a 9.7% annualized rate. Despite these jarring figures, contractors remain busy. However, margins are eroding. Fewer than 2% of contractors expect profit margins to increase in the next six months. This is the burden of unpredictability. Without stable input costs, even healthy pipelines are unstable under margin pressure. Rate cuts provide confidence at the edges — but predictability keeps projects profitable. Policy Volatility Then there are shocks imposed not by markets but by governments. Tariffs, subsidies and regulatory swings can change the rules of the game overnight. At a high level, more than half of U.S. companies report tariff-driven margin pressure. An analysis of more than 300,000 retail products found that prices were moderating after the pandemic, only to accelerate again once new tariffs took effect — underscoring how policy shocks, not interest rates, often drive pressure. This is unpredictability in its purest form: the rules of the game change mid-match. Recent data underscores how fragile the environment has become. Spending on factory manufacturing facilities development has fallen from its 2024 peak as companies pause projects amid tariff uncertainty and rising import costs. Even firms benefitting from reshoring incentives have alluded to delaying expansion until trade policy stabilizes. Rate cuts can ease financing costs, but they can’t stabilize an unstable policy environment. Workforce Uncertainty Finally, rate cuts don’t matter when there aren’t enough people to get the work done. That’s the bottleneck that businesses across industries are running into. To illustrate the point, across the U.S., more than one million trade jobs remain unfilled — including nearly 500,000 in manufacturing — as retirements outpace new entrants and vocational pipelines fall short. Demand is booming — fueled by projects like infrastructure spending and AI data centers — but execution is hampered by a lack of electricians, welders, HVAC techs and other skilled workers. That shortage is being worsened by immigration crackdowns, which have made it more difficult for some facilities to hire workers. This is unpredictability in its most human form. Financing can get the ball rolling, but without people to do the work, progress stalls, regardless of industry. The Path Forward The work of creating predictability starts with practical, often unglamorous moves. Procurement intelligence can help firms get ahead of input volatility, using data and forecasting to stabilize costs before they spiral. Supply chain resilience — whether through diversified sourcing, supplier redundancy or nearshoring — turns tariff shocks from existential threats into manageable business expenses. And workforce investment, from trade schools to apprenticeships to smarter immigration policy, is the only real answer to the labor shortages that no interest rate cut can fix. This is the new arms race in business — building certainty in an uncertain world. Companies that can manufacture their own predictability will trade at higher multiples, attract stronger partners and outlast competitors who mistake rate relief for a strategy. Like electricity, predictability is invisible until it’s gone. Rate cuts may brighten the room for a moment, but it’s the infrastructure of predictability that keeps the lights on.

"On Monday, an anonymous Facebook user uploaded an image in the Dunkin’ World Facebook group, which has more than 550,000 members featuring what seemed to be internal pour directions for a variety of coffee and other drinks orders. As per the image, iced beverages like lattes and signature lattes, macchiatos, matchas, chais, cappuccinos, Americanos, and other drinks that include shakin’ espressos, should never be filled to the top of a cup. The instructions also allegedly indicate that the same amount of beverage should be poured no matter whether a customer requests reduced or no ice. Instead, the paper suggests that beverages should be filled to the ice line, identified by three red squares on a Dunkin’ cup. If customers request for less ice, the ice should only reach the second red line. The Facebook poster stated that the paper featured a new company policy, though it is not confirmed whether the instructions are new or official. Some commenters, stating to be Dunkin’ employees, mentioned that the directions were authentic. Dunkin’ did not rapidly respond to Fortune’s request for remark. Exceptions: Drinks That Can Be Topped The instructions also explain that specific beverages, like Dunkin’ Refreshers, Dunkin’ Energy drinks, or Iced Tea Lemonades, should still be filled to the top when ordered with no ice. “These beverages use measurements that account for ice in the cup,” the instructions cited. “When made in the cup without ice, the ingredient ratios will be wrong and the beverage will not taste right. We do not recommend building these beverages with no ice.”Why Did the Leak Cause So Much Backlash: Customer Reactions The leak ignited criticism among some consumers. “Just paid $6+ for a large cookie butter cloud latte, with less ice, to not get filled to the top because their new fill policy says they will not do it, on purpose,” the original poster stated. “Sending to everyone so that they are aware what they will be receiving.”Other social media users mentioned that baristas will fill cups to the top upon request, but people may be charged additional for the extra pour, as reduced or no ice does not necessarily compensate for more liquid in the cup. What Role Do Tariffs Play in Beverage Pricing? Industry analysts highlight rising prices as a contributing factor. Wholesale coffee bean costs have elevated over the past year in regard to new tariffs on significant suppliers like Brazil, prompting some coffee chains to raise consumer costs by 15%–20%. Meanwhile, the Trump administration moved recently to reverse some tariffs, that includes those on coffee, in an attempt to reduce costs.Starbucks and Dunkin’ together control approximately 85% of the U.S. coffee market, as per The Wall Street Journal, stating data from Morgan Stanley. However, latest chains such as Dutch Bros., which appeal to Gen Z with customizable beverages and visually attractive offerings famous on Instagram and TikTok, are slowly spotting market share. Has Dunkin Responded to the Leak? As of now, Dunkin’ has not revealed an official statement on the reported policy, leaving several customers questioning whether their iced drinks are being served with less liquid than expected.Source: Fortune.com FAQs: What is the Dunkin ice policy controversy? The controversy arrived from a leaked image suggesting iced beverages shouldn’t be filled to the top. Customers showed their frustration over paying full cost but receiving less liquid. Which drinks are impacted by the alleged policy? Lattes, macchiatos, chais, Americanos, cappuccinos, and shakin’ espressos are allegedly affected. Some beverages, such as Dunkin’ Refreshers, can still be poured to the top.

"In the tasting room of a Bordeaux winery, a photo on the wall shows a pastoral tableau: three generations of the Dubois family, sipping wine on the patio of their Les Bertrands château, with their Australian shepherd, Namek, perched at their feet. Out the window, chestnut trees sway in the breeze, with sunlit vines stretching for acres beyond. It’s this mesmerizing serenity that draws millions of tourists to southwest France every year to revel in the craftsmanship and lifestyle that have made Bordeaux an icon of the $515 billion global wine industry. Last year, the region produced 484 million bottles, about 14% of France’s output; according to the Bordeaux Wine Council, every 15 seconds, somewhere in the world, someone buys a bottle of Bordeaux. But the idyllic calm is deceptive. Amid the old stone villages and winding gravel roads, winemakers are reeling from a multitude of problems that feel largely out of their control—from geopolitics and trade tensions to the changing tastes of younger consumers. Traveling through Bordeaux, one thing seems clear: It will take more than the traditional Christmas spike in wine sales to turn things around. “The crisis is very strong,” says Laurent Dubois, 57, sipping espresso, not wine, one morning in the tasting room during a break in the harvest. “We have never seen this.” Until recently, Dubois believed his business had faced every imaginable challenge. He is the ninth generation to run Château Les Bertrands, which his ancestor François founded in 1692, in the village of Reignac; his family tree is displayed prominently on one wall, and his son Amaury, 31, has just joined the business as the 10th generation. The family has cultivated vines here through the French Revolution, the Great Depression, and occupation by the Nazis, who moored U‑boats on the nearby coast, commandeered wineries, and cleaned out the cellars. But the threats this time might be more existential. Global wine sales and production are at their lowest levels in more than 60 years, according to the Paris-based International Organization of Vine and Wine (or OIV), which publishes the industry’s benchmark data. Unveiling the 2024 figures this spring, OIV statistics chief Giorgio Delgrosso warned that the trend was the result not only of current economic and political pressures but also “structural, long-term factors.” While 2025 data has not yet been compiled, the organization is bracing for more disappointment. Since 2019, wine-drinking worldwide has dropped about 12%; it has fallen even further in the U.S., the world’s biggest wine market and Bordeaux’s single biggest export market. Just 54% of American adults now drink alcohol—the lowest rate in 90 years, according to a recent Gallup poll. Even the French, who drink more wine than anyone else in Europe, are consuming 4.9% less than they did in 2000, and France’s professional winemakers association projects that consumption could fall another 20% over the next decade. In areas like Bordeaux, where the backbone of the wine industry comprises hundreds of small, family-owned châteaux, rather than big, diversified corporations, these trends feel particularly destabilizing: Bound by tradition and lacking in scale, it’s difficult for these winemakers to pivot quickly to new strategies. They’re grappling with an unfamiliar question: Is a full comeback even feasible, or will they need to permanently overhaul their business models? Families like the Duboises are under pressure to future-proof their companies—and there’s no telling how soon any solution could take root. Among the many challenges analysts point to, the one that seems most worrying is this: Younger consumers are making dramatically different choices, just at the age when they’re forming lifelong habits. Consider that until 1981, French kids as young as 14 were served wine with their school lunch—a boon for the industry. But “Gen Z does not drink as much as prior generations,” says Jon Moramarco, managing director of alcohol consultancy BW166 in Broomfield, Colo. Wooing new young oenophiles has proved intensely difficult, especially since COVID hit in 2020 and shut bars and restaurants for months. Many younger adults went out far less frequently after venues reopened—their shrinking incomes have not helped. When Gen Zers do opt for alcohol, studies show that they prefer cocktails, canned hard seltzers, and more exotic, affordable wines from Latin America and even China over traditional vintages like Bordeaux. Gen Z also tends to skew more health-conscious, and many are heeding new warnings against even moderate drinking. The industry faces challenges from the other end of the demographic spectrum, too, as the global population ages. “People over 65 drink about 20% less than people between 50 and 65,” Moramarco says. If abstinence was winemakers’ only challenge, it might be manageable: In Bordeaux, vintners have launched hundreds of zero-alcohol wines, and Bordeaux city even has a new alcohol-free wine bar. But trade conflicts are also aggravating the downturn. After Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022, the European Union banned the sale in Russia of high-end wines worth more than €300 a bottle. Last year, EU wine exports to the country sank to the lowest level in 20 years; French wine accounts for about half of those exports. Then came trouble from across the Atlantic. The dollar has dropped in value by about 12% against the euro since President Trump—America’s teetotaler-in-chief—returned to the White House. That makes French wines far more expensive in American stores and restaurants. The weak greenback has hit especially hard in Bordeaux. Its wineries shipped 30 million bottles to the U.S. in the 12 months leading to September, earning about 430 million euros (about $500 million). But in dollar terms, Bordeaux sales in the U.S. last year dropped 8.4%, according to French export figures. As if all that were not enough, Trump imposed blanket 15% tariffs on EU goods entering the U.S., including alcohol, beginning in August. Though lower than some of the rates he had threatened, the tariffs have still represented a significant burden. The region’s wines range widely in price, from $10 table wine to more exclusive vintages that retail for $1,000 a bottle and up—but the trade duties put wines at all price levels at a competitive disadvantage. Trump’s tariffs also dealt a blow to the American wine industry, where stores, distributors, and wineries themselves rely on imports from France. (Many U.S. wines are aged in oak barrels made in Cognac, an hour north of Bordeaux.) In April, Manhattan wine importer Victor Schwartz sued the Trump administration—and won—arguing that it was illegal to impose tariffs by using emergency powers. In November, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could decide the ultimate legal fate of those tariffs. But Schwartz says the damage has already been done to small companies like his; his profits have sunk 60% since the tariff was announced, he told MSNBC TV in September. In France, of course, the crise is a far hotter political issue. The country’s wine industry is focusing on cutting production to meet the industry’s new reality. The government is seeking €200 million in EU funds to compensate wineries as they shrink. France’s industry organization CNIV, led by Bordeaux winemaker Bernard Farges, advocates ripping out 247,000 acres of French vineyards—about 12.5% of the total—to rightsize output. Farges also wants to overhaul the complex appellation system, in which each small wine-growing area operates independently, thus reducing its marketing and distribution muscle. “We’re all dwarfs,” Farges told visitors at an agricultural fair in Paris. “We need export champions.” In Bordeaux city one day in September, communications chief Christophe Chateau shows me letters from the council to French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, urging them to plead the industry’s case directly to Trump. The survival of many Bordeaux wineries, the letter explains, depends on American sales. “We’re telling them: ‘Please, the U.S. is a huge market for us. Please find a solution,’” Chateau says. For now, winemakers like Laurent Dubois are left to find their own solutions. For centuries-old businesses like his, the choices are stark: reenvisioning the future of a family tradition, or accepting that the wine business might need to shrink significantly. To Dubois, each choice seems a painful recogni‑ tion that this crisis might be irreversible. He says he plans to increase shipments from Château Les Bertrands to customers in markets where Bordeaux sales are growing fast, like Thailand, Cambodia, and Singapore. He also plans to rip out about one-fifth of his 320 acres of vines over the next two years, lowering output from 800,000 bottles a year to 600,000. And he is rethinking the 50,000 bottles of kosher wine he ships yearly to New York, where demand has dropped as younger generations choose alcohol less steeped in old-world traditions, or no alcohol at all. After 333 years harvesting vines here, the château is in flux. Dubois says he is studying what else the family can cultivate, including planting olive, fruit, and nut trees. Selling the château is a losing proposition these days. Moving forward, he says, “we will produce only the quantity we sell.” Drinking problems Changing habits and trade conflicts have disrupted the economics of the wine industry This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “Tariff threats and Gen Z sobriety have put Bordeaux on red alert.”",right
"US Agrees to Cut Swiss Tariffs to 15% After Investment Pledge The US and Switzerland reached a preliminary trade agreement to lower tariffs on many Swiss goods including watches from 39% to 15%, in a measure of relief for the country’s beleaguered exporters. (Bloomberg) — The US and Switzerland reached a preliminary trade agreement to lower tariffs on many Swiss goods including watches from 39% to 15%, in a measure of relief for the country’s beleaguered exporters. The pending deal brings respite to Switzerland, which was hit by the highest levy the Trump administration imposed on any developed country. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer announced the deal earlier in television interview. Swiss officials had been engaged in intense diplomacy since the higher rate was announced in August, pushing to get a better deal. Bloomberg News reported on Monday that Switzerland and the US were moving close to a 15% rate. In exchange, companies from Switzerland and Liechtenstein have committed to investing $200 billion over the next five years — including $67 billion in 2026 — to create manufacturing and research and development jobs, according to a White House fact sheet. The White House said the investments would create jobs in a number of sectors, including pharmaceuticals, machinery, medical devices, gold manufacturing, aerospace, and energy infrastructure. The tariff rate on pharmaceutical goods and semiconductors will also be capped at 15% if Trump seeks to impose additional sectoral levies. Switzerland and Liechtenstein also intend to remove a range of tariffs across the agricultural and industrial sectors, according to the White House, including on fresh and dried nuts, fish and seafood, certain fruits, chemicals, and spirits such as whiskey and rum. Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin spoke to reporters in the capital Bern to explain the agreement, stressing that the previous tariff affected about 40% of its exports but that the country “has not made any concessions which would threaten its neutrality or independence.” By securing a tariff that matches the levy on the EU, Swiss exporters have put themselves at parity with rivals in the trading bloc. However, it doesn’t give them an advantage over European competitors that don’t have to contend with a strong franc, which earlier Friday climbed to a decade high against the euro. Customers in Switzerland also intend to purchase US-made Boeing Co. planes, said Swiss chief negotiator Helene Budliger Artieda. Roche Holding AG and Novartis AG have pledged to invest more than $70 billion in manufacturing and R&D in the US in the coming years, but it’s not yet clear where the remainder will come from. “The Swiss government cannot oblige companies to make investments,” Budliger Artieda said, adding that the investment commitments in the deal “aren’t legally binding.” Like gold and semiconductors, pharmaceuticals remain exempt from the tariffs for now. Both Roche and Novartis are in talks with the White House over ways to lower drug prices and avoid potential future duties, following recent deals by Pfizer Inc., AstraZeneca Plc and others. Under the deal, Switzerland will also grant the US duty-free bilateral tariff quotas on 500 tonnes of beef, 1,000 tonnes of bison meat and 1,500 tonnes of poultry meat in a rare softening of its agricultural trade barriers. Given the strong Swiss farmers’ lobby, such a move will likely be politically controversial. Shuttle Diplomacy Negotiations to hammer out the framework are to start immediately with a goal of concluding them by the first quarter of next year, the White House said in a statement. The White House also said the Swiss would continue to refrain from imposing a digital services tax, in what would effectively bar them from more extensively taxing the revenue streams of big US tech firms. The trade agreement detailed Friday is the capstone of months of shuttle diplomacy by Swiss government officials and business figures, after the countries’ key industries, including watches, machinery and precision instruments, were punished by the crippling US tariff. Greer earlier Friday said that Switzerland is “going to send a lot of manufacturing here to the United States.” Swiss manufacturers, along with food and chemicals exports, have been the hardest hit by the 39% levy, according to Switzerland’s central bank. The breakthrough ends a months-long dispute that began in August, when Trump imposed the 39% tariff on Swiss exports, more than double the rate applied to the EU. The move, which the Trump administration justified as a response to what officials described as a $40 billion goods trade deficit, stunned Swiss officials, who believed they had previously agreed on a deal with US counterparts. A surge in gold exports helped blow out Switzerland’s trade surplus with the US at a sensitive time. Bullion exports of more than $36 billion made up over two-thirds of the US deficit with the Swiss in the first quarter, driven by a tariff arbitrage trade. Switzerland, the central hub of the world’s gold refining industry, offered to invest in the sector in the US earlier this year, in a bid to improve its tariff settlement, Bloomberg reported in September. Momentum shifted this month, when a group of Swiss billionaire executives met Trump in the White House in what was described as a friendly atmosphere. That was in sharp contrast to a heated phone call that took place between the US president and his Swiss counterpart Karin Keller-Sutter before the August crisis emerged. Absent President The Swiss president has been absent from much of the talks in recent weeks. Instead, Parmelin, who takes over the rotating presidency on Jan. 1 from Keller-Sutter, and Budliger Artieda, have led the Swiss delegations. The pair fielded questions from reporters in Bern on Friday with no sign of the Swiss president who has six weeks left in office. —With assistance from Fabienne Kinzelmann, Levin Stamm, Allegra Catelli, Jan-Henrik Förster and Fergal O’Brien.

"President Donald Trump late Thursday said that the United States may “almost completely” eliminate the income tax due to the rising tariff revenue. “In the next couple of years, I think we’ll substantially be cutting, or maybe cutting out completely, but we’ll be cutting income tax,” Trump said during an event on Thursday. “Could be almost completely cutting it because the money we’re taking in is going to be so large,” he added. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in June projected that the tariff increases will reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade. Breitbart News Economics Editor John Carney wrote: The tariff estimate covers measures implemented between January 6 and May 13, 2025. These include a 30 percent levy on imports from China and Hong Kong, 25 percent duties on autos, auto parts, steel, and aluminum, a 10 percent general tariff on most other imports, and the elimination of duty-free treatment for low-value Chinese shipments. CBO estimates that, before accounting for economic side effects, the new tariffs will reduce primary deficits by $2.5 trillion and cut interest payments by another $500 billion, for a total deficit reduction of $3.0 trillion. After factoring in modest economic drag — slightly lower GDP and temporarily higher inflation — the net deficit reduction is pegged at $2.8 trillion. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in November said that Trump is proposing a tariff dividend check so that Americans understand the impact of Trump’s tariff policies. “Well, look, the President wants to make sure the American people understand that the tariffs are there for their benefit, right? That it’s — yes, it’s going to drive down our deficit. Yes, it’s going to make the country stronger,” Lutnick said on Fox Business Network’s Kudlow show. “But he wants the people of America, the American people to appreciate these tariffs, and he knows if he puts money into their pocket and says, ‘Look, this was paid for by the tariffs,’ they’ll better understand how important this is for America. And so, that’s why he’s talking about it.” COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Federal tariff revenue soared to historic highs in fiscal year 2025, fueled by the Trump administration’s aggressive trade strategy, according to a new analysis from a leading fiscal watchdog. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) reports that customs duties generated $195 billion this year—a more than 250% jump from the previous year’s tally and a clear signal of the fiscal impact generated by heightened trade measures. Despite this boost, and one-time savings from reforms to student loans amounting to $200 billion, the CRFB notes that the deficit still totaled $1.8 trillion (roughly 6% of GDP), warning that lawmakers will need to identify substantially more deficit reduction to put the $38 trillion national debt on a sustainable path. Customs duty collections, which began the fiscal year under preexisting rates, spiked dramatically as the administration introduced new and expanded tariffs throughout the year. Monthly revenue climbed from $7 billion in January to $30 billion by September, culminating in a total annual tariff collection of $195 billion—nearly $118 billion (or 150%) more than the $77 billion collected in 2024. Much of this revenue—roughly $150 billion—came in the second half of the year, where receipts outpaced the same period last year by almost 300%. The CRFB did not comment in this analysis on exactly who is paying for the tariffs, a subject that is much debated and somewhat opaque given how tariffs are calculated. Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller told CNBC in October that the data he sees suggests that wealthier Americans are bearing a much heavier load from tariff pass-throughs, while Fortune’s Shawn Tully and Steve “the Money Doctor” Hanke wrote in August that the tariffs are really a sales tax in disguise. Student loan savings provide major budget cushion CRFB’s projections suggest that should current tariffs persist, they could yield as much as $3 trillion in revenue from 2025 through 2035, offsetting a major share of the costs associated with recent spending initiatives. Calculated under standard assumptions, this revenue would cover about two-thirds of the primary deficit impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) over the next five years—more if temporary OBBBA provisions expire on schedule. However, this optimistic outlook is clouded by significant legal uncertainty. Many of the Trump-era tariffs—particularly those enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)—have been deemed illegal by lower courts. These rulings have been upheld on appeal but remain under Supreme Court review, with oral arguments scheduled for November and a potential decision before the year’s end. The Trump administration has moved to enact more tariffs not on an IEEPA basis, so even a Supreme Court ruling that the tariffs are as illegal as many scholars say they seem to be on their face could result in other, more technically legal tariffs being erected. Should the Supreme Court affirm the lower courts’ decisions, as much as $90 billion of the $195 billion collected this year could be refunded to importers, per calculations from U.S. Customs, and projected future revenue from these tariffs would fall by more than half. The deficit, as a share of the economy, would climb—annual federal shortfalls are projected to reach 6.7% of GDP, and the national debt would rise to 126% of GDP by 2035.

"President Donald Trump ’s veneer of political invulnerability has begun to crack as he struggles to find his footing on Americans’ concerns about affordability and fails to extinguish a push by renegade Republicans to release more files from the Jeffrey Epstein case. The twin challenges, coming shortly after Democratic victories in recent elections and before next year’s midterm campaigns that will determine control of Congress, represent a sobering situation for a president who has reveled in his unrivaled dominance in Washington. He has overhauled the federal government with brute force, deployed troops in cities around the country, ignored concerns about the legality of military operations and launched remodeling projects like a gilded ballroom attached to the White House. But Trump’s aggressive approach to his second term does not undo political realities, such as dissatisfaction with the economy that festers despite inflation that’s lower than during President Joe Biden’s term. Trump is expected to address the issue at a conference on Monday night. In addition, there’s the inescapable fact that the president is a lame duck who is constitutionally prohibited from running again, despite his interest in remaining in office. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has frequently angered Trump, reminded his party about this on Sunday as he urged lawmakers to support legislation that would force the Justice Department to publish documents about Epstein. “I would remind my Republican colleagues who are deciding how to vote — Donald Trump can protect you in red districts right now by giving you an endorsement,” Massie said on ABC News. “But in 2030, he’s not going to be the president, and you will have voted to protect pedophiles if you don’t vote to release these files, and the president can’t protect you then.” The Epstein files have been a pressure point Epstein, who died by suicide several years ago, was a convicted sex offender infamous for his connections to wealthy and powerful people, making him a fixture of outrage and conspiracy theories about wrongdoing among American elites. Trump has opposed the Epstein bill in the House, describing it as a continuation of investigations that have shadowed him for years, until he abruptly reversed course on Sunday, saying “it’s time to move on” from the issue by announcing his support for the vote. It was an acknowledgement that Trump had suffered a rare defeat in the Republican-controlled Congress, where party members have been reluctant to curtail his authority. Even as he strains to impose his will on Republicans like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, whom he split with over the weekend, Trump also is trying to stave off potential losses in next year’s midterms. If Democrats take control of Congress, they will be empowered to block Trump’s agenda and investigate his administration. He’s been pushing state leaders to redraw congressional districts to improve his party’s chances. On Monday, he stewed that Indiana Republicans weren’t toeing his line, and he announced that he would endorse primary challenges against any lawmaker who doesn’t support redistricting. “We must keep the Majority at all costs,” Trump wrote on social media. “Republicans must fight back!” Voter concerns about the cost of living loom large Holding the line will most likely require addressing Americans’ economic concerns, which have sometimes taken a backseat to Trump’s focus on establishing a foreign policy legacy and scaling up immigration enforcement. Trump conceded Sunday night that some consumer costs are “a little bit higher.” Addressing affordability has prompted Trump to partially backtrack on tariffs, a core part of his economic agenda. His administration reduced levies on imports of products like coffee, beef and tropical fruit, an implicit concession that tariffs have increased costs despite the president’s promises to the contrary. The president has also proposed a $2,000 dividend, funded by tariff revenue, for all Americans except for the rich. But there’s no guarantee that Congress will go along with the idea when the federal government continues to struggle with debt, and sending cash to people could increase the inflation that Trump has pledged to eliminate. Democrats swept elections in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere this month, a sign of discontent with Trump’s handling of the economy. Neil Newhouse, a longtime Republican pollster, said Democratic victories weren’t surprising but “what got our attention was the depth and the breadth of the wins.” He warned that his party risks making the same mistakes as Democratic President Joe Biden, who oversaw high inflation while attempting to convince voters that the problem would soon pass. “We can tell them prices are going down until we’re blue in the face,” Newhouse said. “Unless they’re seeing it at the grocery stores, it doesn’t make a damn bit of difference.”",right
"Trump has options if the Supreme Court blocks him from imposing 'emergency' tariffs WASHINGTON — Countries around the world — Canada included _ are waiting anxiously as the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether President Donald Trump has the authority to continue using his favoured tariff tool. No matter which way the court jumps, however, the Trump administration is expected to maintain some level of tariffs on the United States’ trade partners. “The decision in the Supreme Court would be devastating to our country if we got a negative, devastating if we got a negative decision,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Thursday. The conservative-led U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday related to two separate legal challenges of Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for tariffs. Trump used the national security statute, better known as IEEPA, to impose his so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs and fentanyl-related duties on Canada, Mexico and China. Trump’s top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, faced pointed questions when he appeared before the court Wednesday. Several justices voiced skepticism about the president’s use of IEEPA to pursue his sweeping tariff agenda. The justices closely examined the language in the act _ particularly the wording about the president’s power to “regulate” imports — to determine whether that allows for Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs. Liberal and conservative justices pushed Trump’s lawyer to explain why the president would use the law for tariffs when it doesn’t mention the word “tariff” or any of its synonyms. They also pointed out to Sauer that IEEPA was used repeatedly by prior presidents for things like sanctions, but Trump is the only one ever to use it for tariffs. Sauer argued that Trump is using IEEPA to regulate foreign commerce rather than raise money — despite Trump’s repeated public claims that the duties are making America rich. The U.S. Constitution reserves power over taxation and tariffs for Congress. The justices wrestled with the broader implications of handing wide-ranging tariff powers to the president. Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch suggested that once that power was given to a president, it would be next to impossible for Congress to get it back. “It’s a one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people’s elected representatives,” Gorsuch said. Despite the pushback in Wednesday’s hearing, conservative majority justices have so far been hesitant to rein in the unprecedented expansion of executive power during the Trump administration. America’s top court could have until June to issue a ruling but it’s expected to come sooner. If the court rules against the Trump administration, it likely would nullify the 35 per cent economywide tariffs on Canada. Those duties do not apply to goods compliant with the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement on trade. Trump’s team has said that if the court rules against him, he would look at other available tools to pursue his massive tariff agenda. A reversal at the Supreme Court would make it harder for Trump to change tariff levels on a whim. Congress has passed laws over the past century that allow the president some control over tariffs in certain situations — but they all have more restrictions than IEEPA. Trump might turn to Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which allows a president to hit countries with tariffs of up to 50 per cent if they’re treating imports from other countries more favourably than products from the United States. Section 338 has never been used by a president before. Trump also might look to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows a president to take trade action if an investigation finds a trading partner’s policies are unreasonable and discriminatory. But that law requires country-by-country investigations of trade policy before a tariff can be imposed. Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows a president to implement tariffs of up to 15 per cent to address large and serious balance-of-payments deficits. Those tariffs can only stay in place for 150 days before they require congressional approval to continue. The Supreme Court’s decision will not affect Trump’s expanding use of tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — tariffs that are already hammering Canada’s steel, aluminum, automobile, lumber and copper industries. Trump has indicated he plans to target more industries with these duties.

"The global fashion industry is bracing for 2026, navigating a market defined by geopolitical instability, macroeconomic uncertainty, and, above all, unprecedented U.S. tariffs. As leaders pivot from focusing on “uncertainty” to acknowledging the environment is simply “challenging,” tariffs have emerged as the number one hurdle facing executives. The severity of the trade landscape cannot be overstated, executives told McKinsey and the Business of Fashion for the 2026 edition of The State of Fashion report. U.S. tariffs on apparel and footwear imports, which had been around 13% earlier in 2025, dramatically spiked to 54% following initial government announcements in April. Although rates later eased, the weighted average tariff rate for apparel and footwear from the top 10 importers stood at 36% as of mid-October, well above historical norms. This sudden surge places the apparel and footwear industry among those most exposed to the tariffs’ profound impacts. Reflecting this critical situation, 76% of fashion executives surveyed believe responses to trade disruptions and tariffs will be the single most important factor shaping the industry in 2026. For the 10th anniversary of the report, which began in 2016, McKinsey and Business of Fashion charted the many changes for the industry since 2016, from a generalized “age of volatility” to Asia’s undeniable rise to disruptions in how shoppers shop. For 2026, they chart major issues, including “tariff turbulence” and three emergent shopper appetites: a focus on resale, a sense of “well-being” in their purchases, and a future marked by artificial intelligence (AI). The report finds brands making price changes, shifting sourcing, and improving efficiency in a bid to counteract the impact of tariffs. Larger suppliers are responding by optimizing their footprints while chasing digitization and automation, and smaller players, meanwhile, are under mounting pressure. “Agility will be the defining factor enabling brands and suppliers to maintain their competitive edge.” Amid this economic disruption, Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass spoke to Joan Kennedy of Business of Fashion about how she’s adopted an aggressive and methodical tariff playbook, positioning the 170-year-old denim giant as a standout in managing the chaos. Levi’s advantage, and painful truth Crucially, Levi’s entered this period with a structural advantage: Approximately 60% of its business is international, reducing the tariff burden compared to many domestic competitors who are more heavily penetrated in the U.S. Yet, even with this advantage, the tariff increases demanded strategic action. Gass described the overall environment as “very complex,” encompassing macroeconomic forces, geopolitical issues, and massive disruption in technology and AI, and she articulated the necessary, unavoidable reality of passing some costs on to the consumer, stating plainly: “There’s only so much you can absorb from the tariffs, because they’re just very high.” Levi’s approach to pricing is multifaceted: First, targeted and surgical pricing increases are being implemented, a measure also being taken by most apparel retailers (55% of executives expect further price increases in 2026 in response to tariffs). Second, the company is utilizing promotional levers, specifically pulling back on discounts such as “20% off” events, which helps elevate the brand and mitigate tariff impact by improving margins. Third, the company is pricing for innovation, leveraging new products where consumers are “likely willing to pay more.” Levi’s did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment on more specifics about pricing increases to come. Beyond pricing, Levi’s has prioritized internal operational prowess. Gass, who took over as CEO in 2024, has been driving a course correction focused on transformation, streamlining the business and reducing unwieldy inventory. Tactical moves included cutting slower-selling SKUs. More significantly, the company is undergoing a fundamental “rewiring” to reduce complexity across its network of 120 countries. By increasing the commonality of product across all global stores from less than 10% to about 40%, Levi’s is generating efficiencies across design, sourcing, and merchandising. As Gass summarizes this strategy: “We’re operating in a complex environment, but we ourselves are becoming less complex.” This disciplined approach has delivered results. Levi’s reported a 7% year-on-year increase in quarterly sales in October 2025, posting its fourth consecutive quarter of high-single-digit growth. The company also raised its full-year revenue outlook, even as it cautioned that tariffs would impact margins in the fourth quarter. The industry overall is adapting to the new trade map, with 35% of executives planning to shift sourcing to markets with more favorable trade agreements. However, Levi’s emphasizes that in a volatile trade environment, agility depends heavily on strategic supplier partnerships built on collaboration. Gass noted that Levi’s teams talk to vendors 24/7, treating it as a “relationship business” where sourcing from multiple countries offers crucial flexibility against tariffs and supply-chain disruptions.",right
"Speaking at the 69th Assembly of Presidents of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA), Walsh said “there was huge frustration that the supply chain issues are not getting much better,” even as airlines continue to operate with thin margins. In contrast, he noted that OEMs enjoy much stronger profitability. Taking examples, he said engine makers “are actually improving their financial performance during a period of massive disruption which has added massive costs to the airline industry.” Walsh added that “it is bothering when he hears suppliers talking about that they want to increase prices because of tariffs and other supply chain issues.” “There's got to be a correction to this. Airlines need to be properly rewarded. I don't object to anybody making profits.... But we've got to see a greater balance and we need to see these critical suppliers raising their game and raising their game significantly to ensure that they're serving the industry in the way that we need to be served,” he said. The global aviation sector continues to struggle with prolonged supply-chain bottlenecks since the pandemic, leaving airlines waiting for new aircraft even as passenger demand rebounds sharply. The worldwide commercial aircraft backlog exceeded 17,000 units last year — significantly higher than the 2010–2019 annual average of 13,000 — according to an IATA–Oliver Wyman study. AAPA Director General Subhas Menon warned that tariffs now threaten to slow the already fragile recovery. “Tariffs will impact the nascent recovery of the supply chain and also increase non-fuel cost for the airlines,” he said. He pointed out that while aircraft and engines are exempt, many of the raw materials and components sourced globally are not. “Supply chain recovery is now undermined by tariffs which increase supplier costs. While aircraft and engines are exempt, their raw materials, and components which come from many parts of the world, are not. “Tariffs also affect demand through inflation. It is a double whammy as both supply, and demand sides of the market are affected,” Menon said, even as he reiterated that air transport demand remains strong. On sustainability, Menon said that taxing airlines “directly or indirectly through mandates has not worked” and noted that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production remains low. The IATA–Oliver Wyman study estimates that supply-chain challenges will cost airlines more than USD 11 billion in 2025, driven by excess fuel burn, additional maintenance, increased engine leasing and higher inventory-holding expenses.

"Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins declared on Monday during an interview about affordability that the American dream is making a comeback under the Trump administration and ""real relief"" was coming ""very soon."" ""But as we’re restructuring the entire economy, as we’re bringing down inflation, bringing down fuel, bringing down labor, Americans, we believe, will see real relief very, very soon. Those numbers are already down, but much more to come,"" she told CNBC. ""This administration has been incredibly focused on getting the American dream back into every American’s home and goals, et cetera. And affordability is a huge piece of that. Of course, I’m the agriculture secretary. So food, food production, supporting our farmers and ranchers is a big piece,"" she said. Affordability has been a dominant political topic in 2025, with Democrats like Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race successfully touting addressing price concerns on the campaign trail. President Donald Trump was elected in 2024 in part on frustration with inflation and affordability under the Biden administration, but new polls show impatience with his economic stewardship. TRUMP GROWS FRUSTRATED WITH GOP FOR NOT TOUTING HIS ‘GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY’ Rollins said that the previous administration was a different story. ""And when you look at under Joe Biden the last four years, we had an increase in inputs, interest rates, 73%, fertilizer, 36%, labor increased 47%… No new trade deals during those four years, no way to move the food out,"" she said. ""So when you look at all of that in total, it’s no surprise that what we inherited was an absolute economic mess. But those numbers are coming down."" She added that nonetheless, ""There are a few outliers. And you mentioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent talked about a couple of those yesterday. We’re working on those extremely diligently."" In response to the trajectory of Trump's tariff agenda, Rollins explained that she has been at Trump’s side for a long time and has seen measurable results. ""His vision of realigning the entire world economy around putting American products first and America first, but also using tariffs as a really important economic tool to make sure that we are doing everything we can for our country and to keep our country at the top of the world,"" she said. ""But what the president did was using these as economic tools, but also important foreign policy tools as well."" WHEN DID MAGA BECOME MAKE ARGENTINA GREAT AGAIN? She juxtaposed the Trump administration with the preceding Biden administration again, noting the variety of new trade deals that have emerged. ""What the president did with liberation day, with enacting all these tariffs back in February. We now have dozens of new trade deals, and within Indonesia, Australia, Japan, EU, England, it’s just remarkable. And a lot of these deals people tried for 20, 25 years to get these deals again. Under the last administration, we didn’t have one new trade deal. We went from an agriculture trade surplus under Trump to a deficit, $50 billion deficit in just agriculture,"" she said. ""So think about the effects on our farmers and ranchers. $50 billion is a significant amount when you’re growing corn or soybeans or apples or whatever you’re growing. So being able to solve for that, which now we’re doing again, it’s incredible."" American farmers, she said, have been Trump’s priority since the beginning of his initial campaign and will be receiving forthcoming aid. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The White House last week pointed to a bevy of deals Trump has made since his return to the Oval Office that underscore his focus on affordability for the American people: cutting regulations to unleash American energy to lower fuel and other costs, multiple deals to lower drug prices and attracting business to set up shop on U.S. soil to promote American jobs.

"Trump Says Close to India Trade Deal to Bring Tariffs Down President Donald Trump said he “at some point” would reduce the tariff rate on Indian goods, saying the US was getting “pretty close” to a trade deal with New Delhi. (Bloomberg) — President Donald Trump said he “at some point” would reduce the tariff rate on Indian goods, saying the US was getting “pretty close” to a trade deal with New Delhi. “Right now they don’t love me, but they’ll love us again,” Trump said. “We’re getting a fair deal.” Trump later predicted the nations were “pretty close to doing a deal that’s good for everybody.” The comments were the latest signal of a possible thaw in the trade dispute that has soured the relationship between Washington and New Delhi. India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Trump earlier this year slapped additional tariffs on India’s exports to the US in part to pressure New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil, raising the rates on many Indian goods to 50%. That added tensions to an already contentious negotiation over what the US has cast as India’s high levies and other barriers on American goods. But in recent weeks, Trump has said that Modi has pledged to wind down purchases of crude from Russia and expressed optimism about trade talks. “They’ve stopped doing the Russian oil – it’s been reduced very substantially,” the president said on Monday. “Yeah, we’re going to be bringing the tariffs down, I mean at some point.” Following Trump’s sanctions on two of Russia’s largest crude producers last month, Indian refiners — who had been snapping up discounted Russian oil for the past three years — have begun scaling back purchases from Moscow. Trade teams from both India and the US have met multiple times since the easing of tensions and officials in New Delhi have expressed cautious optimism that a deal with the US is in sight. The talks are progressing well and India is waiting for a response from the US, a government official, who didn’t want to be named as the discussions are private, said Tuesday evening in New Delhi. Trump was speaking at the swearing-in for Sergio Gor, the former head of his personnel office who is now becoming the US ambassador to India. Trump said Gor had already developed a “friendly” relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “As ambassador, Sergio will work to fortify our country’s bonds, promote investments in key US industries and technologies, increase American energy exports and expand our security cooperation,” Trump said. —With assistance from Shruti Srivastava, Diksha Madhok and Abhay Singh.

"President Donald Trump suggested that the ""full benefit"" of tariffs has not yet been realized because their impact has been blunted by stockpiles of goods amassed to avoid paying the tariffs— but he suggested that those stockpiles are dwindling and the full force of his tariffs will soon take hold. ""Despite the massive amount of money being made by the United States of America, Hundreds of Billions of Dollars, as a direct result of Tariffs being charged to other countries, the full benefit of the Tariffs has not yet been calculated in that many of the buyers of goods and products, in order to avoid paying the Tariffs in the short term, ‘STOCK UP’ by purchasing far more inventory than they can use,"" Trump declared in a Monday morning Truth Social post. ""That heavy inventory purchase is now, however, wearing thin, and soon Tariffs will be paid on everything they apply to, without avoidance, and the amounts payable to the USA will SKYROCKET, over and above the already historic levels of dollars received,"" he continued. TRUMP TRADE OFFICIAL SAYS $2K TARIFF PAYMENTS WON'T FUEL INFLATION AS REVENUES CLIMB Trump suggested that tariffs will bolster U.S. wealth and security. ""These payments will be RECORD SETTING, and put our Nation on a new and unprecedented course.

Those opposing us are serving hostile foreign interests that are not aligned with the success, safety and prosperity of the USA. They couldn’t care less about us,"" he wrote. But it appears that much of the public does not share the president's enthusiasm for tariffs. FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SAY WHITE HOUSE IS DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD ON ECONOMY A Fox News Poll of registered voters conducted earlier this month found that only 35% approve of how Trump is handling tariffs, while a whopping 63% disapprove.

"While President Trump’s unorthodox deal making style has intentionally resembled a “bull in a china shop,” it was more like a placid cow in a field last week in China. The world collectively took a deep breath following the U.S.-China Summit, as neither Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping escalated the ongoing trade war between the two nations. However, among global leaders, business chief executives, and everyday consumers, many questions remain. Yesterday I asked 35 sophisticated Chinese CEOs if the Summit was a “12” on a grading scale of one to 10. Perhaps unsurprisingly, only two agreed. As the summit has been examined from nearly every possible angle, two primary narratives have emerged. On the one hand, engaging constructively is a positive step, even if small. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon highlighted this on Fox Business. He emphasized the importance of the heads of the two largest economies meeting face-to-face to reach “a more constructive place than we’ve been over the course of the last couple of months.” Solomon said he does not believe a decoupling will occur, but he appropriately asserted that the U.S. needs a new policy to address longstanding market manipulations by China. On the other hand, virtually no progress has been made with China since Trump took office, despite all the drama. Derek Scissors, American Enterprise Institute’s Asia Economist, embraced the more pessimistic interpretation on CNBC. He vehemently argued that “the meeting itself was a waste of time,” going on to explain how “US policy is pretty much where it was when President Trump took office.” Both are correct. But the meeting was far more consequential than these two viewpoints permit—and not just because the U.S. 100% tariff threat or Chinese rare earths export control were averted. The key fact is that the Trump-Xi Summit revealed the limits of Trump’s tariff war and exposed that a long-term solution is nowhere on the horizon. Trump, famous for his bullying tactics, knows well that there is only one practical answer to a bully: collective action. As the Trump administration often contends, the U.S. holds significant influence in global trade as the largest consumer. Yet, what often goes unsaid is that the world is more dependent on Chinese goods than it is on the American consumer. With this leverage, Xi has bullied countries into accepting China’s subsidized products, pressed businesses to relinquish intellectual property, and pushed unwanted foreign competitors out. While Trump is among the best at combating collective action, he has proven less capable at building it. His tariff tirade has made it impossible for him to build a strong consensus in response to China’s predatory trade machinations. So, who’s the bully and who’s getting bullied? Abuse of Tariffs for Personal Crusades Trump has abused the potency of tariffs for the purported promotion of economic security by using them as a weapon to settle personal scores or take advantage of weaker nations. This past week, the president levied an incremental 10% tariff on Canada after the friendly neighbor to the north aired a controversial but accurate and costly TV ad during the widely watched World Series. In a response last week, the Wall Street Journal‘s editorial board slammed Trump’s actions, calling them a “tantrum” and accusing him of “taking Reagan’s trade beliefs in vain.” The Journal editors, mocking Trump, clarified the facts: “Mr. Trump is wrong about the Reagan speech, and he was wrong when he said on social media that ‘Ronald Reagan LOVED tariffs for purposes of National Security and the Economy.’ The Gipper was a free trader.” In July, Trump imposed an additional 40% tariff on all exports from Brazil unless it dropped the “witch hunt” prosecution of former President and Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro. South Africa received steep tariffs over what Trump considers a mistreatment of white farmers and discriminatory land reform policies. Similarly, earlier this fall, at our September Yale Washington CEO Caucus, 82% condemned the Trump administration using tariff policies to interfere in the peaceful, domestic political events of foreign countries, such as in the Brazilian Supreme Court decision against Jair Bolsonaro. Plus, there are the damaging indiscriminate predatory tariffs that have been exacted on small, fragile nations, such as Lesotho and Laos. The exploitation of tariffs does little to persuade potential international partners to endure economic hardship in opposition to China’s market maneuvers. Paired with a mercurial president, the risk of being abandoned by a self-interested ally now appears greater than the threat of dependence on a country with which they are not currently engaged in a bizarre trade war. In fact, roughly 60% denied that their capital investments into domestic manufacturing/infrastructure will ever be stimulated, in the short term or long term, due to President Trump’s tariff policies with 71% seeing the tariffs as harmful. Uncertainty to Persist for Businesses and Consumers The uncertainty caused by tariffs has slowed economic growth and punished the industrial base of longstanding U.S. partners and allies, making them more vulnerable to would-be Chinese coercion. Unfortunately, those who had hoped for more certainty after the summit were left wanting. Export controls on rare earths were only offset for one year, or until the entente once again frays—something that seems likely, given that access to the critical minerals is dependent on Chinese access to U.S. semiconductors. Trump, though, has already ruled out the possibility of China obtaining the most advanced chips. Still, he maintains the U.S. will only serve as an arbiter in the discussions between Nvidia and China. U.S. port fees on China’s maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding industries were also temporarily lifted, despite the initial idea that those charges were to be part of a broader strategy to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry. On the plus side, China agreed to buy “large amounts” of US soybean meal and other farm goods and to cooperate in efforts to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that Beijing has only agreed to buy the same number of soybeans as it has on average over the past five years. Similarly, many may recall that Xi had promised to buy more soybeans and reduce the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. during Trump’s first term. But those promises, along with most other terms in the “Phase One Agreement,” never came to pass. In fact, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative initiated an investigation into China’s apparent failure to fulfill its 2020 commitments just days before the summit last week. “China appears not to have lived up to its commitments under the Phase One Agreement with respect to non-tariff barriers, market access issues, and purchases of U.S. goods and services,” according to the press release. Five years later, the latest round of negotiations failed to address any of these issues—or even reach a general trade agreement for that matter. AEI’s Derek Scissor was partly right. The U.S. has returned to its pre-Trump administration state. Although, it is far more expensive to manufacture goods at home and abroad, and the economic affairs of foreign partners are significantly weaker today than they were in January. The Canadian economy is weakening due to a “structural transition” from U.S. tariffs that has “destroyed some of the capacity” in the country, according to Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem. To the south, Mexico’s GDP contracted in the third quarter, sparking fears of a recession, as the industrial sector, ranging from mining to construction to manufacturing, has been severely impacted by trade tensions. Meanwhile, German manufacturing orders have come to a standstill amid tariff uncertainty, even outpacing the precipitous decline experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, narrowly avoiding a recession. The Eurozone, more broadly, has not fared much better. Surrendering the Perception of Power to China The Trump tariffs have given Xi opportunities to publicly emphasize new areas of power balance between China and the U.S. through retaliatory actions. The whispers of China’s rise have been ongoing since the Obama administration, but the power that was unintentionally ceded due to the actions taken by the first and second Trump administrations cannot be overlooked. The trade war under Trump 1.0 sparked a surge in China’s pursuit of economic self-sufficiency and strategic positioning along critical supply lines. Since then, Xi has sought to fortify Chinese industry titans, including Huawei, China Rare Earths Group, and EV maker BYD. While Trump has waged economic warfare against the world, Xi has intensified his charm offensive, presenting the Asian nation as a stable, multilateral partner in contrast to an unpredictable, unilateral, and oppressive regime. As Trump has dismantled institutions meant to project American soft power, Xi has expanded efforts to boost China’s reputation—from investments in major rail projects in Southeast Asia and large ports in South America to premier think tanks shaping discourse in Africa and Latin America among political, business, and academic leaders—all the while he continues to discredit the U.S.’s standing. The Trump-Xi Summit ultimately revealed a fundamental flaw in the administration’s strategy: Trump has started a trade war that the U.S. cannot win alone. Tackling China’s market manipulations requires the collective action that Trump has systematically undermined through his indiscriminate use of tariffs. Paradoxically, the market distortions that the tariff “stick” most aspires to eliminate in China—the subsidies, intellectual property theft, and forced technology transfers that are the most justified targets—are the least likely to be remedied due to the collateral damage inflicted on America’s allies through Trump’s protectionism. Without carrots to complement the stick, the U.S. risks becoming isolated as its leverage diminishes. The problem is, when you overuse a stick, it tends to break—even if it is an American stick.

"- In today’s CEO Daily: Diane Brady talks to USA Rare Earth CEO Barbara Humpton. - The big story: Trump calls for the execution of six Democrats. - The markets: Down, down, and down. - Plus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune. Good morning. Ronald Reagan once joked that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’ There may be an exception to that saying: helping U.S. companies compete in rare earths, a realm where China now dominates mining, refining, and manufacturing. That commitment certainly matters to Barbara Humpton, who last month left the top job at Siemens USA to become CEO of USA Rare Earth. Founded in Oklahoma in 2019, the company’s mission is to develop a domestic supply chain for magnets made with rare-earth elements, which are critical in everything from electric vehicles and computers to renewable energy and advanced manufacturing. “I’m delighted that I’ve arrived to find that the Trump administration is laser-focused on this,” she told me. “In the case of semiconductors, the U.S. holds some really important cards, but in rare earths, it’s rather the opposite, right?” Washington has not yet bought a stake in USA Rare Earth (market cap: $1.62 billion), but Humpton said she has been in close communication with the Administration. As MP Materials CEO James Litinsky, whose mining company is now one of several partly owned by the U.S. government, recently told my colleague Jordan Blum: “This is really a Manhattan Project-style effort with all-out intensity.” What’s surprised Humpton most during her first weeks on the job is that, as an industry, “we have not yet begun to operate as a healthy market outside of China.” Her plan: Go to the most fragile parts of the supply chain, invest, and scale to fix any bottlenecks in supply and production. As a first step, the company recently announced the acquisition of Less Common Metals, a U.K.-based company that Humpton describes as “the only scaled metal and alloy maker outside of China, so we can dramatically scale that weakest link in the supply chain.” As for Reagan’s warning: “I think government engagement matters right now,” said Humpton. “Once the flywheel gets going and we have robust capabilities outside of China, I believe the market will sustain itself, but we have to be on a sharp lookout for dumping.” Then again, as we’ve seen with renewables, what one President giveth, another can taketh away. But, as she argues, “this is probably the most bipartisan issue in our government right now, to make sure that we are not dependent on China.” Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Top news Trump calls for the execution of six Democratic members of Congress The Democratic lawmakers, concerned over Trump’s use of troops against Americans on U.S. soil, had made a video urging members of the military to refuse illegal orders. Trump responded by demanding their arrest, trial, and the death penalty. “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” he said on social media. The White House said it had not issued any illegal orders, and the Democrats did not cite any examples of such orders.

Titus has called for a public hearing and federal investigation into the company’s Vegas Loop project and the safety concerns that Fortune has consistently reported on over the past two years. Gov. Lombardo’s press secretary did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Zelensky says he is ready to talk about U.S. peace plan The president of Ukraine said he is ready to discuss “their vision” for peace, referring to Washington’s 28-point peace plan to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. Although the plan contains some military security guarantees from NATO and the U.S., it is unlikely to be acceptable to Zelensky because it requires Ukraine to cede territory to Russia and reduce the size of its military, leaving it vulnerable to further incursion from Moscow. Rise in ‘Bad PIKs’ shows ‘cracks’ in private credit market The number of private credit deals that are changed after the initial deal is signed to include more risky terms for the lender is on the rise, according to Brian Garfield, Lincoln International’s managing director and head of U.S. portfolio valuations. 10.6% of all deals now feature a “payment-in-kind” (PIK), and of those a majority, 57.2%, are “bad PIKs,” where the original deal was changed prior to maturity. Trump’s tariff rollback takes a chunk out of projected deficit reductions New budget projections from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that Trump’s recent rollbacks of his tariffs have negated nearly $800 billion in expected reductions from U.S. deficits. In August, the agency projected that the tariff policy at that point could reduce the deficit by $3.3 trillion through 2035.

"Tariff revenues are dramatically falling short of initial White House expectations, generating roughly $100 billion less than projected, according to a recent analysis from Pantheon Macroeconomics. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicted in August that tariffs would raise “well over half a trillion, maybe toward a trillion-dollar number,” but data compiled through Nov. 25 implies that customs and excise taxes annualize to only $400 billion. This shortfall stems from an average effective tariff rate (AETR) that is far lower than anticipated. The AETR is currently estimated at just 12%, falling significantly short of the nearly 20% widely expected earlier this spring. Even the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) was surprised, reducing its estimate of the pre-substitution tariff rate to 16.5% from 20.5% last month. Pantheon Macro chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs and senior U.S. economist Oliver Allen identified three primary factors driving the lower-than-expected AETR, starting with the U.S.’s relationship with China. In short, the plunge in trading activity with China isn’t being made up for with fresh tariff revenue. 1. China imports plunge and rerouting The first major factor is the sharp decline in imports from China, which have plunged by 30%. China’s share of total U.S. imports has dropped to just 9%, down from 13% in 2024. Companies are quite clearly rerouting trade through Vietnam, Pantheon found. Imports from Vietnam have surged to account for 6% of all imports, up from 4% last year, driven by “huge increases in imports of game consoles, TVs, and clothes.” All of these bear a 20% tariff, below the nearly 50% rate applied to Chinese imports. 2. USMCA compliance exceeds expectations Second is the result of a Trump policy from his first term in office: the long-heralded renegotiation of NAFTA known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). It turns out the proportion of goods entering the U.S. tariff-free from Canada and Mexico under USMCA is much higher than initial estimates suggested. The White House estimated in March that 38% of Canadian imports and 50% of Mexican imports were covered by the USMCA. After Trump’s surprise tariff hikes on each country this year, subject to negotiation downward, goods not compliant with USMCA rules are currently tariffed at 35% from Canada and 25% from Mexico, with the exception of a 10% tariff on energy resources from Canada. This suggests the realized AETRs for those countries should have been approximately 18% and 13%, respectively. However, the data shows realized AETRs in August were just 5% in both Canada and Mexico. This implies a substantial increase in the share of imports entering under the USMCA deal. Pantheon Macro says businesses in Canada and Mexico have likely become far more rigorous in providing information to U.S. customs to prove the origin of components in their products, a practice they had little incentive to follow under the previous tariff structure. In other words, Canada and Mexico are making sure they get the USMCA tariff exemption, and it’s throwing off the White House calculations, which were based off previous, less compliant cross-border trade. 3. Surge in tariff-exempt AI equipment The third factor diluting the overall AETR is a surge in imports of goods exempt from tariffs this year. Specifically, imports of “automatic data processing machines”—which largely include personal computers and advanced chips used for artificial intelligence—have soared. These imports now account for 9% of all total imports, a significant increase from 4% in 2024. This surge in high-tech imports actually disguised a 10% year-over-year fall in imports of other products in August. This appears to be a one-off, or one-year kind of exception. “We think U.S. firms are depleting inventory of imported goods for now,” Pantheon wrote, adding the likelihood of the Supreme Court striking down roughly 60% of the current tariff regime under the IEEPA law “is temporarily incentivizing businesses to postpone placing new orders for imports.” If the current tariffs remain in place, the one-year nature of this inventory depletion means tariff-applicable imports should recover next year, with Pantheon calculating them at $36 billion per month, with the AETR ticking up to 13%. “Even so, tariff revenues still would be much lower than the White House envisaged when it announced the rates.” That said, the $400 billion annualized number is even larger than some other previous calculations that were deemed “very significant” by Torsten Sløk, chief economist of Apollo Global Management. A respected voice on Wall Street, Sløk wrote in September that even a $350 billion revenue figure from tariffs represented a significant item in the U.S. budget. But each reduction in tariffs is wiping out more and more deficit reduction, with the CBO slashing its estimates recently to reveal something around $1 trillion in savings that have evaporated amid Trump reducing his levies on other countries’ goods. In the meantime, the tariffs that remain are functioning more and more like a tax, since other countries and international companies don’t pay for them—U.S. companies and consumers do. LendingTree calculated tariffs will cost American shoppers some $29 billion this holiday season, while investment bank UBS states it plainly: “The tariffs are a big tax increase.” The most immediate impact of the trade regime is felt in rising prices, which are “keeping things elevated.” Estimating a weighted-average tariff rate of 13.6%, UBS calculated that tariffs will add 0.8 percentage points to core PCE inflation in 2026, erasing roughly a year’s worth of disinflation progress.",right
"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott designated the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the Muslim Brotherhood as foreign terrorist and transnational criminal organizations Tuesday, preventing both groups from obtaining land in the Lone Star state. Abbott said in a statement that he made the move as ""The Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR have long made their goals clear: to forcibly impose Sharia law and establish Islam’s ‘mastership of the world.’"" ""The actions taken by the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR to support terrorism across the globe and subvert our laws through violence, intimidation, and harassment are unacceptable. Today, I designated the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR as foreign terrorist organizations and transnational criminal organizations,"" Abbott added. ""These radical extremists are not welcome in our state and are now prohibited from acquiring any real property interest in Texas."" A proclamation signed by Abbott claims that CAIR ""is an Islamist organization that, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigations, was founded as a ‘front group’ for ‘Hamas and its support network’ in the United States."" REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS DEMAND TREASURY PROBE CAIR OVER ALLEGED HAMAS TIES AND TERRORISM CONCERNS It added that, ""CAIR and its members have repeatedly employed, affiliated with, and supported individuals promoting terrorism-related activities,"" including Ghassan Elashi, a founding member of the Texas branch for CAIR and Treasurer of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development charity ""who was sentenced to a total of 65 years in prison for financing terrorism in 2009."" The proclamation also states that Hamas was ""formed in 1987 as the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood"" and that ""activities of the Muslim Brotherhood branches have similarly been limited or prohibited by the governments of Austria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates in light of the Muslim Brotherhood engaging in terrorism or attempting to destabilize those countries."" In a statement to Fox News Digital, CAIR described itself as ""an independent American civil rights organization that has spent 30 years protecting free speech, advancing religious freedom, and promoting justice for people here and abroad."" ABBOTT VOWS TO IMPOSE A ‘100% TARIFF’ ON ANYONE MOVING FROM NYC TO TEXAS AFTER ELECTION DAY ""We have consistently condemned all forms of unjust violence, including hate crimes, ethnic cleansing, genocide and terrorism. In fact, we condemn terrorism so often that ISIS once put a target on our national executive director,"" the organization said. ""Although we are flattered by Greg Abbott's obsession with our civil rights organization, his publicity stunt masquerading as a proclamation has no basis in fact or law. By defaming a prominent American Muslim institution with debunked conspiracy theories and made-up quotes, Mr. Abbott has once again shown that his top priority is advancing anti-Muslim bigotry, not serving the people of Texas,"" it added. ""The truth is that Mr. Abbott is an Israel First politician who has spent months stoking anti-Muslim hysteria to smear American Muslims critical of the Israeli government."" CAIR also said, ""We have successfully sued Greg Abbott three different times for shredding the First Amendment for the benefit of the Israeli government, and we are ready to do so again if he attempts to turn this publicity stunt into actual policy."" On Thursday, the CAIR Legal Defense Fund and the Muslim Legal Fund of America ""announced that they have filed a federal lawsuit against Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton to block enforcement of Abbott's ‘unconstitutional and defamatory’ Nov. 18th proclamation, which falsely declared the Texas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations a ‘foreign terrorist organization’ and threatened various civil penalties against the civil rights organization if it continues to serve the people of Texas."" ""CAIR-Texas and the Texas Muslim community are standing up for our constitutional rights by directly confronting Greg Abbott's lawless attack on our civil rights. We are not and will not be intimidated by smear campaigns launched by Israel First politicians like Mr. Abbott,"" CAIR-Texas said. Mr. Abbott is defaming us and other American Muslims because we are effective advocates for justice here and abroad.

"Soybean farmers, caught in the middle of a trade war between the world’s two biggest superpowers, are starting to feel the consequences as China uses its crop purchasing power as political leverage. As China’s economy has improved, the country has sought out more growth-boosting, high-protein soybean to feed its growing number of livestock such as pork and poultry. As the world’s biggest soybean buyer, China last year bought $12.6 billion worth of soybean from the U.S.—accounting for more than half of America’s total exports of the crop, which is its biggest agricultural export. Yet, this year the Trump Administration’s trade war with China has changed up its soybean calculus. The world’s second biggest economy usually commits to buying U.S. soybean as early as September at the start of the fall harvest. Thanks in part to tensions with the U.S. and increased tariffs, though, China did not commit, from May until the end of October, to any U.S. soybean purchases, partly relying instead on South American imports, especially from Brazil. China in recent years has also built up its own soybean production, adding about 9 million acres of the crop and increasing its production by 8.6 million metric tons since 2015, according to the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. As a result, American farmers have faced an undue strain. Caleb Ragland, a ninth-generation farmer from Kentucky and president of the American Soybean Association, said during a congressional hearing in October that the price of farm production, including land costs, seed, and fertilizer, have skyrocketed while agriculture margins continue to fall. “For soybean farmers, the loss of our largest export market due to trade retaliation by China has made financial problems even worse,” Ragland said. “High production cost and market losses mean soybean farmers are expected to face a loss of around $109 an acre for this year’s crop.” China ultimately committed to buying 12 million metric tons of soybean, down from 22.5 million tons in the prior season, ahead of President Donald Trump’s meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping in South Korea late last month. Trump has also promised $12 billion in aid for the affected soybean farmers, which, as a group, were one of his strongest supporters in his return to the White House last year. Yet, some farmers like Scott Gaffner, an an at-large director of the Illinois Soybean Association, say President Trump’s bailout isn’t enough. While China has committed to buying 25 million metric tons of soybean for the next three years, U.S. soybeans still face a 13% import tariff imposed by China, making them less appealing than competing supply from South America. In recent years, China has started shifting its buying to Brazil. China imported 71% of its soybeans from Brazil as of 2024, compared to 2% in the late ‘90s, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Gaffner said any further change in China’s soybean buying habits could cause farmers problems for years to come. “If China starts buying elsewhere, which they are doing now, once they establish those trade routes, it becomes more difficult for them to come back to the U.S. and buy their commodities,” Gaffner toldCBS. “Once we lose that, we may never get it back again. And that’s huge.”",right
"Charting the Global Economy: Disparity Tests a Resilient Europe Euro-area economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter, yet activity in nearly half the bloc is stagnating at best and tempering optimism of a broader recovery. (Bloomberg) — Euro-area economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter, yet activity in nearly half the bloc is stagnating at best and tempering optimism of a broader recovery. The disparity hasn’t escaped those at the European Central Bank. Concerns were raised at the ECB’s September meeting that economic resilience was largely due to healthy expansion in Spain, and that others weren’t doing well. With the end of the longest government shutdown in the US, investors and policymakers now await announcements from statistical agencies on updated schedules for economic data. Private-sector reports have shown the job market remains soft while consumer anxiety builds. Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy, markets and geopolitics: Europe Third-quarter output in the euro zone rose 0.2% from the previous three months. At the same time, countries representing 49% of the currency union’s gross domestic product failed to record any expansion at all during the period, with Germany — the continent’s biggest economy — joining Italy in stagnating. UK economic growth nearly ground to a halt in the third quarter after September’s activity was hit by a cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover and the fear of looming tax hikes in the Labour government’s upcoming budget. Gross domestic product rose just 0.1% compared with 0.3% in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said Norway’s underlying inflation rate surprised by jumping to the highest level in seven months, threatening to derail a plan by the nation’s central bank to stick to easing through 2028. Underlying consumer-price growth excluding energy rose to 3.4% in October, led by price gains for furniture, electronics and food. US Democrats trounced Trump’s Republicans last week in elections where cost-of-living anxieties loomed large. To be sure, analysts caution against reading too much into off-year ballots, and many Trump policies have yet to fully kick in. For now, with the job market cooling, consumer surveys and political polls find that Americans are downbeat about the economy and the president’s handling of it. US import volumes are projected to slow through the year-end holidays and into 2026, as tariff uncertainty weighs on cargo owners and the outlook for consumer spending remains clouded. Still, tariff mitigation efforts by retailers earlier in the year may have spared Americans major disruptions like shortages and price spikes during the holiday shopping season, according to the National Retail Federation. More Americans than ever are falling behind on their car payments. The share of subprime borrowers at least 60 days past due on their auto loans rose to 6.65% in October, the highest in data going back to 1994, according to Fitch Ratings. Asia China’s collapsing investment is as unprecedented as it is hard to explain. A plunge estimated at more than 11% in October from a year earlier was the worst single-month performance since the initial Covid lockdowns at the start of 2020. A further crash in investment could prove destabilizing by affecting an activity that makes up nearly half of China’s gross domestic product. Yet economists are still struggling to square the unprecedented contraction with other statistics or to fully decipher its cause. Gold is a traditional hedge against inflation for investors, but in China, surging bullion prices are having the opposite effect, providing a temporary respite from deflationary pressures. Core inflation last month saw its fastest increase in almost two years, with the precious metal contributing close to half or more of the 1.2% jump, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co. India’s inflation rate fell to a record low in October, driven by a sharp drop in food prices, prompting economists to predict more aggressive interest rate cuts. Emerging Markets Heading into Sunday’s elections, right-wing candidates vying to become Chile’s next president are falling over each other to show voters who’ll do more to stop migrants from slipping across the border. Yet as the population rapidly ages and the birth rate sinks below Japan’s, Chile risks going too far by locking out desperately needed foreign workers. South Africa’s finance minister adopted a 3% inflation target, giving political backing to the central bank which lobbied for the change, while cautioning that debt will now peak at a slightly higher level. World Uganda, Romania, Mauritius, Serbia and Peru kept interest rates unchanged, while Zambia lowered borrowing costs for the first time in five years. Mozambique also cut rates. More luxury homes were sold in Dubai in recent quarters than any other city, including New York or London, real estate consultancy Knight Frank estimates. The surge in purchases recalls the emirate’s pre-2009 boom that was eventually upended by a sharp downturn in the so-called off-plan market, where homes are sold ahead of construction. —With assistance from Irina Anghel, S’thembile Cele, Laura Curtis, Lauren Dezenski, Zainab Fattah, Josyana Joshua, John Liu, Yujing Liu, Matthew Malinowski, Mark Niquette, Andrew Rosati, Anup Roy, Zoe Schneeweiss, Mark Schroers, Ntando Thukwana, Ott Ummelas and Alexander Weber.

"When examining the flow of wealth in the coming decades, privately wealthy individuals rest in a very healthy position. Their assets have increased in value, their portfolios have performed well, and many are looking to the generations above them for a significant windfall of cash set to come from inheritance. Governments, with their eye-watering debt burdens and expensive borrowing costs, are eyeing that wealth—and they want in. Policymakers have leveraged private wealth in the past to pay their way, UBS chief economist Paul Donovan recently told media at a roundtable discussing the economic outlook for 2026—but the question is whether they will use a carrot or a stick to drum up revenue from individuals. As such, some may prove more popular than others. Donovan said last week: “Governments have long mobilized private wealth to support public finances. There are several approaches. One is to influence market behavior—encouraging individuals to buy government bonds through incentives like tax-free premium bonds, which channel savings directly into state financing. Prudential regulation can also steer pension funds toward domestic government debt, as seen in the UK after 1945, when a debt-to-GDP ratio of 240% was successfully reduced over decades.” It is this debt-to-GDP ratio that has economists so concerned, rather than the volume of debt itself. After all, the ratio is a useful indicator of whether an economy is growing fast enough to generate the revenues necessary to repay its debts—or the interest payments on its debts—to lenders. If the customers buying a government’s debt feel the ratio is unbalanced, they may demand higher interest to offset the risk and so push the government’s budget even further. To increase the supply of debt buyers—with individuals motivated by a tax-free incentive, for example—allows governments to borrow more without facing higher market interest. However, there are other, less popular ways to raise revenue to pay off the debt. “More contentious options exist,” added Donovan, “Such as taxing wealth through capital gains or inheritance levies. In practice, the initial focus tends to be on financial repression—using tax incentives or regulation to direct money into government bonds—before moving toward wealth taxation.” A timely wealth transfer Inheritance levies will be of significant interest in the era of the Great Wealth Transfer, with $80 trillion due to change hands over the next 20 years, according to UBS. Some studies put that figure even higher, saying as much as $124 trillion will be passed down from older generations to their younger counterparts. Donovan has previously warned that politicians will likely be wondering how this shift could help revive their own fortunes. The chief economist said in a video last month: “It seems unrealistic to suppose that governments will just sit idly by as this wealth moves around. We would expect governments to attempt to mobilize that wealth to help fund their debt, but in doing so, that denies private sector investment access to some of those funds.” With global public debt now surpassing $100 trillion, politicians and the public alike are growing increasingly concerned about the issue. While economists have described President Trump’s methods as “peculiar,” there is no doubt that his tariff regime has brought billions to Uncle Sam’s bottom line. The White House has also suggested selling “gold cards” to wealthy would-be immigrants, with Trump saying it would be “nice” to offset some of the debt with the proceeds. That being said, this idea was tabled in February with more details promised to emerge within the fortnight—no such small print has been confirmed. The U.K.’s Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has adopted a different approach—potentially more in line with the policies Donovan has suggested. In a pre-budget speech a few weeks ago, Reeves made it clear that individuals will be called on to play their part in the wider fiscal trajectory. “If we are to build the future of Britain together, we will all have to contribute to that effort,” she said. “Each of us must do our bit for the security of our country and the brightness of its future. There is a reward for getting these decisions right, to build more resilient public finances—with the headroom to withstand global turbulence.”",right
"India, Canada deepen energy, mineral ties amid U.S. tariffs The two nations will also widen aerospace investment and trading opportunities India and Canada will work together to secure supply chains in critical minerals and clean energy, according to a joint statement, signalling a reset in bilateral ties amid trade tensions driven by U.S. policies. The two nations will also deepen engagement to widen investment and trading opportunities in the aerospace sector, the statement issued Friday said. Relations between the two countries have been rocky since 2023, when then-prime minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused India of killing a Sikh separatist leader outside a temple in Surrey, B.C. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government denied involvement and blamed Canada for harbouring Sikh separatist groups, resulting in a pause in trade talks. However, United States President Donald Trump’s trade policies have pushed the nations to revisit their positions as countries across the globe scramble to diversify supply chains and find new markets to shield their economies from Washington’s tariff onslaught. Trump singled out India for purchasing Russian oil and imposed a crushing tariff of 50 per cent that hit more than half of Indian exports to the U.S. The U.S. halted all trade talks with Canada in late October over a Canadian advertisement against Trump’s tariff policy. After Mark Carney became Canada’s prime minister, the two countries have taken a series of steps in repairing ties, including restoring their envoys and seeking to establish a information-sharing framework to curb cross-border crime. Earlier this week, Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met his counterpart, Anita Anand, in Ontario while Canadian Trade Minister Maninder Sidhu is visiting India. Bilateral trade in goods and services stood at US$23.66 billion in 2024, with merchandise trade valued at nearly US$8.98 billion, a substantial 10 per cent increase over the previous year, according to the statement.

"Stocks Get Late-Day Boost on Shutdown-Deal Hopes: Markets Wrap Wall Street saw a sharp bounce from session lows amid hopes that US lawmakers are getting closer to a deal ending the longest shutdown in American history. Crypto trimmed this week’s plunge. (Bloomberg) — Wall Street saw a sharp bounce from session lows amid hopes that US lawmakers are getting closer to a deal ending the longest shutdown in American history. Crypto trimmed this week’s plunge. Equities wiped out losses, with nearly 400 shares in the S&P 500 rising. While Senate Republicans rejected Democrats’ proposal to scale back their demands to a one-year extension of expiring health-care subsidies, the fact that the parties were trading offers was seen as a positive step. The Nasdaq 100 pared most of its Friday’s slide, but posted its worst week since April. Subscribe to the Stock Movers Podcast on Apple, Spotify and other Podcast Platforms. As federal agencies publishing economic data went dark, the US payrolls report was not released on Friday. A survey conducted by 22V Research showed that a labor-market unwind is the biggest risk to trading, which explains why risk assets and bond yields have been so sensitive to any news on that front. US consumer sentiment tumbled to near the lowest on record as the government shutdown weighed on the economic outlook and high prices soured views about personal finances. “The government shutdown creates further risk because the longer it continues, the more its impact will be felt on Main Street,” said David Russell at TradeStation. That’s all unfolding at a time when worries about artificial-intelligence winners reaching unsustainable levels hit the market after a torrid surge. “This week’s dip looks more like a purge of froth than a crack in the fundamentals, along with a reality check for the AI momentum trade stretched against growth worries and lofty valuations,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. The S&P 500 rose 0.1%, bouncing after an earlier test of its 50-day moving average. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.09%. The dollar dropped 0.2%. Bitcoin climbed about 2.5%. “Even if reports of incremental progress being made to turn the lights back on in Washington yield a deal, the data distortions will linger for the foreseeable future,” said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets. The US stock market could see deeper losses should the government shutdown last another week or longer, the latest Markets Pulse survey showed. The equity benchmark will end its string of record highs for now should the federal closure last another one to two weeks, according to 14% of 121 respondents in a survey conducted Nov. 5-7. A fifth of participants said more pain will come if it runs longer than two weeks, while 35% said it would take another month. Some 22% said the stock gauge has already exhausted gains after its rebound since April. “We expect some progress towards reopening the government,” said TD Securities strategists. “While the exact timing remains unclear, Thanksgiving travel is a likely backstop. Due to staffing shortages, the FAA is reducing air traffic, with US airlines beginning to cancel flights. Meanwhile, data collection issues are a growing concern during the shutdown.” “While there is no jobs report Friday due to the government shutdown, there is enough private payroll and layoff data to suggest that the labor market is cooling,” said Glen Smith at GDS Wealth Management. “This cooling keeps the Fed’s rate cut plans alive for December and potentially into early 2026.” The economy remains on an upward trajectory even if economic growth slows toward trend levels in 2026, according to Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management. “The bigger concern — and the key focus of the Fed’s debate — will be the health of the labor market,” she said. “The Fed will continue to implement rate cuts to prevent any weakness in employment from accelerating. Much of the market’s optimism hinges on the assumption that policymakers will maintain some level of support.” BlackRock Inc. executive Rick Rieder, who is among those being considered to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, said the labor market is softening and interest rates should be lowered to 3%. “We have a softening of the labor market that is quite significant,” Rieder told Bloomberg Television. “If we had the number today, I think it would have been reflective thereof.” Read: When Fed Gets Jobs Data, It Won’t Make December Rate Call Easier In recent weeks, Target Corp. announced plans to eliminate 1,800 roles, or about 8% of corporate jobs in its first major restructuring in years. Amazon.com Inc. said it would slash 14,000 corporate jobs — following a warning from its CEO that AI will shrink the company’s workforce — while Paramount Skydance Corp. axed 1,000 workers. Other companies cutting corporate jobs include Starbucks Corp., Delta Air Lines Inc., CarMax Inc., Rivian Automotive Inc. and Molson Coors Beverage Co. The government shutdown has reduced visibility around labor-market conditions at a time when Fed officials have become more divided over the next appropriate policy step, noted Jennifer Timmerman at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “We see a wide range of factors contributing to slowing job growth. Among them: moderating economic activity, a general unwind of pandemic-era labor hoarding, lingering tariff uncertainty, worker shortages in immigration-dependent industries, and federal cost cuts in the government sector,” she said. Still, Timmerman believes that the available data remain consistent with her firm’s constructive economic outlook for 2026 from a soft patch at the turn of the year. “We look for policy-related tailwinds already in the pipeline — including tax cuts, monetary stimulus, and deregulation — to spur a reacceleration of economic growth beyond the early part of next year,” she concluded. Fed officials had to make their latest interest-rate decision without key economic statistics thanks to the US government shutdown. The data they will receive when the government reopens probably won’t make the next decision any easier. With each day passing, there’s an increasing chance some October data on jobs and prices may not be released at all. The uncertainty will prolong a debate among Fed officials about whether the labor market is really weakening fast enough to warrant another rate cut in December amid ongoing inflation risks — a question over which they’re already split. “With the labor market softening in some areas, we expect the Fed to cut interest rates at their December meeting,” said Chris Senyek at Wolfe Research. “As the US government shutdown continues, once it reopens, we see a negative payrolls print as a key risk for markets over the coming months.” While not his base case, in this scenario, Senyek expects markets to view the Fed as “behind the curve”, especially if the central bank decides to hold rates steady in December. “The labor market’s cushion is getting thinner. And a thinner labor cushion means: Slower consumer spending, more pressure on consumer credit, higher sensitivity to tight financial conditions, and earnings multiple expansion get harder to justify,” said Kenny Polcari at SlateStone Wealth. For Wall Street, this means that if the labor market begins showing real cracks, the multiple expansion story for growth stocks becomes a lot more vulnerable, he said. “In short: good earnings alone won’t carry the market if investor confidence in the labor market wanes,” he concluded. Despite the the anxiety that roiled riskier assets in recent days, flows remain supportive for stocks. US equity funds had an eighth consecutive week of inflows, the longest streak this year, but cash attracted the bulk of inflows, Bank of America Corp. said citing EPFR Global data. “Investors should prioritize good risk/reward setups, potentially after a healthy pullback within this bull market,” said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler. Traders are pondering a moment of weakness embedded in a multi-month rip higher for stocks, yet the market on balance looks poised for further gains, said Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Tony Pasquariello. “I’m not saying that risk/reward is overly compelling, nor that this is an ideal location to add a bunch of incremental risk,” he said this week. “Looking forward, I’d argue the balance of risks still points in favor of the bulls.” With the S&P 500 testing its 50-day moving average, the set-up is for a bounce here into next week, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott. “However, be careful because the most recent series of new all-time highs were each met with lower highs in momentum,” he noted. “This suggests that buying power was waning into the September-October, which can likely precede reversals both major and minor in scope.” At this time, he’s still watching for a correction within the magnitude of 5% to 10% before the year is over. “The ace in the hole here is the strong earnings season,” said Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates. There is a distinct possibility that we will look back at the current S&P 500 value “as a true buying opportunity before year-end.” Corporate Highlights: - US officials warned that the number of flight cancellations may need to double if the government shutdown drags out and air-traffic controller staffing shortages worsen, potentially escalating travel disruptions as the country heads into one of its busiest travel seasons. - Apple Inc.’s streaming service went down briefly for some users Thursday night shortly after the debut of the widely anticipated Pluribus, a new series from the creator of Breaking Bad. - Tesla Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said he expects China to fully approve the carmaker’s advanced driver-assistance capabilities that are similar to those marketed as Full Self-Driving in the US. - A group of about 20 banks is providing a roughly $18 billion project finance loan to help fund the construction of a data center campus tied to Oracle Corp., marking the latest mega debt deal to help bankroll the artificial intelligence boom. - Boeing Co. is plowing more than $1 billion into its 787 Dreamliner factory complex in South Carolina, aiming to double monthly production as sales surge for its advanced widebody jet. - KKR & Co. disclosed that it will take a charge to pay back fees on an Asia private equity fund after it underperformed, sending the company’s shares slumping Friday despite quarterly earnings that beat expectations. - PNC Financial Services Group Inc. lifted its planned investment in branches once more as the bank chases deposits in the fastest-growing US markets. - Comcast Corp., owner of the European pay-television service Sky, is in talks to buy ITV Plc’s media and entertainment arm in a deal that would dramatically shake up the UK broadcasting landscape. - Constellation Energy Corp., the biggest US nuclear-plant owner, has been hinting for months about building new reactors — and investors are starting to show signs of impatience. - First Brands Group won access to $600 million of remaining bankruptcy financing, which company lawyers said was needed to prevent the company from immediately shutting down. - Sweetgreen Inc. cut its full-year outlook after third-quarter results unexpectedly worsened, with the salad chain citing stubbornly weak demand. - Six Flags Entertainment Corp. cut its outlook for a second time this year and took a $1.5 billion charge on its third-quarter results after overestimating the performance of its parks. - Wendy’s Co. sales beat estimates by declining less than expected in the third quarter, the latest example of fast food outpeforming as cash-strapped consumers cut back on spending. - Intellia Therapeutics Inc. shares dropped after the company said a patient died after suffering liver damage in a clinical trial for the company’s gene-editing treatment. - A little-known Cigna Group subsidiary that sells generic drugs charges prices that skew higher than many competing suppliers, according to a new analysis that raises questions about the company’s role in setting medication prices. - Brookfield Asset Management said its third-quarter earnings reached an all-time high amid record fundraising and deployment of capital, particularly within its infrastructure, transition and credit businesses. - British Airways parent IAG SA said its all-important North Atlantic route experienced some weakness in the third quarter, weighing on earnings that missed estimates and causing the stock to drop the most since April. - Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA posted better-than-expected profit in the third quarter in a boost to Chief Executive Officer Luigi Lovaglio following the takeover of rival Mediobanca SpA. - Cellnex Telecom SA plans to spend as much as €500 million ($576 million) on share buybacks by the end of next year, boosting its previous pledge by €200 million as it seeks to make the stock more attractive to investors. - China is allowing Dutch chipmaker Nexperia to export again from its operations in the country, setting the stage for the Netherlands to back down and suspend its powers over the Chinese-owned company. - Olympus Corp.’s new Chief Executive Officer Bob White is shaking up the Tokyo-based medical devices maker after a difficult period that included the ouster of his predecessor in a drug scandal.

"Costco is joining other companies that aren’t waiting to see whether the Supreme Court strikes down President Donald Trump’s most sweeping import taxes. They’re going to court to demand refunds on the tariffs they’ve paid. The U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington ruled earlier this year that Trump’s biggest and boldest import taxes are illegal. The case is now before the Supreme Court. In a Nov. 5 hearing, several of the high court’s justices expressed doubts that the president had sweeping power to declare national emergencies to impose tariffs on goods from almost every country on earth. If the court strikes down the tariffs, importers may be entitled to refunds on the levies they’ve paid. “It’s uncertain whether refunds will be granted and, if so, how much,” said Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. ”But the possibility has prompted many companies — including Costco — to file actions in the U.S. Court of International Trade to get in line, so to speak, for potential refunds.” In a complaint filed last week with the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York, Costco said it is demanding the money back now “to ensure that its right to a complete refund is not jeopardized.″ The operator of warehouse-sized stores expressed concern that it could not get a refund once the tariff bills have have gone through liquidation by Customs and Border Protection, a process Costco says will start Dec. 15. Revlon and canned seafood and chicken producer Bumble Bee Foods have made similar arguments in the trade court. The tariffs facing the court challenged have raised around $90 billion so far. Trump warned back in August that the loss of his tariffs would destroy that American economy and lead to “1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION!”",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format Is Trump Sending Checks to Americans in 2025 On Sunday, Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social, “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” adding, “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” as quoted by CNN.$2000 Payment Proposal Tied to Tariff Revenue, Not Taxes While this isn’t the first time Trump has suggested giving Americans a share of tariff money. Back in August, he said Americans could receive a portion of the revenue generated from tariffs, saying, “We’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America,” as quoted in the report.Although importers technically pay the tariffs, many pass those costs on to consumers, meaning Americans indirectly bear part of the burden, as per the CNN report.

He said there were no formal proposals yet and that Trump’s mention of $2,000 payments “could come in lots of forms,” such as offsets for taxes on tips, overtime, or Social Security income, as reported by CNN.The US Treasury has collected more than $220 billion in tariff revenue under the Trump administration, including tariffs that existed before his term began, as per the report. With more than 163 million Americans filing tax returns in 2024, $2,000 payments for each would cost about $326 billion, well above total tariff revenue collected, as per CNN.

"Rep. Thomas Massie — a Republican fiscal hawk facing a President Donald Trump-backed primary challenger in Kentucky — has previously described himself as ""America First,"" but now he says he thinks that he's ""America only."" ""I am tired of sending money overseas,"" he told Fox News Digital during an interview on Thursday. ""I am tired of favoring foreign beef over U.S.A.-grown beef,"" he continued. ""I'm ready to be America only. And I think all congressmen should be that way."" Massie gave Trump a mixed review, saying that the president is America First on ""some"" fronts. REP THOMAS MASSIE REMARRIES AFTER WIFE'S DEATH LAST YEAR: ‘PLEASE PRAY FOR US’ ""But when it comes to the beef, he is not America first. When it comes to sending money overseas to Ukraine and Israel,"" Massie said, ""I think he needs to get back to his campaign promises and put America first. Because we're not gonna make America great again by sending our money overseas."" Massie noted that his ""biggest disagreement"" with both the Trump administration and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is the increase in spending. ""I mean, I thought we were conservatives. Why are we spending more this year than Joe Biden spent in his last year? Actually, we're spending about $200 billion dollars more,"" he said, adding that the consequence ""is inflation and higher interest rates."" ""And people are feeling that. You can't gaslight them,"" Massie added. ""You can't tell them that things are getting cheaper when they're not getting cheaper."" In a statement to Fox News Digital, White House spokesman Kush Desai accused Massie of ""Fake Math."" TRUMP SAYS MASSIE IS ‘GONNA BE HISTORY’ AS ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ JUMPS FINAL HURDLES TO PASSAGE ""Here are the facts: President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cut Act cut mandatory spending by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, and the budget deficit from April to September of this year is down a staggering 40% compared to last year, when Joe Biden was president,"" Desai declared in the statement. ""Instead of Fake Math, Thomas Massie should reflect on how he betrayed his voters and hardworking Americans when he voted with every Democrat against the biggest tax cut for working families in American history, including no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime pay, increased child tax credits, and permanence for the 2017 Trump Tax Cuts,"" he added. Massie said his other disagreements with what has been happening in D.C. are ""secondary"" to the spending issue. ""I would say, we need to follow through on some of our campaign promises. For instance, release the Epstein files,"" he said. MAVERICK HOUSE REPUBLICAN IN TRUMP'S CROSSHAIRS TOUTS RECORD CAMPAIGN CASH HAUL Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have been spearheading a bid to force a House vote on a proposal that would compel the release of materials pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein. Their discharge petition has amassed 217 of the 218 signatures needed to force the vote, but Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, who has said she will sign on, has still not yet been sworn in to office more than six weeks after winning a special election in Arizona. Johnson ""has tried every which way he can to avoid this vote,"" Massie claimed, asserting that the speaker has not sworn in the Democrat because she ""represents the 218th signature I need to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files."" Fox News Digital reached out to Johnson's office for comment. RAND PAUL PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR MASSIE AGAINST TRUMP-BACKED CHALLENGER: ‘I’M GOING TO HELP HIM' Massie, who owns cattle himself, said the president has ""sort of gut punched the cattle ranchers and … livestock farmers"" in the U.S. During remarks aboard Air Force One last month, Trump indicated the U.S. was considering buying beef from Argentina to drive prices down. Days later Reuters reported that a White House official indicated that the administration was quadrupling the nation's low-tariff imports of beef from the South American nation. Increasing the tariff rate quota to 80,000 metric tons will allow Argentina to send greater quantities of the product to America at a lower rate of duty, according to the outlet. The president has Massie in his political crosshairs — he has repeatedly reviled the congressman on Truth Social. In a post on Monday, Trump referred to Massie as ""a Weak and Pathetic RINO"" — a pejorative acronym that stands for ""Republican in name only."" He also called the congressman ""a totally ineffective LOSER,"" while expressing his support for primary challenger Ed Gallrein, who Trump is backing in the race. SCOOP: TRUMP-BACKED FORMER NAVY SEAL LAUNCHES GOP PRIMARY CHALLENGE AGAINST MASSIE Even as the president tries to convince voters in Kentucky's 4th Congressional District to reject Massie, the lawmaker said that he does not regret endorsing Trump ahead of the 2024 election, noting that former Vice President Kamala Harris would have been a total ""disaster."" Massie initially backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primary, but DeSantis dropped out and backed Trump, and Massie later endorsed the Republican juggernaut as well. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""And I'm glad that President Trump won,"" he said. Trump has ""done a lot of good things,"" he said, adding that many of them have been carried out via executive order, and he thinks Congress should vote on more of the issues so that the president's moves are not simply ""temporary actions."" Asked whether he'd have any interest in potentially running for president himself, Massie said that he is not interested.",right
"Homeownership has long been part of the American dream, but that dream has been deferred. Households in their 30s have an ownership rate of just 42% — more than 20 points lower than the national average. The median age of all home buyers is a record-breaking 59, and the age of a first-time buyer is 40 — up from 29 in 1981. THE TOP 3 REASONS HOUSING HAS BECOME SO UNAFFORDABLE IN THE US MARKET – AND IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK As a solution, the Trump administration is floating a 50-year mortgage. Though I disagree with that specific idea, I am heartened that they are brainstorming ways to tackle the problem. We need a Marshall Plan for housing, a collection of broad initiatives to make homes more affordable and put the dream back on track. The federal government can use its bully pulpit to get changes to red tape and regulations that are holding back building, and encourage policies that would increase housing and decrease costs. To start, the White House and Fannie Mae should instead promote shorter, 20-year mortgages. As Ed Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute has argued, a 20-year loan can be paid off ""when the 30-year-term loan leaves most homeowners saddled with another decade or more of mortgage payments, the cash flow freed up from a paid-off shorter-term loan is available to fund a child’s post-secondary-education needs and later turbocharge one’s own retirement."" The 20-year loan could be incentivized with a first-time buyer tax credit. The decline in homeownership is a problem that must be addressed federally and locally. This would be especially important today when the vast majority of taxpayers no longer itemize their tax returns — which means they cannot avail themselves of the deduction for mortgage interest. That deduction always favored wealthy buyers of high-end homes anyway — so a targeted tax credit would help those who actually need it far more. It’s time, as well, for the Trump White House to roll back one of the key initiatives of Elizabeth Warren’s pet project, the Consumer Protection Financial Agency. The CPFC has pressured banks to limit mortgages to ""plain vanilla"" mortgages, premised on its rules or what consumers can afford. TRUMP'S 50-YEAR MORTGAGE MAY BURDEN AMERICANS WITH MORE DEBT, EXPERTS SAY Adjustable rate loans and other ""mortgage products"" can be right for some buyers — who should have a choice of how much risk they want to take in exchange for getting into the home market. Even a low down payment might be hard to come up with, however, for those who can’t take advantage of generous in-laws. Those without rich parents might turn to a ""housing saving account"" — akin to the popular health savings accounts initiated by George W. Bush and which hold some $59 billion and are sheltered from taxation. The new housing accounts should be tailored only for down payments, however — not long-term maintenance and other homeowner needs. Buyers also are allowed today to take out $10,000 from their 401(k) penalty-free to go to a downpayment on a home. Perhaps it’s time to raise that ceiling. Of course, it goes almost without saying that even the most creative financing and incentives will fall short of addressing our housing needs without the most important problem: Supply. There are many reasons why there aren’t enough starter homes. Regulation in many cities makes construction difficult. More retiring Boomers own second homes. TRUMP’S 50-YEAR MORTGAGE JUST INTRODUCES A NEW KIND OF DEBT Banks have increasingly bought real estate as an investment and drive up prices. Low turnover is another reason Gen X buyers have so much trouble breaking into the market. During COVID, mortgage rates hit record lows and many refinanced. These owners have a strong incentive not to trade a 3% mortgage for a new home and a much-higher rate. Another key reason: more and more of us are living in small households or even alone. The Census Bureau reports that, between 2019 and 2021, the number of households increased by more than 2 million a year. That means we not only need more housing but more types of housing — many smaller units especially, rather than the two-acre, one house lots common in so many suburbs. Here is where the limits of Washington’s hard power is reached. Much of US housing policy is set at the hyper-local level, by planning boards and zoning boards. That’s why outgoing New York City Mayor Eric Adams deserves so much credit for his ""City of Yes"" rezoning in New York, which will permit safe basement apartments and ""accessory dwelling units"" in parts of the city. Accessory units — or ‘granny flats"" — can also be the means for older couples to sell the homes to younger households and downsize. As part of a federal push, though, the Marshall Plan for Housing could encourage these same changes nationwide: Changing zoning to allow more housing; or taking undeveloped state land and providing tax incentives to build on them. It’s the 18,000 municipalities across the country that are often standing in the way of what might be called naturally occurring affordable housing — small homes on small lots, like those of the original Levittown, where houses were just 750 square feet of living space. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner should urge localities to permit private, unsubsidized, small homes and apartment buildings, or what AEI’s Pinto terms ""light-touch density."" It’s far more likely to gain local approval than the subsidized, low-income housing Democrats have long favored, starting with the public housing the socialist Zohran Mamdani wants to revive. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Private building is also less costly; new housing units in California subsidized through the low income housing tax credit can cost upwards of $800,000 per units, a bonanza for developers but not many tenants. Building costs for any housing, however, will inevitably go up as a result of another Trump policy: his 10% tariff on plentiful Canadian lumber and timber products and a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinets and furniture. The de facto taxes are causing what the National Association of Home Builders calls ""headwinds"" holding back new construction. As a builder himself, he should rethink these tariffs. Homeownership is a virtuous conspiracy making the nation better. Owners are more likely to maintain neighborhoods than renters, more likely to improve schools and services by getting involved in local government — the essence of American federalism. The decline in homeownership is a problem that must be addressed federally and locally.

"As President Donald Trump warns of ""zero tolerance"" for narco-states in America’s backyard, China is tightening its grip on Venezuela — a high-risk economic and political bet that could soon collide with U.S. power. U.S. defense officials confirmed to Reuters last month that a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group had entered the Southern Command region, which covers the Caribbean and the northern coast of South America, to monitor narcotrafficking routes linked to Venezuela’s military leadership. The Pentagon said the arrival of USS Gerald R. Ford, carrying more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of tactical aircraft, would ""bolster US capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities."" It added that the mission aims to ""degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organizations."" CHINA CONDEMNS US MILITARY BUILDUP OFF VENEZUELA COAST AS FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN REGIONAL AFFAIRS Within weeks, Venezuelan officers were reportedly training for guerrilla-style defense against a possible U.S. strike — an acknowledgment, according to Reuters, of ""rising anxiety inside Caracas."" Into this standoff, Beijing unveiled a ""zero-tariff"" trade agreement with Caracas at the Shanghai Expo 2025, announced by Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade Coromoto Godoy. Venezuelan officials said the accord covers roughly 400 tariff categories, removing duties on Chinese and Venezuelan goods. While final implementation details remain pending verification, the goal is clear: Beijing is moving fast into a sanctioned economy that Washington has sought to isolate. ""This really looks like China is going to completely take over the Venezuelan economy,"" said Gordon Chang, an expert on China’s global trade strategy. ""It’s going to decimate Venezuela’s local industry."" ""Venezuela basically sells petroleum to China and very little else,"" he said. ""China, of course, is a manufacturer of many, many items. Venezuelan manufacturing is not going to experience a renaissance anytime soon — it’s going the opposite direction."" VENEZUELA MOBILIZES TROOPS, WEAPONS IN RESPONSE TO US WARSHIP BUILDUP IN CARIBBEAN Chang added that Maduro’s sudden embrace of Beijing stems from fear of Trump’s next move. ""Maduro probably doesn’t have a choice,"" he said. ""He realizes he’s got a problem in the form of Donald J. Trump. There’s a U.S. aircraft carrier not far from his shores, and a lot of military assets bearing down on him. He needs a friend, and he’s desperate."" ""For Maduro, the zero-tariff pact may offer temporary relief — but it only deepens dependence,"" Chang added. ""I don’t see this trade deal as strengthening Venezuela. I see it strengthening China’s stranglehold over Venezuela."" US MILITARY BUILDUP IN CARIBBEAN SEES BOMBERS, MARINES AND WARSHIPS CONVERGE NEAR VENEZUELA From Beijing’s perspective, the tariff-free pact opens a commercial and strategic doorway into the Western Hemisphere just as Washington doubles down on sanctions. The Council on Foreign Relations estimates that China has extended around $60 billion in loans to Venezuela over the past two decades, much of it repaid through oil shipments — a figure still cited by both Chinese and Venezuelan officials in 2025. ""China has leveraged multibillion-dollar loans and the establishment of satellite positioning and surveillance facilities to secure strategic control over Venezuela’s natural resources and critical infrastructure,"" said Isaias Medina III, an Edward Mason Fellow at Harvard University and a former Venezuelan diplomat to the U.N. Security Council. Medina was referring to the El Sombrero satellite ground station in Venezuela’s Guárico province — a joint China-Venezuela project that Western analysts, including a recent Associated Press report, describe as part of a wider space cooperation network giving Beijing an intelligence foothold in Latin America. Medina said the new pact must be understood as one layer in a wider anti-Western alignment. ""Under the banner of so-called ‘21st Century Socialism,’ initiated by Hugo Chávez and expanded by Nicolás Maduro, the nation has evolved into a forward operating base for regimes openly hostile to the United States and its allies,"" he said. ""Iran, Russia, China, and Cuba have entrenched themselves across Venezuelan territory, using the country as a platform for asymmetric warfare, intelligence operations, and ideological expansion throughout Latin America."" He noted that ""Russia’s military footprint includes more than $12 billion in arms sales and ongoing defense cooperation and Wagner Group presence in military exercises,"" while Cuban military advisers remain embedded inside Venezuelan security institutions. ""Iran has exploited this environment to embed terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas, using Venezuela as both a financial hub and a logistical corridor. These activities extend to former training camps in Syria, where Venezuelan operatives and mercenaries have been indoctrinated in hybrid warfare tactics,"" he added. ""Iranian interest includes potential drone manufacturing and uranium mining."" ""The Maduro government, shielded by the absence of the rule of law or legitimate governance, has replaced statecraft with criminal enterprise,"" Medina said. ""Grand corruption is not the exception; it is the system."" ""The humanitarian toll is catastrophic,"" he added. ""Over 30% of Venezuela’s population has been forcibly displaced. Starvation has been weaponized as a tool of social control, amounting to a war crime under international law. Despite the enormity of these crimes, many United Nations member states continue to recognize and engage with this illegitimate regime, thereby perpetuating its impunity. The failure to confront this crisis decisively enables a coalition of adversaries, state and non-state actors alike, to project power dangerously close to U.S. territory."" For now, Washington’s sanctions campaign still constrains Venezuela’s oil lifelines. In March 2025, Reuters reported that U.S. threats to impose tariffs on nations buying Venezuelan crude caused a temporary disruption in shipments to China. Beijing dismissed the measures as ""illegal extraterritorial actions"" and vowed to continue cooperation — but has not disclosed how it will enforce the new tariff-free pact. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Chang said the underlying reality hasn’t changed: China can’t protect Caracas from U.S. hard power. ""It can certainly launch a propaganda blitz,"" he said, ""but it can’t project military force in the region. It’s really up to what President Trump does. China does not have the military strength to oppose American intervention if that’s what Trump decides."" Medina agreed that the stakes reach beyond economics. ""Just three hours from U.S. shores, this narco-terrorist regime has become the operational convergence of organized crime, drug trafficking, money laundering, and human rights atrocities,"" he said, urging a Western response combining ""diplomatic isolation, targeted sanctions, and, when necessary, defensive deployments.""",right

As a result of our strong third quarter performance and our fourth quarter expectations, we are increasing our full year 2025 sales and margin outlook.” Mr. Pagano continued, “We are also pleased to announce the acquisition of Haws Corporation, a leading global brand providing emergency safety and hydration solutions for use in industrial, institutional and non-residential end markets for more than 120 years. The addition of Haws’ innovative, specified products will enable us to offer our customers expanded capabilities and solutions. We welcome the Haws team to Watts and look forward to integrating Haws’ strong brand into our portfolio.” Mr. Pagano concluded, “We are confident in our ability to manage the fluid trade environment and believe that our differentiated portfolio as well as our resilient business strategy will drive sustainable, long-term growth. Our balance sheet is strong and well-positioned to support strategic investments in the business, return of capital to shareholders, and the execution of our strategy.” A summary of third quarter financial results is as follows: Third Quarter Ended | ||||||||| September 28, | September 29, | |||||||| (In millions, except per share information) | 2025 | 2024 | % Change | |||||| Net sales | $ | 611.7 | $ | 543.6 | 13 | % | ||| Organic sales growth % (1) | 9 | % | ||||||| Operating income | $ | 111.4 | $ | 93.2 | 20 | % | ||| Operating margin % | 18.2 | % | 17.1 | % | 110 | bps | ||| Adjusted operating income (1) | $ | 113.3 | $ | 92.8 | 22 | % | ||| Adjusted operating margin % (1) | 18.5 | % | 17.1 | % | 140 | bps | ||| Diluted earnings per share | $ | 2.45 | $ | 2.06 | 19 | % | ||| Special items (1) | 0.05 | (0.03) | ||||||| Adjusted diluted earnings per share (1) | $ | 2.50 | $ | 2.03 | 23 | % | | ____________________ | || (1) | Organic sales growth, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, special items and adjusted diluted earnings per share represent non-GAAP financial measures.

Organic sales increased due to favorable price, volume, and pull-forward demand in the Americas resulting from tariff-related price increases. Growth in the Americas was partly offset by continued market weakness in Europe. Incremental acquisition sales within the Americas were $11 million and contributed 2% to reported growth. Favorable foreign exchange movements increased sales by $6 million, or 1%. Operating margin increased 110 basis points on a reported basis and 140 basis points on an adjusted basis. Operating and adjusted operating margin increased primarily due to favorable price, volume leverage in the Americas, productivity, and cost actions which more than offset volume deleverage in Europe, inflation and tariffs. Sales of $464 million increased 16% on a reported basis and 13% on an organic basis, primarily due to favorable price, volume, and pull-forward demand. The acquisitions of I-CON and EasyWater contributed $11 million of incremental sales, or 3%, to reported growth. Segment margin increased 180 basis points as benefits from price realization, volume leverage, productivity, and cost actions more than offset inflation, tariffs, and investments. Sales of $112 million increased 4% on a reported basis and decreased 2% on an organic basis. Sales growth was due to favorable foreign exchange movements, which increased reported sales by 6%. Organic sales decreased as a result of lower volumes due to a decline in drains and continued market weakness, which more than offset favorable price realization. Segment margin increased 160 basis points as price, productivity, and restructuring actions more than offset volume deleverage and inflation. Sales of $36 million decreased 1% on a reported basis and were flat on an organic basis. Sales decreased due to unfavorable foreign exchange movements, which reduced reported sales by 1%. Organic sales were flat as growth in Australia and the Middle East was offset by declines in China and New Zealand. Segment margin increased 90 basis points as benefits from productivity and sales mix more than offset inflation. For the first nine months of 2025, operating cash flow was $247 million and net capital expenditures were $31 million, resulting in free cash flow of $216 million. In the comparable period last year, operating cash flow was $222 million and net capital expenditures were $17 million, resulting in free cash flow of $204 million. Operating and free cash flow increased due to higher net income and lower tax payments as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, partially offset by higher working capital investments related to the timing of accounts receivable collections and higher inventory costs primarily related to tariffs. Free cash flow was also unfavorably impacted by an increase in net capital expenditures, largely due to proceeds from the sale of properties in the prior year. The anticipated normal seasonality for the fourth quarter is expected to result in strong operating and free cash flow. The Company repurchased approximately 15,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $3.9 million during the third quarter of 2025. For the first nine months of 2025, the Company repurchased approximately 51,000 shares at a cost of $11.8 million. Approximately $133 million remains available under the stock repurchase program authorized in 2023. There is no expiration date for this program. The Company is increasing its full year sales and organic sales growth outlook as well as its operating margin and adjusted operating margin outlook. Reported sales are expected to increase between 7% to 8% and organic sales to increase between 4% and 5%. Full year operating margin is expected to be between 18.1% and 18.2%, or up 80 to 90 basis points, and adjusted operating margin is expected to be between 19.1% and 19.2%, or up 140 to 150 basis points. The full year outlook incorporates estimated tariff impacts and actions as of November 5, 2025, and the impact of the Haws acquisition. Further 2025 planning assumptions are included in the third quarter earnings materials posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.watts.com.

Segment earnings exclude the impact of non-recurring and unusual items, such as restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs, gain or loss on sale of assets and pension settlements. The CODM uses segment earnings for insight into underlying trends comparing past financial performance with current performance by reporting segment on a consistent basis. Segment margin is defined as segment earnings divided by segment revenue. We refer to non-GAAP financial measures (including adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, organic sales, organic sales growth, free cash flow, cash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income and net debt to capitalization ratio) and provide a reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding financial measures contained in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe these financial measures enhance the overall understanding of our historical financial performance and give insight into our future prospects. Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share eliminate certain expenses incurred and benefits recognized in the periods presented that relate primarily to our global restructuring programs, acquisition-related costs, gain or loss on sale of assets, pension settlements, other investment gains and the related income tax impacts on these items and tax adjustment items (with respect to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share only). Management then utilizes these adjusted financial measures to assess the run rate of the Company’s operations against those of comparable periods. Organic sales and organic sales growth are non-GAAP measures of net sales and net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures from period-over-period comparisons. Management believes reporting organic sales and organic sales growth provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, and allows for a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales and sales growth on a consistent basis. Free cash flow, cash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income, and the net debt to capitalization ratio, which are adjusted to exclude certain cash inflows and outlays, and include only certain balance sheet accounts from the comparable GAAP measures, are an indication of our performance in cash flow generation and also provide an indication of the Company’s relative balance sheet leverage to other industrial manufacturing companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating our cash flow generation and our capitalization structure. In addition, free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay certain compensation-based incentives. For these reasons, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures can be useful to investors, potential investors and others. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

"Listen to this article in summarized format Cutting through the noise surrounding India’s buzzing IPO market, he explains why Aviva is choosing to stay on the sidelines as valuations soar and why he believes the secondary market currently offers far better opportunities for long-term investors. Edited Excerpts – Q) Thanks for taking the time out. We have seen fresh momentum in markets, which pushed benchmark indices higher last week largely on trade deal hopes. How are you reading all this? A) It is my pleasure. Yes, the markets saw some renewed optimism and then gave back some of it. The market has seen time correction in the last one year ending Sep’25, of course with a lot of volatility and intermittent highs and lows. The tariff related uncertainties contributed to the volatility starting from the “liberation day.” The news flow around tariff since August has been adverse to India and every incremental news has been met with volatility. In my view, we seem to be making some progress but with the regime in the USA, nothing is done until it is done. I would rather watch for the evolving geo-political alignment and how we navigate this. So far it has been only on the goods trade but there are ominous signs that this may spill over to the services. The first order impact of the goods tariff is not expected to be very significant for the listed space. While we seem to be navigating the goods tariff with counter domestic stimulus like GST 2.0 and other support measures for the affected sectors, any adverse moves by the USA on the services could have serious impact. Our government has been tactful while maintaining our long-term objectives and I am hopeful we will reach a solution soon. Our diversified equity funds in the ULIP space were tilting heavily towards the large caps in the last one year and that has helped us weather this correction well. Q) Precious metals, which broke all records, cooled off a bit in the past few weeks. Do you see further weakness, or is it just a pause? A) The precious metals particularly gold is historically believed to be a good hedge against inflation, uncertainty and in India against the currency depreciation additionally. Indian households have always been great believers in this. For the past few years, the global central banks have also been increasing their gold holdings driven by the fear of US dollar currency assets losing value and some bit of trepidation around the political ramifications on these holdings in times of geo-political uncertainties. But this year, i.e., in 2025, the data does not seem to suggest any major increase in purchases by the central banks. So, this makes me believe that the run in the prices of precious metals may be partly due to these being treated as another momentum asset class by the investors. Watch out for lab grown gold, which if successful, can disrupt and challenge the scarcity premium. Q) The US Fed seems to be on an easing spree with the recent 25 bps rate cut. How would that impact RBI policy back home and equity markets? A) The Fed has been very calibrated, pausing almost a year after the initial cuts and now after 2 cuts seems to be guiding the market hawkishly. They have twin objectives of inflation and employment. Our own central bank has been very supportive of growth while maintaining vigil on prices. The recent monetary policy, in my reading was very dovish leaving a possible cut in the December meeting open. Lower rates are good for borrowers and hence the consumption stocks. For the banks though this may mean some medium-term margin pains, whereas the NBFCs largely be less affected or some benefiting. Q) Most of the Nifty50 companies have come out with their results. How are you reading into numbers, management commentary, and the revival of earnings? A) On muted expectations, companies have largely delivered well even when you strip off the commodities space that has done exceptionally well. More importantly the commentaries have been encouraging. My sense is we are close to the end of earnings downgrade cycle. That bodes well for the outlook. Banks have reported decent numbers and the asset quality issues that we saw in certain pockets for the past few quarters seem to have been contained. Capital is flowing into this sector. We have to see how the credit growth pans out. The recent RBI measures to ease many lending norms should help. However, we have to watch out for the underlying credit demand given there are other avenues of capital that are easily available like equity, NBFCs, boutique infra lenders and so on. While there are some green shoots of private Capex reviving, there are enough internal accruals and other avenues of capital. NBFCs on the other hand, some of the well managed ones, seem to have grown and weathered the cyclical headwinds. Even the margins have either expanded a bit or have been protected. On the consumption side, while the GST induced demand may not have fully flown into the Q2 numbers of Auto and other consumption related stocks, the subsequent business updates and management commentaries are very constructive. One has to, of course, see if the uptick sustains in the medium term. IT numbers continue to be tepid in the large cap space. But their problems are different. Q) Also, do you see any red flags that investors should track or watch out for in the next few quarters from the earnings? A) Investing is all about risk management. The key risks to earnings could emanate from headwinds to demand. I am not saying this is going to happen but at this stage we have many things going well for us but since you asked me about areas of risk, I am mentioning few potential areas. The evolving geo-political situation and the tariff related uncertainty could spill into services, employment and hence the aggregate demand. We at Aviva always advise our policyholders to stick to their asset allocation and have a balanced portfolio. Bonds after delivering very good one year returns in Apr cooled off. After few months of tepid performance, we believe, at currently obtaining long term yields, bonds may give decent returns in the next year or so. Q) Which sectors are looking attractive now, post Q2 earnings? A) As long-term investors, we continue to like the consumption theme. Financials space has many opportunities. Domestic focused health care, pharma companies offer some structural plays. We like utilities and defense space too. Q) What is your view on the recent wave of new listings on Dalal Street? Are there any interesting names you’re tracking? Also, given that most IPOs leave little on the table for retail investors, do you think it’s better to look for opportunities in the secondary market? A) Let me step back a bit. The global AI trade is kind of raging and with India largely being left out of this, the foreign flows are negative for us. Our own valuations were not cheap either and relative valuation game was also on. I think at some stage either the AI trade will peak out or the game on relative valuation will be largely done or both may happen. Then the flows may turn positive. On the other hand, the domestic retail investors continue their faith in the equity as a tool for long term wealth creation. Barring a few months of blip in early this year, the monthly MF flows into equity funds remained in the vicinity of USD 4-5 billion. The domestic individual investors (directly and through MF, Insurance) now hold close to one fourth of the India market cap. So, this money seems to be supporting the horde of supply in the form new listings, QIPs etc. There are few companies that offer exposure to new areas within consumption space. You are right. The valuations have been demanding or where they are less expensive the demand seems multi-fold. So, we are largely keeping away from the IPOs.

"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent explained on Meet the Press “The Europeans tell me, ‘Oh, we’re doing our 19th sanctions package.’ In my line Kristen, if you’re going to do something 19 times, you failed,” Bessent said on the Sunday show. “Instead, President Trump will move forward with a bold initiative that the Europeans would not follow us on. He put a 25 percent tariff on India because they were buying Russian oil. On Monday, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced it would remove eight persons from its sanctions list. Bessent said, “They were funding the war on themselves,” noting that Europeans were buying oil from Indian refineries that they refused to tariff. Undersecretary of the Treasury John Hurley on Monday said that the Treasury Department is no longer issuing sanctions for the purpose of “political posturing.” “The Biden administration issued a large number of sanctions often without a clear strategic purpose. Under President Trump and Secretary Bessent’s leadership, no longer are we issuing sanctions for the purpose of political posturing. Treasury is focused on sanctions that are financially and economically effective and that advance defined national security objectives,” Hurley told Breitbart News in a written statement. “We will also continue to remove sanctions when applicable and consistent with the law after a thorough review. The goal is simple: To ensure our sanctions are impactful, lawful, and aligned with President Trump’s agenda,” he added. OFAC removed eight persons from the sanctions list, which includes five individuals and three entities. Three individuals on the list had resigned from their prior roles and severed their relationships with Russian financier Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov. The Biden administration, along with the United Kingdom, sanctioned Usmanov, one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires, and his network. A Treasury spokesperson said that these removals are not indicative of any shifts in American policy towards Russia, and the removals are part of a monthslong review process. The spokesperson said that OFAC not only has the ability to sanction individuals but must remain willing to remove them from the list consistent with federal law.

"Justice Amy Coney Barrett had pointed questions Wednesday about the law Donald Trump invoked to impose global tariffs, joining several other justices on the right and left in voicing skepticism about the president’s ability to use a tool he has deemed critical to carrying out his economic agenda. Solicitor General John Sauer repeatedly argued during the lengthy 2½-hour oral arguments that the emergency law Trump used to enact the tariffs for nearly every U.S. trading partner contained language about regulating imports, which Sauer said included using tariffs. The relevant statute permits the president to ""regulate … nullify [and] void … importation,"" but it does not use the word ""tariff."" Barrett pressed Sauer on this point. ""Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase together, ‘regulate importation,’ has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?"" Barrett, a Trump appointee, asked. SUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY Sauer noted one other trade law that had served as a precursor to the emergency law in question, but Barrett appeared unconvinced, repeating her question as Sauer failed to offer direct responses. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, an Obama appointee, interjected, asking Sauer to ""just answer the justice’s question."" Sotomayor at one point noted that no president has ever used the emergency law, known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to impose tariffs, though Sauer argued that President Richard Nixon’s tariffs were used that way even if the IEEPA did not exist at that stage. ""It's a congressional power, not a presidential power to tax,"" Sotomayor said. ""And you want to say tariffs are not taxes. But that's exactly what they are. They're generating money from American citizens, revenue."" The liberal justice noted that Congress has always used the phrase ""regulate and tax"" together, suggesting that the absence of any mention of tariffs or taxes in a law's language was deliberate and that Congress purposely did not grant that power to the president. ""Are you telling us that, with respect to its use of ‘regulate’ in other statutes, the taxing reference is superfluous? They didn’t need to do that?"" Sotomayor asked. TRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER' Both Barrett and Sotomayor also drilled down on other verbs in the statute, underscoring the absence of tariff powers. ""To me, things like ‘nullify’ and ‘void’ have definite meanings. I agree with you that ‘regulate’ is a broader term, but those words, I think, are powerful,"" Barrett said. Sotomayor was more blunt: ""The verbs that accompany ‘regulate’ have nothing to do with raising revenues in the form of taxes."" The case has become one of the most closely watched of the term and has presented a novel question to the high court that Trump framed this week as ""life or death."" ""Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them."" Sauer told the justices that Trump views the trade deficit and opioid epidemic as ""country killing and not sustainable"" and that he has chosen to address them by using the IEEPA to impose tariffs. Sauer highlighted the success of the trade agreements Trump has made with top foreign competitors, like China, because of the president's tariff choices. ""Unwinding those agreements, [Trump] warns, would expose us to ruthless trade retaliation by far more aggressive countries and drive America from strength to failure with ruinous economic and national security consequences,"" Sauer said. Sauer argued the emergency law gives the president the power to regulate importation and that ""the power to tariff is a core application of that,"" even if not explicitly stated in the law. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In addition to the liberal justices and Barrett, other Republican-appointed justices conveyed skepticism, including Chief Justice John Roberts, who questioned how far presidential emergency powers go under the law. ""The exercise of the power is to impose tariffs, and the statute doesn’t use the word tariffs,"" Roberts said.",right
"President Donald Trump on Thursday slammed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, calling him ""seriously r------d"" and accusing the governor of failing to address crime and immigration concerns in the blue state. In a lengthy Truth Social post, Trump argued that immigration is fueling crime nationwide and straining public services. He pointed to Minnesota as a prime example, claiming that ""Somalian gangs are roving the streets"" of what he described as a ""once great state."" ""A very Happy Thanksgiving salutation to all of our Great American Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed at, along with certain other foolish countries throughout the World, for being ‘Politically Correct,’ and just plain STUPID, when it comes to Immigration,"" Trump said. WHITE HOUSE RIPS 'IMBECILIC BUFFOON' TIM WALZ AFTER TRUMP TARIFF CRITICISM Trump said the nation’s 53 million foreign-born residents are largely ""on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels"" and argued that American taxpayers are being forced to shoulder the cost. He further claimed that a migrant earning $30,000 with a green card receives ""roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family."" ""This refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America,"" Trump said, blaming it for issues including crime, urban decline, overcrowded hospitals, housing shortages and growing deficits. Trump pointed to Minnesota, alleging that ""hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over"" the state and claiming that Governor Walz ""does nothing"" in response. ""Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for ‘prey’ as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone,"" Trump said. ""The seriously r------d Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both."" 5 TIMES DEMOCRATS BLASTED ICE WITH HARSH RHETORIC Walz responded on X to a screenshot of the Truth Social post, writing: ""Release the MRI results."" Indiana state Senator Michael Bohacek, who has a daughter with Down syndrome, condemned Trump's language as ""insulting and derogatory,"" saying the president's ""words have consequences."" ""I have been an unapologetic advocate for people with intellectual disabilities since the birth of my second daughter,"" Bohacek said. ""… This is not the first time our president has used these insulting and derogatory references and his choices of words have consequences. I will be voting NO on redistricting, perhaps he can use the next 10 months to convince voters that his policies and behavior deserve a congressional majority."" In the post, Trump also targeted Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, calling her the ""worst congressman/woman in our Country."" ""Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab, and who probably came into the U.S.A. illegally in that you are not allowed to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our Country, its Constitution, and how ‘badly’ she is treated, when her place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which is essentially not even a country for lack of Government, Military, Police, schools, etc,"" Trump said. WALZ REPEATS DEBUNKED CLAIM THAT TRUMP CONSIDERS WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM 'TOP PRIORITY' The comments follow shortly after the Thanksgiving Eve shooting in Washington, D.C., that left one West Virginia National Guard member dead and another clinging to his life.

"As Elon Musk reveals he tried to convince President Donald Trump not to implement sweeping tariffs, U.S. manufacturers are linking the levies with industry troubles. In an interview with investor and entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath released on Sunday, Musk said he warned Trump against tariffs, arguing they “create distortions in markets.” The Tesla CEO has previously expressed concern that import taxes would cause a recession and drive up the prices of goods. In April, the EV maker stopped taking orders for some models in China, which then faced a retaliatory 125% tariff. “The president has made it clear he loves tariffs,” Musk said in the interview. “I’ve tried to dissuade him from this point of view, but unsuccessfully.” “Would you want tariffs between you and everyone else at an individual level? That would make life very difficult,” he continued. “Would you want tariffs between each city? No, that would be very annoying. Would you want tariffs between each state within the United States? No, that would be disastrous for the economy. So then, why do you want tariffs between countries?” The White House didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Beyond the levies threatening Musk’s own company, American manufacturers are now linking Trump’s tariffs to the shrinking industry and tough labor cuts they’ve needed to make to keep their businesses going. It’s the opposite of Trump’s intentions when implementing the tariffs, which he claimed would be a catalyst for reshoring American factory jobs. U.S. manufacturing contracted in November for the ninth consecutive month, according to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMIreport released on Monday, with pullbacks in new orders and supplier deliveries, as well as employment. Some manufacturing industry personnel surveyed attributed slowing business and tightening labor to the levies, even saying they’ve increased overseas production. “We are starting to institute more permanent changes due to the tariff environment,” one survey respondent in the transportation equipment industry said, per the report. “This includes reduction of staff, new guidance to shareholders, and development of additional offshore manufacturing that would have otherwise been for U.S. export.” Tariff-induced labor woes Recent jobs data has confirmed some manufacturers’ concerns. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ jobs report last month showed there were 6,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in October, despite nonfarm payrolls increasing by 119,000. The slip in factory roles have brought the tally of lost manufacturing jobs since Trump’s April tariff push to 59,000, according to the data. Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Fortune the shrinking manufacturing sector is, in part, a result of tariffs disproportionately hitting intermediate goods, which are products used in the process of creating a finished good. This can hike up production costs, forcing companies to slash headcount. Pantheon Macroeconomics analysts Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen similarly said in September that shrinking wage growth was a result of tariff-hit companies trying to maintain margins amid rising input costs. Ullrich also noted trade uncertainty more broadly forces companies to think less about hiring and more about sourcing decisions and pricing. “It is striking how soft manufacturing has been because, in theory, you put tariffs in place to protect domestic manufacturing, so that domestic manufacturing employment grows,” Ullrich said. “And we have seen the opposite of that.” Despite warming trade relations between the U.S. and China, some manufacturers say the tough decisions around workforce reductions will continue as long as tariffs present a problem. “Going into 2026, we expect to see big changes with cash flow and employee headcount,” one ISM survey respondent said. “The company has sold off a big part of the business that generated free cash while offering voluntary severance packages to anyone.”",right
"Estimates suggest the program could cost around $300 billion. Current tariff revenue is roughly $90 billion. That leaves a massive gap. Lawmakers are skeptical. Some Republicans worry about the economic impact, potential inflation, and long-term debt. Others question if the checks are even fair. Even if Congress approves the payments, it will take months to finalize eligibility criteria. How much will each household get? Who qualifies? These details are still unclear. Treasury officials will need to design a distribution mechanism. Analysts say the earliest realistic payout is 2026, not late 2025. Legal hurdles add another layer of uncertainty. The administration’s tariff authority is under court review. If courts block or scale back tariffs, the funding for the $2,000 checks could disappear entirely. Even favorable rulings will require careful alignment with federal spending rules. There is no guarantee checks will arrive on time—or at all. For Americans counting on the money, caution is key. Relying on the rebate for holiday spending or bills is risky. While $2,000 could provide short-term relief, economists warn it might push prices higher. Tariffs increase import costs, and large direct payments can add to inflationary pressures. The proposal is political as much as it is financial. Trump frames it as a way to reward Americans from tariff revenue, but Congress is lukewarm. Lawmakers are weighing economic risks versus voter appeal. Until they act, the checks remain a proposal, not a guarantee. Americans should stay informed but plan cautiously. Monitoring Congressional updates and court rulings will be key. Until legislation passes, funding is confirmed, and eligibility rules are finalized, the $2,000 tariff rebate remains a promise, not a paycheck. Don’t count your $2,000 yet. Congress, courts, and logistics all stand in the way. While the idea is real, the checks are months away at best. Waiting and watching is the only safe approach. Why are the $2,000 checks still on hold? The main reason the checks haven’t been distributed is Congress must approve them first. The proposal cannot move forward automatically. Even though the White House has pitched the idea as a “tariff dividend,” it requires legislation before the Treasury can act.Many lawmakers are cautious. Some Republicans express concern that funding these checks could increase costs or create economic risks, especially if tariffs don’t generate enough revenue. Others are worried about long-term debt implications. Until lawmakers come to an agreement, the checks are effectively on pause. Even if Congress expresses support, there is still a lengthy process. Drafting a bill, passing it through committees, and voting on it will take weeks, if not months. This means any potential payments are still months away from being realistic. Finally, there is the political dimension. The proposal may be aimed at appealing to voters, but it still faces significant opposition. Lawmakers are weighing whether the economic benefits outweigh the risks, and until a compromise is reached, the checks cannot move forward. How much money is actually available to fund these checks? One of the biggest questions is whether tariff revenue can cover the $2,000 payout. Estimates suggest the program could cost around $300 billion if all eligible Americans receive the full amount. Current revenue from tariffs is roughly $90 billion, which leaves a large gap.This shortfall has raised concerns among economists. Critics warn that using tariffs to fund a rebate could strain the economy. Tariffs themselves often raise import costs, which can trickle down to higher prices for everyday goods. If this happens alongside a large cash payment, it could create inflationary pressures rather than relief. There is also uncertainty about which groups would qualify. Low- and middle-income earners are expected to be the primary recipients, but exact income thresholds have not been finalized. Determining eligibility is an essential step in ensuring the payments are fair and effective. Because of these funding and eligibility concerns, experts say the checks are unlikely to arrive quickly. Even if Congress approves the plan, finalizing the numbers could take months. Could legal challenges stop the checks altogether? Another major hurdle is legal uncertainty. The administration’s ability to impose broad tariffs is already being challenged in courts across the country. If these tariffs are ruled illegal, the funding for the $2,000 rebate would disappear.Legal challenges could also slow down the process. Courts may review the authority of the executive branch to redirect tariff revenue to individuals. Until these issues are resolved, no payments can be made safely. Even if a court ruling is favorable, there could be additional legal steps to ensure compliance with budget and spending laws. Treasury officials would need to align the program with federal rules, further delaying distribution. For Americans counting on the rebate, this creates uncertainty. Even with strong political support, the combination of legal and procedural hurdles means there is no guarantee the checks will arrive on schedule—or at all. When could Americans realistically see these payments? Timing is one of the most frequently asked questions. Even if Congress approves the plan tomorrow, distribution would not be immediate. The government first needs to set up eligibility criteria, confirm funding, and design a mechanism to send the checks.Experts suggest that, at best, payments could start sometime in 2026. Any suggestion that checks will arrive in late 2025 is likely overly optimistic. Americans should prepare for a longer wait than some media reports suggest. This timeline also depends on how quickly lawmakers act and whether the legal challenges to the tariff program are resolved. A single court decision could push the schedule back by several months. For households budgeting around these checks, it is wise to avoid assuming the money will be available soon. Financial planning should be based on current resources, not on anticipated tariff rebates.

"Mortgage rates await the fate of Trump's tariffs Robert McLister: The path for rates now largely rests on how much harder (or lighter) Trump hits Canada with tariffs With United States President Donald Trump’s tariff policy still fogging up Canada’s economic outlook, mortgage rates remain in a two-year downtrend. And yet, despite the Bank of Canada’s “preferred” inflation gauge sitting at a still-naughty 3.15 per cent, “upward (inflation) momentum has dissipated,” insisted Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem on Thursday. If he’s right — and that’s extremely TBD — it implies less upside rate risk in 2026. That said, core inflation’s stubborn refusal to hit the two-per-cent target is a glaring reason why Macklem is hinting that rate cuts may be done for a while. As for the bond market, it concurs. Forward rates, as tracked by CanDeal DNA, show the market implying a 15 per cent chance of another Bank of Canada rate cut on December 10. The odds in 2026 are basically a coin flip. This week’s rate movers Among leading lenders who advertise in at least nine out of ten provinces, here is this week’s rate action: - One-year fixed (insured): rose four basis points to 4.69 per cent - Three-year fixed (insured): fell five basis points to 3.84 per cent - Five-year fixed (insured): rose five basis points to 3.79 per cent - Ten-year fixed (insured): rose nine basis points to 5.06 per cent - Variable (uninsured): fell 20 basis points to 3.69 per cent The path for rates now largely rests on how much harder (or lighter) Trump hits Canada with tariffs. We’ll have a better idea of that within a few months, pending a U.S. Supreme Court tariff ruling and a January notice provision in the Canada–United States–Mexico trade pact. The latter requires the U.S. to indicate its intentions on renewing the crucial agreement next July. Meanwhile, the economic suspense never ends. So if playing the rate guessing game isn’t your brand of thrills and you need a mortgage for five-plus years, consider a hybrid (part fixed and part variable).

"The 47th Asean Summit held recently was more than a diplomatic reunion - it was a reminder of the promises and pitfalls that have defined India's trade journey with the region. When Asean-India Trade in Goods Agreement (Aitiga) was signed in 2010, the premise was simple: deepen market access with neighbours. The outcome was less tidy. Since Aitiga's implementation, Asean's share in India's exports has fallen from 10.2% to 8.9%, while its share in our imports has risen sharply from 8.3% to 11.7% - a telling asymmetry that suggests the agreement opened India up more than it opened Asean. India reduced or eliminated tariffs on almost 90% of tariff lines under Aitiga, while Indonesia and Vietnam removed tariffs on roughly 50% and 70% of lines respectively. Malaysia and Singapore, operating with near-zero MFN duties, had little room to offer additional concessions. Add non-tariff barriers - product and process standards - and Indian farm and manufacturing exporters have found little real access despite headline tariff cuts. Meanwhile, India's dependence on Asean has deepened. Around 30% of India's imported coal now comes from Indonesia, more than half of imported base metals from Thailand, and almost half of vegetable oil imports are sourced from the region. This dependence creates both strategic leverage and vulnerability, especially if some imports are cheap re-routes or circumventions from other markets. These lessons are now finding expression in the trade pacts India is negotiating - and the caution is unmistakable. The India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) embodies calibrated reciprocity: Britain plans to eliminate duties on 99.6% of India's exports by value over 7 yrs, while India will reciprocate on roughly 70% of imports over a 10-yr horizon, with phased openings and quotas for sensitive lines. Sensitive sectors - notably agriculture and dairy - have been kept outside the ambit of the agreement. Rules of origin and anti-circumvention clauses have been tightened, and the pact extends into services, investment and people-to-people mobility. Talks with the EU are bumping against non-tariff demands - carbon levies, environmental and labour standards - and India has pushed back on oversight mechanisms that could erode sovereignty. With the US, India is standing firm on protecting agricultural and other sensitive domestic sectors. A rejig of Aitiga is also on the cards. These are not technicalities, they are lessons learnt the hard way. Where should India focus? Three pragmatic prescriptions stand out: Ensure symmetry - any market opening should be matched in value and substance, so that gains do not one-sidedly accrue to partners. Operationalise non-tariff barrier resolution - give teeth to the trade agreement. Tighten rules of origin, and include robust anti-circumvention and rapid dispute-resolution mechanisms. Vague text invites exploitation. Of course, deals alone won't deliver exports. Competitiveness will. Even the most balanced treaty is ineffective if exporters cannot meet quality, timeliness and price expectations. Investments in logistics, skilling, quality control and manufacturing efficiency must accompany trade openings. Sure, policy certainty reduces business risk, but converting access into orders requires export competitiveness. For investors and business leaders, the implication is simple: look beyond headlines. Sectoral winners will be the companies that translate improved access into sustainable revenue and margin growth - particularly in textiles, pharmaceuticals and engineering goods, where India has demonstrable strengths. That said, political sensitivities around sectors like agriculture and dairy mean bargains may be partial and phased; expect implementation lags. Practically, New Delhi should pair phased tariff liberalisation with a clear domestic reform timeline - think 3-5-yr windows for capacity upgrades, targeted export credit and logistical support, and an export-readiness fund to help SMEs meet standards. Digitalisation can trim bureaucracy: automated certificates of origin, single-window customs and fast-tracked compliance for trusted traders will make trade facilitation realistic rather than rhetorical. Investors should track which firms operationalise these changes. Timing, enforceability and domestic reforms will ultimately determine which exporters capture durable gains. Negotiations will be messy, and outcomes will be imperfect. But the playbook is clear: demand calibrated reciprocity, harden rules of origin, build efficient compliance systems and - crucially - invest domestically to raise exporter competitiveness. Done right, trade deals can be catalysts for higher-value exports. Done poorly, they become avenues for one-way market exposure.

"Wednesday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said Tuesday’s elections were voters saying President Donald Trump “cannot be trusted to manage this economy.” Host Chris Hates said, “What is your reaction to to what happened last night?” Warren said, “There’s a big pushback against Donald Trump. But look at the other half and that is the message that the Democrats ran on. What Zohran ran on, what Abigail ran on, what Mikie ran on was affordability, affordability, affordability. They were out there talking about what’s happening to American families right now in Donald Trump’s economy, how people are smashed against the wall.” She added, “He’s out there playing tariff chaos and part of tariff chaos is driving up costs again for families. So now it costs more to build a new house or to build a new apartment building. All of those things are why it is that people are saying Donald Trump cannot be trusted to manage this economy. And at the same time, Democrats are standing up and again, not just saying we’re not Donald Trump, they’re saying, here are our plans, here’s what we’re going to deliver, here’s what we’re in the fight for. I think people like that a lot.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"President Donald Trump blamed his hoarse voice on a tense discussion with a foreign nation who attempted to renegotiate the terms of their trade deal. Trump sported a raspy voice during a meeting with the White House’s task force on the FIFA World Cup 2026, prompting a reporter to ask if he felt alright. ""I feel great. I was shouting at people because they were stupid about something having to do with trade and a country, and I straightened it out, but I blew my stack at these people,"" Trump told reporters Monday. When pressed about which country, Trump did not specify which nation sparked his ire and only said that he wasn’t pleased. TRUMP, XI MEET IN EFFORT TO RESOLVE TRADE TENSIONS SPARKED BY US TARIFFS ""A country wanted to try and renegotiate the terms of their trade deal,"" Trump said. ""And I wasn't happy about it."" When asked again which country, Trump said: ""Why would I say that to you?"" The U.S. has engaged in trade talks with a number of countries in recent months, including Japan, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia. Additionally, Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, where the two hammered out some negotiations on trade between the two countries. TRUMP SAYS CHINA WILL WORK WITH HIM TO STOP FENTANYL TRAFFICKING For example, Trump said he agreed to cut tariffs on Chinese imports by 10% — bring down the rate from 57% to 47% — because China said it would work with the U.S. on addressing the fentanyl crisis. Likewise, Trump said that he would not impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods that were expected to kick in Nov. 1. Trump threatened the steep hike after China announced in October it would impose export controls on rare-earth magnets, which he said China had agreed to postpone by a year.

""Zero, to 10, with 10 being the best, I’d say the meeting was a 12,"" Trump told reporters after meeting with Xi. ""A lot of decisions were made … and we’ve come to a conclusion on very many important points.""",right
"Conservative members of the Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared skeptical of President Donald Trump’s sweeping unilateral tariffs midway through arguments in a case that’s a pivotal test of executive power for a tool central to his broader agenda. While the questions at times seemed to challenge the rationale for the tariffs, the arguments are still ongoing, and further questioning could shed additional light on their positions. A decision in the case could take weeks or months. The Republican administration is trying to defend the tariffs central to Trump’s economic agenda after lower courts ruled the emergency law he invoked doesn’t give him near-limitless power to set and change duties on imports. The Constitution says Congress has the power to levy tariffs. But the Trump administration argues that in emergency situations the president can regulate importation — and that includes tariffs. Justice Amy Coney Barrett grilled the government on that point. “Has there ever been another instance in which a statute has used that language to confer the power?” she asked. Justices Neil Gorsuch also questioned the government on whether Trump’s position would hand congressional powers to the president. Trump has called the case one of the most important in the country’s history and said a ruling against him would be catastrophic for the economy. The challengers argue the 1977 emergency powers law Trump used doesn’t even mention tariffs, and no president before has used it to impose them. A collection of small businesses say the uncertainty is driving them to the brink of bankruptcy. The case centers on two sets of tariffs. The first came in February on imports from Canada, China and Mexico after Trump declared a national emergency over drug trafficking. The second involves the sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on most countries that Trump announced in April. Multiple lawsuits have been filed over the tariffs, and the court will hear suits filed by Democratic-leaning states and small businesses focused on everything from plumbing supplies to women’s cycling apparel. Lower courts have struck down the bulk of Trump’s tariffs as an illegal use of emergency power, but the nation’s highest court may see it differently. Trump helped shape the conservative majority court, naming three of the nine justices in his first term. The justices have so far been reluctant to check his extraordinary flex of executive power, handing him a series of wins on the court’s emergency docket. Still, those have been short-term orders — little of Trump’s wide-ranging conservative agenda has been fully argued before the nation’s highest court. That means the outcome could set the tone for wider legal pushback against his policies. The justices have been skeptical of executive power claims before, such as when then-President Joe Biden tried to forgive $400 billion in student loans under a different law dealing with national emergencies. The Supreme Court found the law didn’t clearly give him the power to enact a program with such a big economic impact, a legal principle known as the major questions doctrine. The challengers say Trump’s tariffs should get the same treatment, since they’ll have a much greater economic effect, raising some $3 trillion over the next decade. The government, on the other hand, says the tariffs are different because they’re a major part of his approach to foreign affairs, an area where the courts should not be second-guessing the president. The challengers are also trying to channel the conservative justices’ skepticism about whether the Constitution allows other parts of the government to use powers reserved for Congress, a concept known as the nondelegation doctrine. Trump’s interpretation of the law could mean anyone who can “regulate” can also impose taxes, they say. The Justice Department counters that legal principle is for governmental agencies, not for the president. If he eventually loses at the high court, Trump could impose tariffs under other laws, but those have more limitations on the speed and severity with which he could act. The aftermath of a ruling against him also could be complicated, if the government must issue refunds for the tariffs that had collected $195 billion in revenue as of September. The Trump administration did win over four appeals court judges who found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, gives the president authority to regulate importation during emergencies without explicit limitations. In recent decades, Congress has ceded some tariff authority to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",right
"During an interview with Variety on Thursday, film producer Brian Grazer revealed that he received ""blowback"" from his peers in Hollywood after it became known that he voted for President Donald Trump in 2024. When asked how people in the ""liberal town"" of Hollywood reacted after his vote for Trump was made public, Grazer said, ""There was blowback."" The interviewer followed up, asking Grazer whether his political views had caused others to not want to work with him. ""No. I am what I am. I haven’t changed,"" he responded. ""I don’t know if I should say anything more than that."" Grazer was seen with Trump and his entourage in a VIP box at a football game this summer — a moment that was featured in the Fox Nation documentary ""Art of the Surge."" The New York Times reported that the Hollywood producer is shown posing for a photo with the president and telling others in the room that he had voted for Trump that year.

Grazer told the group, according to the Times. When the Times contacted him following the football game, Grazer provided some context as to why he voted for Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.

"Viral messages online promising new IRS payments are misleading. Headlines like “IRS depositing $1,390 this week” or “$2,000 stimulus checks in November” spread quickly but cite no official source. Fact-checkers confirm that no active payment schedule exists. Links, pop-ups, or emails asking for Social Security numbers or bank details are likely phishing scams. Some Americans are curious about President Donald Trump’s tariff dividend proposal. The plan aims to convert federal tariff revenue into dividend payments around $2,000 per person, excluding higher-income households. While interesting, the proposal has not been legislated. Payments could come as tax credits or targeted relief, not necessarily as direct deposits or checks. Experts warn that tariff revenue alone may not fund nationwide payments at this scale, raising doubts about feasibility. Until any legislation changes, Americans should not expect IRS deposits in November 2025. Keeping bank and tax information updated with the IRS is critical to avoid delays in any future program. Official announcements appear only on IRS.gov or Treasury Department websites. The IRS never contacts taxpayers via email, text, or social media for payment verification. Any attempt to “pre-register” or “expedite” checks is fraudulent. The takeaway is simple: no new stimulus payments are confirmed, and rumors about $1,390 or $2,000 checks are unsupported. Trump’s tariff dividend is only a proposal, not law. The safest way to stay informed is to monitor credible sources and ignore online claims designed to trick users. Planning finances based on rumors can create unnecessary stress and risk. Americans should remain alert, verify information, and focus on official updates. Any future relief programs will be publicly announced through verified channels. Until then, all reports of November 2025 IRS payments are speculation or scam. Staying cautious protects personal data and prevents exposure to fraud while keeping you ready for any real relief programs in the future. Is there a new IRS stimulus check for November 2025? No, there is currently no new IRS or federal stimulus payment scheduled for November 2025. The Internal Revenue Service has not announced any new round of direct deposit relief or economic impact payments.The last official stimulus checks were issued as part of COVID‑19 relief programs, which ended several years ago. These programs are now considered historical, and no further deposits are planned. Any viral messages or posts claiming new payments, such as ""$1,390 IRS relief checks"" or ""$2,000 stimulus in November,"" are unverified rumors circulating online. They do not have any official backing. It is important to be cautious of any links, pop-ups, or messages suggesting you can claim a new payment. These are often phishing attempts designed to steal personal information or banking details. The safest way to stay informed is by checking official channels for verified updates rather than relying on social media posts or forwarded messages. Scammers exploit the excitement about potential stimulus checks. They may ask for Social Security numbers, bank account details, or other sensitive information under the pretense of expediting payments. The IRS has clarified that any new relief payments must come through Congress and be officially announced. Only verified announcements via IRS.gov or Treasury releases are legitimate. Staying informed and cautious helps prevent falling victim to scams, and it protects your personal and financial security in a time of widespread misinformation. What is Trump’s tariff dividend proposal? While no IRS stimulus is currently coming, President Donald Trump has proposed a plan called the “tariff dividend.” The idea has gained national attention as a potential form of direct payment to Americans.President Donald Trump's tariff dividend proposal is a plan to pay each American a dividend check of at least $2,000 funded by revenue collected from tariffs on imported goods. The proposal excludes high-income individuals and aims to redistribute tariff revenue back to middle and low-income Americans. The White House has expressed commitment to the plan, with economic advisers exploring ways to implement it, but specific details on qualification and operation have not been fully disclosed. The proposal is based on the idea that tariff revenue collected by the government, which was $195 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2025, could be used to fund direct payments to Americans. However, estimates indicate the cost to pay $2,000 to roughly 150 million Americans earning $100,000 or less would amount to approximately $300 billion per round, exceeding current tariff revenue and requiring potential future revenue or federal borrowing. Experts note the plan has not been passed into law. There is no guarantee payments would be issued as physical checks or direct deposits. Some could instead come as tax credits or targeted relief programs. Analysts also question whether tariff revenue alone would be sufficient to fund nationwide payments at this scale. Fiscal feasibility and budget limitations make the proposal uncertain. While the tariff dividend is an interesting concept, Americans should understand it is still conceptual and not a substitute for an actual IRS stimulus program. What should Americans do now to stay safe and prepared? Until Congress approves new legislation, no IRS payments are arriving this November. It is essential to maintain accurate personal and tax information with the IRS to avoid delays if future programs are introduced.Always check official websites such as IRS.gov or the Treasury Department for updates. These platforms post only verified information regarding approved programs. Avoid clicking on links that promise early access, pre-registration, or expedited approval for stimulus payments. The IRS never contacts taxpayers via email, text, or social media to confirm eligibility or request personal information. Keeping bank accounts, addresses, and tax records updated ensures you will receive any legitimate relief if it is introduced in the future. Being proactive can save time and prevent scams from targeting you. Americans should also continue monitoring economic news and government announcements, but always verify information before acting on it. As of mid-November 2025, no new IRS stimulus payments are confirmed. Claims about $1,390 or $2,000 direct deposits are false. Only proposals, such as Trump’s tariff dividend, are being discussed but have no legal authority. Misinformation spreads quickly online, so the best protection is relying on official sources. Watching for verified IRS or Treasury updates ensures you get accurate information and avoid scams. While discussions about relief programs and proposals continue into 2026, Americans should understand what is official versus speculative. Planning finances around rumors can lead to disappointment or risk exposure. Remaining informed, cautious, and proactive is the safest way to navigate the current landscape of stimulus rumors and potential future programs.

"President Donald Trump has been back in office long enough for Americans to expect at least glimmers of the economic golden age he promised. Instead, warning signals are flashing. They’re now coming from voters as well as from the patchy data available during a record-long government shutdown. The economy is expanding, but reliance on the artificial intelligence boom — and the stock-market wealth it’s generated — makes growth look lopsided. Play Video Democrats trounced Trump’s Republicans last week in elections where cost-of-living anxieties loomed large. Half of the respondents in an October survey by the Harris Poll for Bloomberg News said the economy wasn’t working for them – up from 41% in February – and only one-third said their finances were better than a year ago. To be sure, analysts caution against reading too much into off-year ballots, and many Trump policies have yet to fully kick in. His tax cuts promise to boost business investment, which has already thrived in the race to build data centers — though there’s also a headwind from Trump’s trade wars, which led many firms to freeze capital spending. For now, with the job market cooling, consumer surveys and political polls find that Americans are downbeat about the economy and the president’s handling of it. Democratic candidates who campaigned on pocketbook issues won by big margins in Virginia and New Jersey governors’ races — tapping the same anxiety over high prices that helped Trump defeat Joe Biden, and that he’d promised to relieve from day one. “The economy remains resilient on the surface, but it’s increasingly dependent on three narrow, interconnected ‘A-pillars’: affluent consumers, artificial intelligence-fueled investment and asset price gains,” wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon and president of the National Association for Business Economics. “If any one of these pillars weakens, the overall structure would become much less stable.” ‘Bearing Fruit’ The president and his team acknowledged their overhaul wouldn’t bear fruit overnight – while also setting expectations for when it would. By the fourth quarter, “you will feel the power of Donald Trump’s economy,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television back in March. Now, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is shifting that timeline. “2026 is going to be a gangbuster year and Americans will feel it in their pocketbooks,” he told Fox Business last week. Trump himself has argued he’s already delivered on his promises, telling reporters “I don’t want to hear about the affordability” because prices are “much less.” On the growth front, what economists see right now is a slowdown capping Trump’s rollercoaster first year. US gross domestic product shrank at the outset — thanks to a monumental import surge, as firms and consumers rushed to get ahead of tariffs — and then rebounded fast for a while. What the White House sees is a “gradual transition” underway between the Biden and Trump economies, according to Pierre Yared, acting chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. “The policies of the president are bearing fruit,” Yared said in a telephone interview. He pointed to three main metrics — overall growth, well-paying jobs, and building secure supply chains in America — as well as US outperformance over peers like the European Union. The shutdown has delayed the release of September jobs data and other economic numbers. Alternative sources indicate anemic hiring. Unemployment is low but rising. Companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Target Corp. are laying off workers. One report shows US firms announced the most job cuts for any October in more than two decades. Manufacturing in particular, where Trump promised a tariff-led renaissance, has struggled. It’s been in contraction for eight straight months and shed 42,000 jobs since April – the longest losing streak since the pandemic — after the president unveiled his global tariffs. Yared said what matters is the quality of jobs, and he pointed to a pickup in manufacturing productivity this year, as well as higher inflation-adjusted weekly pay in factories, mining and construction – all priority areas for the administration. In industries such as manufacturing, construction, agriculture and hospitality, the pool of available labor has shrunk in part because of Trump’s immigration crackdown. After a wave of raids and deportations, monthly border crossings — which surged under Biden — have plummeted close to zero. That’s left some employers struggling to find workers, though it also means fewer new jobs are required to keep unemployment steady. Still, the conservative American Enterprise Institute estimates that Trump’s policy shift will trim growth by as much as 0.4 percentage point this year. Surveys show Americans are worried about the job market — and the economy overall. RealClearPolitics polling averages for Trump’s approval ratings on the topic have declined sharply since he returned to office in January. Consumer sentiment this month plunged close to the lowest on record. Tariff Whipsaw Trade has been at the top of Trump’s second-term agenda. The president has followed through on campaign promises to hike import taxes, with the goals of revitalizing manufacturing, erasing deficits with US trading partners, and raising government revenue. The latter is happening: with US tariffs now their highest in roughly a century, the Treasury Department is collecting around $30 billion a month. Trump also touts the investments in the US that companies and trade partners have pledged as a result of his dealmaking. But his on-and-off approach to imposing the duties – illustrated again last month when he dialed back charges on Chinese imports – has caused tremendous uncertainty, with many businesses halting investment and hiring decisions until they see where rates settle. The Supreme Court may yet have a say in that. At a hearing last week, justices appeared skeptical that Trump had the constitutional authority to impose his country-based tariffs, and a ruling could come by year’s end. Most economists expect the trade war will drag on growth next year, though the hit to consumer prices hasn’t been as big as anticipated. Stubborn Prices At 3%, the headline inflation rate is roughly where it was when Trump took office, after prices surged a cumulative 20% under Biden in the pandemic aftermath. Business expectations for prices in the year ahead are holding steady, and the worst fears of consumers appear to have eased in recent months. Even so, complaints about the cost of living helped Democrats score double-digit wins in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races. One sore point in both states, and potentially nationwide in next year’s midterm voting, was the climb in electricity prices – new among America’s hot-button political issues. Trump and Bessent put cheaper energy at the heart of their program. They have cited this year’s drop in gasoline costs, and argued deregulation will lower them further. But the administration’s AI push may inflate electric bills because data centers need vast amounts of power. And while the AI giants enjoy tariff exemptions for key equipment, electricity generators aren’t so favored – raising the risk that capacity will fall behind demand and add to price pressures. ‘Undeniably Awesome’ One place where AI is definitely lifting prices is America’s stock market. The S&P 500 Index has added some $8 trillion in value this year, overcoming a spring slump triggered by Trump’s tariffs. The so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech giants are driving it. Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, recently became the world’s first $5 trillion company. All that new equity wealth has boosted consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of demand in the economy – but also skewed it toward the rich. Households in the top 10% of the income distribution accounted for 49.2% of spending in the second quarter, the highest share in data going back to 1989, according to Moody’s Analytics. Meanwhile there are signs that lower-income Americans are cutting back. It’s left some analysts talking about a “K-shape” economy almost a year into Trump’s second term – one in which some households and industries thrive while others struggle. “If you live in the upper spur of the ‘K,’ things are undeniably awesome,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. “But if you live and work in the lower spur of the ‘K,’ you’re stressed, things are at risk. And it seems like the economy’s becoming more insecure for people who live in that realm.”",right
"- In today’s CEO Daily: Phil Wahba digs into two retail CEOs’ succession plans. - The big story:Nvidia reports blockbuster earnings. - The markets: Nvidia sparks a rally. - Plus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune. Good morning. This week, a pair of earnings reports—those of Walmart and Target—offer up a reminder of how tricky CEO succession planning can be. Both retailers’ CEOs—Walmart’s Doug McMillon and Target’s Brian Cornell—started in 2014 and are leaving in February, handing their companies off to lieutenants who are company lifers. But that’s where the succession similarities end. Target and Walmart have long duked it out for the U.S.’s budget-conscious shopper, with Target skewing a bit more to discretionary “fun” items and Walmart to low-price staples. Though both chains thrived during the pandemic as people consolidated their shopping at fewer chains, Walmart pulled away from Target in 2022 and has never looked back. Walmart has become a tech and e-commerce powerhouse capable of holding its own against Amazon and has positioned itself well for the AI era. Walmart shares have risen 300% under McMillon. In contrast, Target’s shares are only up 60% under Cornell, whose tenure was considered stellar before the retailer began struggling with merchandise misses, backlash to its diversity efforts, and then backlash for abandoning those efforts, complaints about customer service, and supply chain problems that led to empty shelves. On Wednesday, Target reported that comparable sales were down 2.7% last quarter. Today, Wall Street analysts expect Walmart’s U.S. comparable sales to increase 3.8%. Interestingly, one of the departing CEOs is leaving his company’s board in 2026, while the other is staying on as executive chair, meaning he will be even more powerful than he was as CEO. You might think McMillon is the one sticking around to guide successor John Furner, who has an impressive track record as CEO of Walmart’s U.S. division. But no, Cornell is the one being elevated to a role with no defined term limit, overseeing his successor and current operations chief, Michael Fiddelke, even as both executives ultimately bear significant responsibility for Target’s current travails. That a CEO like McMillon, whose leadership style will be taught in business schools, can step down without causing investor panic shows how well Walmart has managed its succession planning and developed a deep bench. Target argues that Cornell and Fiddelke, well regarded executives to be fair, are insiders who can right the ship. However, Wall Street disagrees; it wanted an outsider to shake things up and has punished Target’s stock.—Phil Wahba Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Top news Nvidia shrugs off bubble fears Nvidia beat Wall Street’s expectations with a record $57 billion in revenue for the most recent quarter on the back of strong demand for its AI chips, quelling investor fears that the AI boom is overhyped. The world’s most valuable company implied that its Blackwell and Rubin chips could generate $300 billion in revenue next year, a sum that would catapult Nvidia into the top 10 of the Fortune 500. (It was No. 31 this year.) Preempting AI laws U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order that would attempt to block any state regulation of AI in a concession to tech companies that argue a patchwork of such laws will stifle innovation. Labor data gap The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says it will not release the October jobs report, citing the record government shutdown that prevented officials from collecting all the data they need. The omission will obscure the public’s understanding of how the labor market is faring amid signs of weakness. Mexico buys American For the first time in 30 years, Mexico is the top buyer of U.S. goods, surpassing Canada. (Mexico has been the U.S.’s top supplier since 2023 when it eclipsed China.) U.S.-Mexico trade has fared relatively well under the Trump administration since the president has repeatedly granted it tariff exemptions; the U.S.’s northern neighbor has not been as lucky. Stocks to watch for 2026 AI has driven much of the stock market gains this year while tariffs and geopolitical tensions have rendered once-reliable investments vulnerable. Fortune’s finance editors and reporters say these are the hot—and not—stocks for 2026. Alphabet CEO suggests AI could replace CEOs Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said he believes the CEO job “is maybe one of the easier things maybe for an AI to do one day” in a recent interview with the BBC.

"It’s a tough time to be looking for a job. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from U.S. President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many without paychecks. The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released last week, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. The shutdown also resulted in holes for more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: HP In November, HP said this week it expected to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 employees. The cuts are part of a wider initiative from the computer maker to streamline operations, which includes adopting AI to increase productivity. The company aims to complete these actions by the end of the 2028 fiscal year. Verizon Also in November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors General Motors will lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. Paramount In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon Amazon said in October that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. UPS United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target Target in October said it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. Nestlé In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. Lufthansa Group In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Novo Nordisk Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. ConocoPhillips Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. Microsoft In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. Procter & Gamble In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures.",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format As of mid-November 2025, no new stimulus payments have been authorized by Congress, and there have been no IRS confirmations indicating that stimulus check payments will be made before Christmas. Trump pledged on November 17 that the dividend payouts could come “sometime in 2026… probably in the middle of next year,” funded by hundreds of millions collected in tariff revenues. Trump’s idea to use tariff revenue for payouts has been discussed before, including in August 2025. Here's everything to know about the suggested $2,000 IRS stimulus check and whether you will be getting it before Christmas. What are IRS Stimulus checks? Stimulus checks are direct federal payments issued during economic downturns to support households and encourage spending. The last nationwide payments were sent in 2021 under the American Rescue Plan, offering up to $1,400 per person. No new federal stimulus checks have been approved since, despite widespread online claims. Are we getting a $2,000 stimulus check before Christmas? Not yet. As of mid-November 2025, Congress has not approved any new federal stimulus checks, and the IRS says no additional payments are scheduled for this year. The proposed $2,000 “tariff dividend” checks were suggested by Donald Trump and could arrive around mid-2026, but the plan remains unapproved and is not currently guaranteed. IRS caution on stimulus check Since no new stimulus program has been approved, no one is eligible for a payment unless Congress passes a law. If a payment isn’t reflected in your official IRS account or confirmed by an IRS notice, it is likely not legitimate. The IRS also warns that unsolicited texts or emails about payments are often scams. FAQs Is the IRS sending a new $2,000 stimulus check in 2025? No. As of mid-November 2025, there are no new stimulus check IRS payments scheduled, and Congress has not approved additional federal stimulus funding. What is Donald Trump’s proposed $2,000 stimulus check IRS plan? Trump has proposed issuing $2,000 “tariff dividend” stimulus check IRS payments to middle-income Americans using tariff revenue, but the plan has not been passed into law and remains only a proposal. How can I verify if a stimulus check IRS payment is real? A legitimate stimulus check IRS payment will appear in your official IRS online account and be accompanied by an IRS notice. Messages received through text, email, or social media claiming you are owed money are often scams.

"It all began with an anonymous Twitter handle named “Ivan the K.” The self-appointed “Lead Independent Director of Finance Twitter” had a dark theory in the depths of the pandemic. In 2020, they asked the universe, “Why is no one talking about a K recovery?” since there was much discussion at that time about an economic bounceback in the shape of either a U, an L, or, most bullish of all, a V. “Some things will bounce back,” Ivan wrote, “some will not recover. Think about it.” Economists seem to have thunk on it and agreed: The K is real. It bears similarities to another saying, invented nearly 200 years earlier by the great English romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley: “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.” This is also called “the Matthew effect,” as some trace the sentiment all the way back to the bible’s Book of Matthew 25:29: “For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.” If you ask Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, this old-time religion got a new lease on life in the Reaganomics of the 1980s. “You really start to see this in the Reagan era,” Zandi told Fortune. “That’s when you get a structural divergence between productivity growth and median wage growth.” Zandi argued that many elements combined then to weaken labor in favor of capital income: globalization, the decline of unions and manufacturing and major tax reforms. “The share of national income going to labor has been trending down since the early 1980s,” he said, “and the share going to capital owners—those who already have wealth—has gone up.” So what is it about 2025, five years after the pandemic severed something economically, that accelerated both sides of the “K” for the wealthy and the poor? Data don’t lie First, consider the extraordinary surges in economic data seen, halfway through the 2020s. The stock market rallies have led to several record highs in 2025, incentivizing the (wealthier) Americans with money in the markets to loosen their purse strings. But the bottom half of the K is extending downwards, with fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle and Cava, and fast-food joints like McDonald’s, noting that lower-income customers, especially young people, are pulling back and preferring to dine at home. Zandi’s own research has turned up some stunning results, notably that in the second quarter of 2025 the top 10% of wealthiest Americans were responsible for a whopping 49% of consumer spending. That means the economy has grown so lopsided—or K-shaped—that the richest Americans are responsible for half the economy. The K-shape is creating the illusion in economic data that despite sticky inflation and tariff-related sticker shock, consumer spending remains “resilient.” Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Lisa Shalett has increasingly been sounding the alarm from her perch as chief investment officer. She told Fortune in an October interview that “the income inequality stuff is really getting like completely wackadoo,” specifically citing Zandi’s research: “That means 90% of the country is only half the consumption, I mean holy cannoli.” Shalett covered the K-shaped economy specifically in a November 3 research note, in the context of whether 2026 marks an early or late stage of the economic cycle for investors. “Decoding this conundrum may hinge on the so-called K-shaped economy,” she wrote, “a concept that captures the widening chasm between the ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots.’” Then Shalett said the situation is actually even worse than what Zandi produced: “For the U.S. consumer, wealth concentration has produced a situation where the top 40% of households by income account for approximately 60% of all spending; those households, in turn, control nearly 85% of America’s wealth, two-thirds of which is directly tied to the stock market, which has climbed more than 90% in three years.” She calculated that spending by the wealthiest households was growing 6x-7x faster than for the lowest cohort. Even Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell talked about seeing the pattern at October’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. “If you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big, public, consumer-facing companies, many of them are saying that there’s a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower cost products,” Powell said last week. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.” When did the K-shaped economy emerge? The concept of a bifurcated economy has been baked into American society longer than even the days of Reagan, according to Tyler Schipper, associate professor of economics at the University of St. Thomas. “There’s this underlying thing that has been true for decades and decades and decades,” Schipper told Fortune. “Number one, lower income households always struggle more in the economy. They tend to be more impacted by price changes because they’re spending a higher percentage of their income. “And second, that it tends to be that after each recession, lower income workers fall further behind in the income distribution,” he added. Today, conversations around the shape of the American economy are more urgent because more of the middle class—and those making about $100,000 per year—are getting pushed into the lower half of the K, Schipper said. This can be seen in mid-income and higher-income earners flocking to discount retailers like Walmart and Dollar General. It can even take on more absurd forms, with “Ralph Lauren Christmas” trending at unprecedented levels heading into the projected $1 trillion 2025 holiday season, but TikTok and Instagram full of tips on how to achieve the look of red-tartan-plaid and cozy sweaters on a budget—in other words, not at an actually expensive Ralph Lauren store. Why is this happening? That lower half of the K is extending ever downward as the consumer encounters a unique set of challenges, including the inflationary impact of tariffs, according to Schipper. Lower-income households tend to spend more on essential goods more likely to be impacted by tariffs. The Yale Budget Lab calculated that the levies impact the bottom of the income ladder more than three times more than the top. A low-fire, low-hire labor market has also contributed to evidence of a two-tiered economy, said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Federal Reserve economist. While tech layoffs have been top of mind following massive cuts from Amazon, layoff rates are still low, Sahm told Fortune, meaning if you have a job, you may feel more financially secure. If you’re just entering the job market like Gen Z is, you may have a hard time finding a job as firms contract following a post-COVID hiring spree, and as AI begins to displace entry-level jobs. To be sure, data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas released on Thursday found U.S. employers cut more than 150,000 jobs last month, the largest October reduction in two decades. But another part of the resurgence of discussions about a bifurcated economy comes from the relative nature of a K-shaped economy, according to Schipper. While the economy has historically been two-tiered, diverging consumer sentiment has also contributed to a narrative that two income groups are moving away from each other. For example, in 2022 when the stock market declined, consumer sentiment in both the top-third and bottom-third of income levels converged, according to data from the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers. A similar pattern occurred in April, when the announcement of Liberation Day tariffs spooked Americans across income levels, Schipper noted. Last month, however, consumer attitude toward the economy saw a greater split, with low-income Americans feeling far less confident about the economy than those high-income. How monetary policy created the two-tiered economy Some economists point to the widening divide between the rich and the poor as a consequence of monetary policy. The Fed, over the past few years, has had a historic tightening cycle – eleven rate hikes between 2022 and 2024—which was meant to pare down inflation. However, it also reinforced the split since wealthy households, flush by years of asset appreciation, could weather the slowdown better than lower income households facing higher mortgage rates and shrinking credit, Zandi said. Cheap money in the 2010s and early pandemic years boosted stocks and home values, but the 2022-and-on tightening squeezed borrowers and renters without necessarily reversing those gains. That means even as inflation has cooled, the damage lingered as asset holders retained their windfall but wage earners bore the brunt of disinflation. “Folks in the top third of the income and wealth distribution are doing well, but the remaining two-thirds of Americans are struggling… they borrowed during the pandemic when rates were low, and now they’re having to pay on that debt at a higher rate,” Zandi said. How can the economy become less bifurcated? Though Fed chair Powell has acknowledged today’s K-shaped economy, a restrictive monetary policy is helping keep it in place, Sahm argued, making it unlikely for the two diverging K lines to come any closer together. “We have a Fed that’s still trying to fight inflation that’s been elevated, and part of the tool that they have for fighting inflation is interest rates are elevated, and they’ve been elevated for some time,” Sahm said. “This is the way restrictive monetary policy works: It’s going to hit households hardest who are more financially constrained.” Zandi had a different perspective. He argued that the gap will require policy changes far beyond the Fed’s remit. “The Fed can’t fix the K-shaped economy,” he said. “It can only stabilize prices and employment. The distributional effects are up to fiscal policy.” Instead, Zandi argued for a reversal of some choices made on the fiscal side that would “do no harm” to lower-and-middle-income Americans. “Don’t impose tariffs—that exacerbates inequality,” he said. “Lower- and middle-income households spend a much higher share of their budget on imported products like food, clothing, and cars.” He also criticized President Donald Trump’s “highly restrictive” immigration policy, which he said hurts jobs for industries that rely on immigrants, such as construction, agriculture and manufacturing broadly. Beyond just addressing self-inflicting wounds, Zandi argued that progress depends on both structural and cyclical forces: raising productivity through education, broad-based jobs creation, and ensuring that gains from AI will be equally shared. “If the benefits of AI are distributed more broadly,” he said, “and if job losses are offset by new opportunities, we’ll be fine.” What’s so bad about a K-shaped economy? Clear evidence of a two-tiered economy doesn’t mean a recession is imminent, economists said. It does, however, mean that if economic indicators were to take a nosedive, the risk of a recession would increase. “The K-shaped economy, the bifurcated economy, is potentially a more vulnerable economy,” Sahm said. Though layoff rates are still relatively low, if the rate of job cuts increased, there would be many more people in a job market where there’s not much hiring. The labor market today doesn’t look like it did in the job-hopping era of 2023, even when interest rates were still high, Sahm noted. Right now, only the healthcare and hospitality sectors are adding jobs in earnest, creating a concentration of growth not optimal for economic stability. “Anytime you have that, you’re more vulnerable if something bad happens,” Sahm said.",right
"Dunkin’ Donuts has come under fire this week from customers after its alleged ‘new’ ice policy was revealed in a social media post. On Monday, an anonymous Facebook user shared a picture of a paper displaying alleged pour directions for a variety of coffee and other beverage orders in the Dunkin’ World Facebook group, which has over 550,000 members. The photo shows that an assortment of iced drinks—lattes and signature lattes, macchiatos, matchas, chais, cappuccinos, and Americanos—and other drinks including shakin’ espressos, should never be filled to the top of a cup, and that for these orders the same amount of drink should be poured regardless of if the customer asks for less or no ice. Instead, those drinks should be filled to the ice line, which is signified by three red squares, on a Dunkin’ cup, the alleged company instructions to baristas show. When customers ask for less ice for those drinks, the ice should be filled to the second red line on a cup. The Facebook user that posted the picture claimed the paper showed a new Dunkin’ policy, but it remains unconfirmed if the policy is indeed new—or if it is a company policy at all. Some commenters, who claim they are Dunkin’ workers, said the instructions were real. Dunkin’ did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. The instructions advise to fill a cup to the top with no ice for a Dunkin’ Refresher, Dunkin’ Energy, or Iced Tea Lemonade. “These beverages use measurements that account for ice in the cup,” the instructions read. “When made in the cup without ice, the ingredient ratios will be wrong and the beverage will not taste right. We do not recommend building these beverages with no ice.” Some users have criticized the U.S.’s second-largest coffee chain for the instructions. “Just paid $6+ for a large cookie butter cloud latte, with less ice, to not get filled to the top because their new fill policy says they will not do it, on purpose,” the original poster said. “Sending to everyone so that they are aware what they will be receiving.” Other commenters said baristas will fill the cups to the top if customers ask, but will also charge extra for the extra pour, since less or no ice doesn’t necessarily equate to more product. Wholesale coffee bean costs have risen over the past year since new tariffs were placed on countries including Brazil, which is the primary supplier for the U.S. market. This pushed up wholesale bean costs and led coffee chains to increase consumer prices by 15%-20%. But President Donald Trump has recently been seeking to answer attacks on affordability and cost of living, while claiming that the economy is in a “golden age” and affordability isn’t real whenever Democrats criticize him for it. However, his administration said this month that they are reversing some tariffs—including those on coffee—to bring down prices. Starbucks and Dunkin’ collectively control about 85% of the U.S. coffee market measured by sales, The Wall Street Journalreported earlier this month, citing data from Morgan Stanley. Still, the dominant coffee chains are losing some ground to relatively newer brands like Dutch Bros., which caters more to a Gen Z customer base with customizable drinks and eye-catching creations often posted on Instagram and TikTok, analysts told The Journal.",right
"Why Are We Sleeping on China’s AI Invasion? When Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky recently admitted his company is “relying a lot” on Chinese AI models because they’re “very good…fast and cheap,” it should have set off alarm bells in Washington. Here’s a CEO choosing Alibaba’s Qwen over his friend Sam Altman’s OpenAI—not because of superior technology, but because Chinese AI is dramatically cheaper. According to Bloomberg columnist Catherine Thorbecke, Alibaba’s Qwen has racked up roughly 385 million cumulative downloads on Hugging Face, surpassing Meta’s Llama at 346 million. Chinese AI models now account for more than 40 percent of new language models being built, while Meta’s share has collapsed to around 15 percent. Thorbecke also reports that U.S. coding startups valued at $10 billion, such as Cursor and Cognition AI, appear to be running on Chinese AI foundations—though those companies haven’t confirmed it. Meanwhile, in China, try to access ChatGPT or Claude. You can’t. The Cyberspace Administration of China has approved over a hundred AI models for public use—every one domestically developed and none from American firms, according to Chinese state media and regulatory filings. U.S. AI products are effectively barred from the Chinese market through a combination of the Great Firewall and regulatory requirements. That’s textbook trade asymmetry: China has erected an impenetrable wall against American AI companies while Chinese AI services freely access American customers and developers. And we’re letting it happen. (iStock/Getty Images)Washington has responded with a flurry of proposals—all of them missing the point. The “No Adversarial AI Act” would ban U.S. government agencies from using Chinese AI. Senator Josh Hawley’s bill would criminalize Americans working on Chinese AI research. While many of these measures deserve support, they are either narrowly targeted at government procurement or focused on preventing collaboration and investment in the Chinese AI companies. But none of them address the core problem: American companies are freely purchasing Chinese AI services while Chinese companies have zero ability to purchase American AI services, even if they wanted to. That’s exactly the sort of one-way trade barrier that President Donald Trump has promised to end. Moderate Reciprocity in AI Now The case for action is straightforward. First, there’s the reciprocity principle. Whatever China imposes on us, we should impose on it. If China blocks American AI from its market, we should block—or at least tariff—Chinese AI from ours. Second, Chinese AI companies benefit from heavy state subsidies that allow them to undercut American competitors on price. As venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya recently said on the All-In podcast, Chinese AI is “frankly just a ton cheaper than OpenAI and Anthropic.” That price gap reflects Beijing’s industrial policy, not market efficiency. A tariff would level the playing field by forcing American purchasers to internalize those hidden subsidies. Third, there are legitimate national security concerns about what American companies feed into Chinese AI systems—systems that Beijing can access under Chinese law. A tariff makes companies pay for that security risk rather than socializing it. Now, let’s be clear about what true reciprocity would require: a complete ban. China doesn’t just restrict American AI—it prohibits it entirely. The reciprocal response would be to prohibit American citizens and businesses from using any Chinese AI products, period. But we can start with something more moderate: a substantial tariff on Chinese AI services. This approach has several advantages. Unlike a ban, it generates revenue rather than simply cutting off commerce. It lets market forces work—companies can still choose Chinese AI if the price advantage remains compelling even after the tariff. And it’s consistent with the broader Trump administration approach to trade policy. The mechanism is straightforward. When American companies pay for Chinese AI services—whether through API calls, subscription fees, or commercial licenses—that’s a taxable transaction. Enforcement would follow the same framework as any other imported digital service. Critics will argue this makes American companies less competitive globally. This is the line they used for a generation as we gave away our industrial base to China. Doing it once was foolishness. Allowing it to happen twice, this time with AI, would be treason. The real question is whether we’re serious about defending American AI leadership. We can’t simultaneously complain about China’s industrial policy while giving Chinese AI companies unrestricted access to American buyers. It’s time to practice what we preach about reciprocity.

"Apple’s board of directors and senior executives have been accelerating succession plans for Tim Cook, sources told the Financial Times. After serving as CEO for 14 years, Cook may step down as early as next year, the report said. Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering, 50-year-old John Ternus, is widely seen as the most likely successor, but no final decisions have been made yet, sources told the FT. The engineer joined Apple’s product design team in 2001 and has overseen hardware engineering for most major products the tech company has launched ever since, according to Ternus’ LinkedIn profile. He has also played a prominent role during Apple’s most recent keynotes, introducing products like the new iPhone Air. Ternus had been rumored to be Cook’s potential successor, according to previous reports. The company is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, and an early-year announcement would allow a new leadership team time to settle in before its annual events, the FT said. The succession preparations have been long-planned and are not related to the company’s current performance, which is expecting strong end-of-year sales, people close to Apple told the FT. Apple did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment and declined to provide a comment to the FT. The $4 trillion company is expecting year-on-year revenue growth of 10% to 12% for its holiday quarter ending in December, fueled by the release of the iPhone 17 model in September. Ternus would take the helm of the tech giant at an important time in its evolution. Although Apple has seen sales success with iPhones and new products like Airpods over the past couple of decades, it has struggled to break into AI and keep up with rivals. Instead, Apple has even spending significantly less in AI investments compared to Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Apple has been criticized by analysts this year for not having a clear AI strategy. And despite approving a multibillion-dollar budget to run its own models via the cloud in 2026, it was reported in June that Apple is even considering using models from OpenAI and Anthropic to power its updated version of Siri, rather than using technology the company has built in-house. Its AI-enabled Siri, originally slated for 2025, will be delayed until 2026 or later due to a series of technical challenges, the company announced earlier this year. Apple has also lost a number of senior AI team members since January, many of whom have joined Meta’s AI and Superintelligence Labs during talent poaching wars this year. The exodus of Apple’s AI execs included Ruoming Pang, former head of Apple’s foundation models and core generative AI team, who joined Meta with a compensation package reportedly worth $200 million. The company is also dealing with increased competition from one of its most influential former employees. In May, Sam Altman’s OpenAI acquired startup io for about $6.5 billion, bringing in former Apple chief designer Jony Ive to build AI devices. The 58-year-old designer was instrumental in creating the iPhone, iPod, and iPad. Cook, Apple’s former operations chief, turned 65 this month. He has grown the company’s market capitalization to $4 trillion from $350 billion in 2011, when he took over the CEO role from company co-founder Steve Jobs. Under Cook, Apple became the first publicly traded company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2018—then it became the first company to reach $3 trillion in market cap in 2022. But more recently, its stock price has been lagging behind Big Tech rivals Alphabet, Nvidia, and Microsoft, though Apple is trading close to an all-time high after strong earnings were reported in October. Apple has also dealt with tariff complications as U.S.-China trade tensions have disrupted its supply chain. Cook has previously said he’d prefer an internal candidate to replace him, adding that the company has “very detailed succession plans.” “I really want the person to come from within Apple,” Cook told singer Dua Lipa last year on her podcastAt Your Service.",right
"Korea Says Fact Sheet With US on Trade, Security Finalized South Korea and the US signed a formal trade deal, giving Seoul’s automakers and chipmakers greater certainty over their export plans while also deepening defense cooperation and bringing the two longtime allies even closer. (Bloomberg) — South Korea and the US signed a formal trade deal, giving Seoul’s automakers and chipmakers greater certainty over their export plans while also deepening defense cooperation and bringing the two longtime allies even closer. Earlier in the day, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said a joint fact sheet outlining trade and security terms agreed with the US was finalized. “The trade negotiations and security consultations between South Korea and the US — one of the most critical variables for our economy and national security — have been officially concluded,” Lee told reporters in a briefing Friday. The MOU, which concludes months of negotiations, builds on an earlier agreement reached during President Donald Trump’s visit to South Korea late last month. The deal includes a $350 billion facility meant to channel Korean investment into strategic US industries including shipbuilding, energy and semiconductors. South Korea also committed to buy $25 billion in US military equipment by 2030 and contribute $33 billion in support for US Forces Korea, according to a statement released by the White House. The US will apply a 15% tariff cap on imports of Korean goods, including autos and pharmaceuticals. While auto duties will be lowered from the current 25%, the new rate remains well above the 2.5% Korea previously enjoyed under the free trade agreement. On semiconductors, the US pledged to offer Korea terms “no less favorable” than those extended to other major trading partners. The US also plans to remove supplemental tariffs imposed under executive orders on select products such as generic drugs, their ingredients and precursors, and certain natural resources not produced domestically. Tariffs will likewise be eliminated on specific aircraft and parts from South Korea that were previously covered by a separate executive order. Read also: US, South Korea Finalize Deal on Investments, Lower Tariff Rate Lee stressed that the investments would be limited to commercially viable projects, explicitly addressing public concerns that the package could amount to aid or generate unrecoverable losses. The US also agreed to cap Korean dollar outflows at $20 billion annually, with flexibility to adjust timing if needed, to prevent currency market instability, the joint fact sheet showed. The agreement also includes enforcement mechanisms that could raise costs for Korea if it fails to meet capital-call deadlines. Should Seoul miss a scheduled payment, the US would temporarily collect the interest Korea is entitled to until the unpaid amount is covered, and tariffs could be raised above the agreed 15% threshold, Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan told reporters Friday. To finance projects in the US, the Korean government plans to establish a dedicated fund through a special law that will allow it to raise foreign currency without destabilizing markets. Rather than purchasing dollars directly onshore, the fund is expected to rely on returns from existing foreign-currency assets or issue foreign-currency bonds, Kim said. Officials seek to submit the bill next week, which will also define the fund’s governance, funding structure and operating rules. A central “investment special purpose vehicle” will manage individual projects, pooling risk so that losses in any single project can be offset by gains in others. Profits will be shared 50:50 until the principal and interest are fully repaid. After repayment, returns will be distributed at a 90:10 ratio in favor of the US, with room for adjustment if full repayment appears unlikely within 20 years, the MOU showed. Project selection will take place through the end of Trump’s term in January 2029, and funding for projects must be provided no less than 45 business days after Korea receives formal notice from the US regarding the investment target, Kim said. On security, Lee also confirmed that the two nations agreed to move forward with the construction of a nuclear-powered submarine, a decades-long strategic goal for Seoul. South Korea also secured US backing to expand its rights related to uranium enrichment and spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, he added. The US reaffirmed its extended deterrence commitment, including nuclear capabilities, and welcomed Seoul’s pledge to raise defense spending to 3.5% of gross domestic product. The fact sheet was released more than two weeks after the two countries agreed to finalize the deal. Acknowledging the delay, Lee said intense debate took place with regards to the precise wording, given the gravity of the issues involved. Nuclear fuel enrichment, reprocessing, and the submarine agreement were particularly sensitive, he noted. “This was a matter that could determine our national fate, and for that reason, we could not afford to treat even a single word or clause lightly,” Lee said. “It was a negotiation of great importance — one that came with many difficulties and obstacles.” —With assistance from Seyoon Kim and Soo-Hyang Choi.

"Merz Backs EU Tariff Plan to Help Europe's Ailing Steelmakers German Chancellor Friedrich Merz threw his support behind proposed European Union tariffs to shield the continent’s ailing steelmakers and reiterated his government’s commitment to securing steel production and jobs in Europe’s biggest economy. (Bloomberg) — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz threw his support behind proposed European Union tariffs to shield the continent’s ailing steelmakers and reiterated his government’s commitment to securing steel production and jobs in Europe’s biggest economy. After talks Thursday with industry executives and labor officials in Berlin, the conservative leader’s ruling coalition also called for an immediate halt to steel imports from Russia as part of EU sanctions against Moscow and reiterated support for the European Commission’s efforts for “rapid relief” from US tariffs on steel and aluminum. That should allow European products to be exported to America “duty-free as far as possible via an appropriate tariff quota,” according to an emailed statement. “Our aim is not simply to preserve the steel industry, but also to support it in positioning itself successfully for the future,” Merz said, flanked by Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil. “Only with competitive companies will we be able to secure productivity and jobs in the steel industry in the long term,” he added. “We need a little bit more patriotism, a little bit more ‘Buy European here’,” Klingbeil said. The European Commission last month proposed 50% tariffs — twice the current rate — on all steel imports above a quota that will be cut by roughly 45%. The move by the EU’s executive arm is a response to mounting fears that traditional European industries are no longer able to compete on global terms, choked by a glut of subsidized Chinese products, high energy prices and dwindling local demand. EU member states and the European Parliament must still approve the proposal. German backing represents a reversal of its traditional aversion to trade barriers and reflects the new global reality under protectionist US President Donald Trump. Once a pillar of the nation’s postwar industrial might, Germany’s steel industry has been in long-term decline as high labor and energy costs render domestic production increasingly uncompetitive. A push to decarbonize has added further strain, with costly investments in “green steel” undermined by limited access to cheap renewable power, a contrast to regions like Scandinavia or the Middle East where wind and solar are abundant. Merz said his government will intensify efforts to cut energy costs and will give domestic green steel producers preferential treatment on procurement contracts. Meanwhile, Asian mills continue to churn out excess steel, keeping global prices low and eroding margins for European producers. Thyssenkrupp AG, Germany’s largest steelmaker which was represented at Thursday’s Berlin meeting, has been trying for years to shed its steel division, a business that rarely earns its cost of capital over a full cycle. Russia’s war on Ukraine sent energy prices soaring, further battering the sector, while structural shifts such as the steady decline of German carmaking — once a major steel buyer — have curbed demand. Although Berlin’s defense buildup may offer a modest lift in orders for armor plate used in tanks and warships, many mills have already shuttered their heavy plate production after years of losses, underscoring how far German steelmaking has fallen from its 20th-century peak. Merz’s government is introducing a new mechanism for easing electricity costs for energy-intensive industries, though most steel producers won’t benefit as they already receive a power subsidy. EU competition rules prevent companies receiving multiple subsidies. In the emailed statement, the government said exemptions in the current sanctions regime are allowing Russia to export some steel products to the EU in “significant quantities.” “The German government will therefore continue to work intensively to end these existing exemptions as quickly as possible,” according to the statement. “All attempts to circumvent the sanctions will be prosecuted and punished even more rigorously.” More broadly, the ruling coalition hopes its economic policies will help halt the precipitous trend of de-industrialization. Germany has shed roughly 250,000 industrial jobs since the Covid-19 pandemic, according to consultancy Ernst & Young. More cuts are planned, with parts maker Robert Bosch GmbH recently announcing a further 13,000 job losses, a fresh blow to the country’s flagship automotive sector. —With assistance from Petra Sorge and Jenni Thier.

"It’s no coincidence that Bitcoin’s collapsing price has coincided with signs of President Donald Trump’s diminishing political power, according to Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize–winning economist and professor of economics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Fresh off its all-time high of $126,000 last month, Bitcoin has been in free fall for the past month, sitting at about $87,000 as of Wednesday after falling to a six-month low of about $81,000 last week. Cryptocurrency’s broader $1 trillion selloff has even cost the Trump family—with its ample ventures in crypto—$1 billion of its fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. To Krugman, formerly an outspoken and longtime New York Times columnist, Bitcoin’s latest rout is an indication that Trump has lost his edge. Krugman notes that Trump has long been friendly to the crypto industry, in addition to having significant investments in the sector. “How should we understand Bitcoin’s recent crash? Think of it as the unraveling of the Trump trade,” Krugman said in a Substack post on Monday. “Trump remains as determined as ever to reward the industry that made his family rich, and those around him are as determined as ever to make America safe for predators of all kinds. “But Trump’s power is visibly diminishing, so the price of Bitcoin, which has in effect become a bet on Trumpism, has plunged,” he added. Krugman’s argument of a ‘Trump trade’ collapse Krugman, who has made no secret of his contempt for cryptocurrencies (or for Trump and Trumpism), argues their rise is inextricably linked with the Trump administration’s raft of friendly policies and actions toward crypto investors and exchanges. That includes calling for the creation of a government Bitcoin reserve, as well as signing an executive order in August to allow U.S. citizens to invest retirement savings in cryptocurrency, as well as other alternative assets. Last month, Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty in 2023 to violating U.S. money laundering laws while CEO of the crypto exchange. Trump himself holds an estimated $870 million in Bitcoin, making him one of the largest investors in the currency, and his family has grown its own crypto empire over the past few years. In September, American Bitcoin, a Bitcoin mining company backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., began trading on the Nasdaq and notched a $5 billion valuation in its debut. A Fortune analysis published in March found Trump’s crypto holdings made up about $3 billion of his net worth. Trump’s broader policy moves have been correlated with past crypto selloffs, including last month, when a crash coincided with the president weighing an additional 100% tariff on China. But lately, Krugman noted, Trump’s partisan influence has wavered, evidenced by near-unanimous bipartisan support for the release of the Epstein files, as well as waning Republican approval for the president’s handling of the economy following growing concern over a “K-shaped economy.” That’s on top of blowout Democratic victories at the polls, including the election of democratic socialist mayors in New York and Seattle. In Krugman’s eyes, these election defeats and increased scrutiny of Trump’s handling of the economy loosen Republicans’ willingness to show “lockstep obedience” with the president. He cites blogger and journalist Josh Marshall, who has posited that “power is unitary,” or that weakness in any part of the president’s image translates to an overall perception of weakness, which extends to his influence in the crypto sector. “A weakened Trump is less able to work his will on all fronts, including his efforts to promote crypto,” Krugman said. To be sure, Krugman may be generous in how much credit he gives Trump for his control over cryptocurrency, which operates in its own environment, only adjacent to whomever holds political power. White House spokesperson Kush Desai said the Trump administration is implementing policies meant to help cryptocurrency prosper and rebuked the idea that non-policy factors in Trump’s presidency would have the ability to move the price of Bitcoin. “Only a moron would ignore these policies and attribute price fluctuations for a privately traded cryptocurrency to noneconomic matters concerning the president,” Desai told Fortune in a statement.",right
"Descartes' Study Finds 67% of Freight Forwarders and Customs Brokers View Technology as Fundamental to Growth Automation and AI emerge as critical differentiators for logistics services providers facing global instability, tariff volatility and cost pressures LONDON and ATLANTA, Nov. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Descartes Systems Group (Nasdaq:DSGX) (TSX:DSG), the global leader in uniting logistics-intensive businesses in commerce, announced the results of its Global Forwarder/Broker Benchmark Study of more than 400 companies, highlighting a logistics industry navigating global uncertainty and technological opportunity. According to the study, global instability (60%), tariff changes (42%) and customer pricing pressure (61%) are among the most significant challenges freight forwarders and customs brokers expect to face over the next five years. In the face of these headwinds, however, 67% of respondents viewed technology as fundamental or highly important to growth, and an overwhelming 55% cited implementing new technologies as the top strategy to grow over competitors (see Figure 1). Figure 1: What strategies are expected to help differentiate your organization from and grow over competitors? Source: Descartes Respondents viewed the ability to leverage automation and artificial intelligence (AI) as vital to achieving long-term efficiency, compliance agility and profitability. AI (65%) was cited as the technology expected to deliver the greatest value to organizations over the next two years. While many traditional technologies experienced a decline in perceived value, both rate management (20%) and regulatory compliance systems (30%) showed gains in 2025 (see Figure 2). Rate management solutions have grown in importance for the ability to deliver automated, self-service rating and quoting capabilities to customers, while the value of regulatory compliance systems has increased given the complexities of meeting quickly evolving regulatory demands. Figure 2. What technologies are expected to deliver the greatest value to your organization over the next 2 years? Source: Descartes Other key findings include: - Manual processes hinder growth: 25% cited manual workflows as the top inhibitor to growth, with smaller companies especially constrained by limited access to capital (27%). - AI dominates technology investment: 55% of respondents plan to prioritize AI investment over the next two years. - Competitive edge shifting: Tailored services (33%) overtook high service (31%) as the top competitive advantage, signaling a move toward more customized and data-driven customer experiences. - Importance of technology diverges by company size: While 60% of large companies view technology as fundamental to growth, only 27% of small companies share that view. “Over the nine editions of the study, the role of technology has changed significantly for freight forwarders and customs brokers—from streamlining back-office operations, to enabling digital customer engagement, to harnessing intelligent automation,” said Scott Sangster, General Manager, Logistics Services Providers at Descartes. “This shift is mirrored in the industry’s IT investment priorities, which have evolved in step with technological maturity: from technology for efficiency in 2019–2020, digitization in 2021–2022 and now intelligence and automation through 2025. While forwarders and brokers are facing unprecedented global trade volatility today, many organizations remain optimistic about technology’s potential to help redefine their future.” Descartes surveyed 434 freight forwarders and customs brokers across North America, EMEA, APAC and Latin America, including Descartes customers, industry publication readers and members of seven trade associations: Airforwarders Association (AfA), Association of International Customs and Border Agencies (AICBA), British International Freight Association (BIFA), Canadian International Freight Forwarders Association (CIFFA), European Association for Forwarding, Transport, Logistics and Customs Services (CLECAT), International Federation of Freight Forwarders Association (FIATA), National Customs Brokers & Forwarders Association of America (NCBFAA). The goal was to gain a comprehensive look at the forces shaping the logistics industry from a diverse group of global logistics professionals. The study examines key economic, regulatory and industry trends creating new challenges while also highlighting the strategies, tactics and technologies companies are using to adapt and drive growth. It explores the competitive landscape, areas of technology investments and the impact of emerging technologies, such as AI, on the industry’s future.

"Investor angst over Big Tech's AI spending spills into bond market Debt issued by groups building data centres has been hit in recent weeks Investors have been selling off the debt of U.S. tech heavyweights, showing how jitters over Silicon Valley‘s boom in spending on artificial intelligence have spilled into the bond market. A basket of bonds issued by so-called hyperscalers — companies that are building vast data centres, including Alphabet Inc,, Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. — has sustained a hit in recent weeks. The spread, or premium in yield investors demand to buy the debt over Treasuries, has climbed to 0.78 percentage points, the highest level since U.S. President Donald Trump sent markets reeling in April with his tariff plans, and up from 0.5 points in September, according to Bank of America data. The widening spread highlights how investors are increasingly concerned with the way tech groups are turning to debt markets to finance their investments in AI infrastructure. “The important thing the market woke up to in the past two weeks is that it’s the public markets that are going to need to finance this AI boom,” said Brij Khurana, a fixed income portfolio manager at Wellington Management. JPMorgan on Monday said building AI infrastructure will cost more than US$5 trillion and “will likely require participation from every public capital market as well as private credit, alternative capital providers and even government involvement”. The mammoth scale of investment in AI infrastructure has raised concerns about overcapacity, long-term profitability and energy demands. Google, Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft and Meta will spend more than US$400 billion on data centres in 2026, on top of more than US$350 billion this year. - Data centres in Nvidia's hometown stand empty - Amazon’s jump puts stock back in AI conversation - Advertisement 1Story continues below Tech giants are issuing debt at a quick rate to fund their AI expansion efforts despite having large cash hoards, something some investors worry could signal a shift to higher levels of leverage. “The hyperscalers collectively hold (about) US$350 billon in liquid cash and investments and are expected to generate (roughly) US$725 billion of operating cash flow in 2026,” JPMorgan said. “Even so, substantial new debt supply is coming to the credit markets from these high-quality issuers.” In recent weeks, Meta, Alphabet and Oracle have hit markets with blockbuster debt packages, some with maturities as long as 40 years. Meta last month forged a US$27 billion private debt deal with investors including Pimco and Blue Owl Capital to fund development of its “Hyperion” data centre in Louisiana. It raised an additional $30bn in bonds at the end of October, the biggest corporate bond deal since 2023. Meanwhile, Alphabet sold US$25 billion of bonds in early November, US$17.5 billion of which were raised in the U.S. and US$7.5 billion in Europe. Oracle sold US$18 billion of bonds in September to fund infrastructure leases such as OpenAI’s “Stargate” data centre in Abilene, Texas. Analysts noted Oracle’s debt has been hit particularly hard in recent months. An index compiled by the Financial Times tracking its debt that has been trading since before the latest bond sale has fallen nearly five per cent since mid-September, compared to a price fall of about 1 per cent for a broad Ice Data Services basket tracking U.S. high-grade tech debt. Oracle has about US$96 billion of long-term debt, according to Bloomberg data. It has rapidly grown its debt balances as part of a series of deals to lease computing power to ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which the U.S. software group said would generate US$300 billion in revenue over the next 5 years. But credit rating agency Moody’s has flagged significant risks from Oracle relying on large commitments from a small number of AI companies to fund its growth. Some analysts argue the decline in hyperscalers’ bonds in the wake of such large issuance is healthy. “As long as we are still pricing incremental risk, it’s a good sign. The thing I worry about is a rally on more supply rather than a sell-off,” said George Pearkes, a macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group. “We’re still in early innings in this debt cycle for AI,” he said. © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"“Bust or boom?” That’s the big question at the heart of UBS’ big forecast for the U.S. economy for 2026 through 2028. But the team led by economist Jonathan Pingle also tackles a question that economists have been raising throughout 2025: the fact that tariffs amount to a large tax increase in all but name. Their analysis finds that the tariffs are acting as a substantial drag on growth and are actively contributing to persistent inflation, eroding real income gains for consumers. “The tariffs are a big tax increase,” the report states simply. According to UBS, the current tariff policies imply a weighted-average tariff rate of 13.6%, based on 2024 import shares, a fivefold jump from just 2.5% at the beginning of the year. This steep rate effectively translates to a tax on imports representing 1.2% of GDP. The most immediate impact of the trade regime is felt in rising prices, which are “keeping things elevated.” UBS estimates that the new trade regime will add 0.8 percentage points to core PCE inflation in 2026, enough to erase a year’s worth of disinflation progress and keep prices climbing at roughly 3.5% even if other pressures like housing or energy ease. Over the longer term, UBS expects the tariffs to have a cumulative direct impact of 1.4 percentage points on the level of core PCE through 2028, rising to nearly 1.9 points once knock-on effects like supply chain rerouting and domestic producers raising prices under tariff protection are factored in. Simply: tariffs alone could account for nearly two-thirds of the remaining gap between current inflation and the Fed’s 2% target. Inflationary Headwinds Hit Households This tariff-related price pass-through is already translating into pressure on American households. With average hourly earnings growth having slowed to roughly 3.5% annualized over the past six months, and aggregate payroll income running at about 3.25% annualized, this inflationary surge is proving costly. Economists expect quarterly annualized PCE inflation to run between 3% and 4% over the next two quarters, effectively wiping out those income gains. The report highlights that most households are less able to weather inflation now than they were two years ago. While upper-income households are supported by AI-driven equity market wealth, households below the top 20% of the income distribution suffer from historically low liquid assets. Rising costs, coupled with a slowing labor market, are diminishing consumer perceptions of future prospects. This headwind is particularly concerning because the U.S. economic expansion is already characterized as “narrowly driven” and “precarious.” The current economic outlook is essentially described as “a big bet on AI,” where the only obvious areas of growth are investment in software and computers (AI-driven) and consumption supported by upper-income equity market wealth. “A decent chunk of the US economy is in recession,” UBS adds, including real residential investment and non-residential construction, is in recession or declining outright. Returning money back to the people? As inflation pressures mount, President Donald Trump is touting his tariffs not only as a shield for American industry but also as a new source of household income. He has floated the idea of a “tariff dividend”—a payout of “at least $2,000 a person (not including high-income people!)”—claiming the surge in tariff revenue is big enough to share directly with Americans. The headline numbers are certainly striking. The Treasury took in $195 billion in tariff revenue in fiscal 2025, up 153% from $77 billion the year before. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projects that Trump’s broad “reciprocal tariffs” could raise $1.3 trillion through 2029 and $2.8 trillion by 2034. That would lift tariffs from about 2.7% of total federal revenue to nearly 5%, roughly comparable to imposing a new payroll tax or trimming one-fifth of the defense budget. But analysts say the math behind Trump’s proposed dividend doesn’t hold up. John Ricco of Yale’s Budget Lab estimates a $2,000 payment for every American would cost around $600 billion, far more than the government’s tariff take. “The revenue coming in would not be adequate,” Ricco told the Associated Press. Even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared caught off guard, telling ABC’s This Week that he hadn’t discussed the idea with Trump and suggesting any “rebate” would more likely appear as a future tax cut. Economists also warn that while tariffs generate revenue, they do so by driving up prices. Importers typically pass those costs to consumers, making the policy function more like a regressive tax than a dividend. Economists find that what’s emerging is a feedback loop: tariffs designed to revive industrial strength are now helping to sustain inflation, which in turn weakens real income growth and constrains the very consumers meant to benefit from the policy. UBS calls it a “narrow expansion,” but it may be narrower still: an economy whose growth depends on circular AI investments and government revenue creation schemes as opposed to the broad spending power of its citizens.",right
"WASHINGTON: When Neal Katyal walks up to the nine US Supreme Court justices on Wednesday morning, he will be arguing a case that even US President Donald Trump has said is âone of the most important in the History of the Country.â So critical that Trump himself had said he would personally be in the court before deciding not to because âI do not want to distract from the importance of the decision.â The 54-year old Indian-American attorney is the lead counsel for plaintiffs in the landmark case that will decide whether the U.S President has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), or whether, as Katyal will assert, the power of taxation and tariffs rests with Congress. âIt will be, in my opinion, one of the most important and consequential Decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court.

U.S. & China Edge Towards Ending Trade War | Global Pulse On his part, Katyal will pray before the court that it uphold the decision he won before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ,where he represented the Liberty Justice Center to secure a 7-4 ruling that said the President lacked the authority to impose sweeping tariffs. Indicative of the importance of the case, the arguments before the SC are scheduled to last for an extended period of 80 minutes, which is longer than the standard 60 minutes for cases. The courtroom is expected to be packed, with the eyes of not just Americans but the entire world glued to the proceedings. Katyal is not new to the limelight. A celebrated attorney who has argued more than 50 cases before the Supreme Court, going back to 2000 when he was co-counsel for vice-president Al Gore in the Bush v Gore case, he is a familiar figure in American legal circles, and in the eyes of many, a âTrump tormentor.â From challenging the Trump administration's travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries during its first term to arguing against the White House's efforts to expedite deportation efforts, he has been a thorn in the administrationâs side, lacing his record in courts with trenchant commentaries on MSNBC. Son of a physician mom and engineer dad who emigrated from India, the Chicago-born Katyal attended Yale Law School, where he was mentored by Akhil Amar, an Indian-American US Constitutional Law legend. While Neal's sister Sonia Katyal is a Professor of Law and co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology at UC Berkeley, Akhil Amar's brother Vikram Amar was the Dean of University of Illinois College of Law and is currently a Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of California law school.

"WASHINGTON — Vice President JD Vance mocked reporters from establishment outlets covering his discussion with Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle at Breitbart News’s latest policy event in the nation’s capital, saying, “I can see their fake news eyes.” Vance teased the 20 or so journalists from other outlets reporting live from the event after extending a greeting to the ambassadors in attendance. “Greetings to the ambassadors. We’re thrilled to have you, of course, and greetings to everybody else, including even the fake news, who I’m sure is reporting there in the back,” Vance said. “There’s a lot of fake news back there,” Boyle replied. They’re all lined up.” “I’m sure there are. I can see their fake news eyes peering up at me, I’m sure ready to misreport everything that I’ve said today,” Vance quipped, drawing laughs throughout the room. “But no, we love you guys too — kind of.” Vance then answered Boyle’s question concerning President Donald Trump’s approach to “big picture deals,” noting he just spoke with the president before joining Boyle on stage about a deal. “So here’s the thing about the President’s negotiating style, and I actually, you know, we were a little delayed, because the president called me right before I got on stage just about one of these deals that we’re working on, and what I love about it is that it’s never enough,” Vance said. “And so you bring him a deal, and you know, he sort of asks for this, this, and this. ‘We want this tariff rate. We want this country to drop their tariff barriers. We want this country to drop their non-tariff barriers.’ And you say, ‘I’m never going to be able to get that done,’ and then you get it done, and you bring it to him and he said, ‘Well, I want three other things too’ because his attitude is he wants to get the best deal possible for the American people, and for too long, we had trade negotiators that so believed in the fake idea of free trade over fair trade, that they were willing to sell American workers down the river without actually negotiating on the interests of American workers.” “So whether it’s with China or India or any of the countries that we struck deals, the basic principle is we want Americans to have better access to their markets. We believe in our workers. We think that we have the best products in the world. We want to be able to sell them everywhere. That’s number one,” he added. “Number two, we don’t want foreign products to undercut the wages of American workers. We’re actually going to protect our markets, protect our important industries, and that’s a very important part of the Trump trade plan. And you’ve seen it happen in a lot of different ways.” Vance also spoke about the benefit of economic leverage in helping to achieve peace deals. “Then the final thing, and this raises your point about Gaza or any of these other foreign deals, is we’ve been able to use the incredible economic leverage of the United States of America. I mean, we’re 25 percent, probably a little bit more than that, of the world GDP. Why don’t we ever use our economic leverage to achieve peace? Because when countries aren’t fighting each other, when they’re actually using their economic talents to manufacture good things, rather than weapons to kill each other, then that actually creates incredible economic opportunities for Americans. And that’s what the president — that’s why he’s so focused on peace. He’s fundamentally a humanitarian. And we’ve got eight peace deals at this point — we’re working on number nine and number ten.” COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"- In today’s CEO Daily: Diane Brady interviews Humana CEO Jim Rechtin. - The big story: Senate Democrats vote to end the U.S. government shutdown. - The markets: Up on hopes of the shutdown’s end. - Plus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune. Good morning. It’s been a tough year for Humana, the health-insurance giant that primarily serves seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. On Nov. 5, Humana reported a drop in net income to $1.62 a share, from $3.98 a share the year prior, and lowered its full-year earnings guidance. But CEO Jim Rechtin assumed the role last year with a mission to transform Humana’s relationship with customers. “We are not where we want to be, and we’ve been very public,” he told me. “We feel very good about the trajectory that we’re on for next year.” Here are some of his priorities, excerpted from our conversation: Culture Change: “I don’t want to pretend that there aren’t obstacles, but they are obstacles of history, the cultural biases that we bring to every conversation. We recently rolled out a new portal for the annual enrollment process. What we have never done before is say: ‘Let’s rapidly prototype one in 30 days, trial it with a bunch of real consumers, get feedback, modify the next 30 days, get feedback again and so on.’ We would have typically come up with a six-month plan to build something, with no input from the people who are going to use it and then find out that we didn’t build it quite right.” Customer Experience: “We are streamlining the prior authorization process to make it less cumbersome, both for providers and consumers … We predominantly serve seniors. They’re absolutely digitally engaged. Sometimes we get caught up in the bias that they’re not. This year we rolled out an event called the Cognitive Games, [games] like Bejeweled and Wordle. In the first week, we engaged a few hundred thousand people, so we knew we’d built something that they wanted. We’re out where consumers are, building a relationship with them. We’re not managing a payment transaction in the shadows.” Leveraging AI: “Let me give you examples. We are rolling out ambient listening technology that takes the administrative burden of being a doctor off our doctors and allows them to spend more time with the patient. We have a new tool that we just rolled out for our brokers and sales agents that we refer to as Agent Assist that allows them to streamline a very complicated sales process.” For the full Q&A, click here. Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Top news Dems vote to end shutdown Senate Democrats on Sunday broke their own party’s blockade in an effort to end the record-long government shutdown, with eight lawmakers voting with Republicans to advance a measure that would fund the government through January. The action prompted backlash from other Democrats who are outraged that their colleagues retreated from the party’s primary demand in the stalemate: extending health care insurance subsidies. Air travel concerns grow as Thanksgiving nears Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy predicted on Sunday that air travel will be “reduced to a trickle” for Thanksgiving if the government shutdown continues. Meanwhile, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told CNBC on Friday that “nobody wants to put up with [the] hassle” of booking air travel as the shutdown looms. Trump’s $2,000 tariff ‘dividend’ President Donald Trump this weekend suggested that all Americans could receive a $2,000 “dividend” funded by the revenue his tariffs are generating. Trump offered no details for this plan. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the dividend could come by way of the tax cuts included in Trump’s signature economic policy passed earlier this year.

"Listen to this article in summarized format Earlier reports indicated that Singtel was set to offload about 0.8% of its stake in the Indian telecom operator. The deal, estimated at around Rs 10,300 crore, was reportedly executed at a floor price of Rs 2,030 per share — a 3.1% discount to Airtel’s previous close. The transaction is seen as part of Singtel’s broader restructuring strategy to optimize its holdings in regional telecom ventures. Singtel has been progressively paring its stake in Bharti Airtel to unlock capital and refocus on core business areas. Earlier in May this year, the company sold a stake worth 2 billion Singapore dollars. Further, in 2022 and 2024, Singtel raised a cumulative 3.5 billion Singapore dollars from the sale of Airtel shares. This latest stake sale comes on the back of a strong second-quarter performance from Bharti Airtel. The company reported a 6% quarter-on-quarter increase in consolidated EBITDA, fueled by robust growth in both its India wireless and Airtel Africa businesses. Its Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), a key profitability metric, also exceeded expectations. Additionally, Bharti Airtel reported a healthy consolidated free cash flow of Rs 14,600 crore. The company reaffirmed that its capital expenditure for FY26 in India, excluding investments in Indus Towers, is expected to decline from FY25 levels, a move likely to support better cash generation. Looking ahead, analysts anticipate that Bharti’s premiumisation strategy and a probable tariff hike in December 2025 could contribute to significant improvements in revenue and free cash flows. Estimates project that the company may generate free cash flow of Rs 1 lakh crore between FY26 and FY27, according to research from Motilal Oswal. Motilal Oswal has maintained a “Buy” rating on Bharti Airtel, with a revised target price of Rs 2,365. The brokerage noted consistent strength in both the Indian and African markets and forecasts Bharti’s revenue and EBITDA to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% and 18%, respectively, over FY25–28. This growth is expected to be driven by tariff hikes, expansion in broadband services, and strong performance in the African segment.

"An unusual combination of Supreme Court justices appears to be coalescing to strike down President Donald Trump’s global tariffs, according to an analyst. The top court heard arguments Wednesday in a case challenging Trump’s ability to use the International Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose his so-called reciprocal tariffs and duties meant to curb the fentanyl trade. It didn’t go well for Trump. The administration’s lawyer admitted that a future president, under its own legal reasoning, could use IEEPA to declare a climate emergency and block imports of gasoline-powered cars. The solicitor general also conceded that Americans are paying part of the tariff costs and argued tariffs are not a tax meant to raise revenue—even though Trump and numerous White House officials have been touting for months how much revenue the levies are generating. A potentially decisive moment may have come when Justice Neil Gorsuch suggested the administration’s stance opens the door to a “one-way ratchet” that would allow the White House to accumulate power permanently at the expense of Congress. In a note on Thursday, Capital Alpha Partners cofounder James Lucier offered some predictions on how the justices would vote, saying conservative Amy Coney Barrett will likely join liberals Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson in going against Trump. “Crucially, the three conservative Justices who are considered to be the most conservative on the court – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch – also appear to go into the same category as Barrett,” Lucier wrote. Meanwhile, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts, who are conservatives too but have also been swing votes in the past, “seem questionably likely at best” to uphold the tariffs, he added. That suggests a potentially lopsided 7-2 vote against Trump, who appointed Gorsuch, Barrett and Kavanaugh during his first term. And even if Alito and Thomas side with the administration, the high court is still poised to hand Trump a defeat, albeit by a narrower margin. “The more likely scenarios would all have Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch voting to strike down the IEEPA tariffs or to curtail them, in our view,” Lucier said. “Alternatively, at a minimum, we could see Barrett and Gorsuch joining the three liberal Justices to strike down the tariffs 5-4.” Despite Alito and Thomas generally being more sympathetic to presidential power, they and Gorsuch would have “grave reservations” about upholding Trump’s tariffs, which raise their concerns over the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, he added. Either way, Trump’s trade war will continue For his part, Trump has made dire predictions about a Supreme Court defeat, saying the U.S. will be rendered “defenseless’’ and possibly “reduced to almost Third World status.” But even if the Supreme Court ends Trump’s global tariffs, that won’t mean all his tariffs or his trade war will go away. A different authority imposed tariffs targeting industrial sectors like autos and steel, and these cases are not before the Supreme Court. Trump could double down on that tactic to make up for the loss of his tariffs on countries. “A ruling against Trump would only be temporary setback for the administration and with several other legal tools at his disposal to apply tariffs, we can expect the trade uncertainty to continue throughout 2026,” said Christopher Hodge, head economist for the U.S. at Natixis CIB Americas, in a note on Tuesday. He pointed to provisions in the Trade Expansion Act, Trade Act, and Tariff Act that authorize duties under various circumstances. The alternate legal routes are less flexible and harder to implement, but can still maintain a very high effective tariff rate, he added. But because of the lengthier process, another round of trade talks is a possibility next year. “While we don’t envision another Liberation Day-type event, regardless of the outcome of the IEEPA case, we expect trade threats and tariff drama to continue throughout the Trump presidency,” Hodge predicted. “The extent of which will likely have significant implications on growth prospects.”",right
"ECB's Rehn Says Must Account for Risk of Slowing Inflation European Central Bank Governing Council Member Olli Rehn said the risk of inflation slowing shouldn’t be overlooked, Helsingin Sanomat reported. (Bloomberg) — European Central Bank Governing Council Member Olli Rehn said the risk of inflation slowing shouldn’t be overlooked, Helsingin Sanomat reported. Speaking in an interview published by the Finnish newspaper on Saturday, Rehn said “low energy prices, a stronger euro, and easing wage and services inflation pose a risk that total inflation slows excessively relative to our 2% target.” “This risk shouldn’t be underestimated,” Rehn said when asked whether the ECB could cut interest rates once more in December. He cautioned, however, that there are also upside inflation risks to consider. With inflation near the central bank’s 2% target, economists and investors don’t anticipate any imminent changes to the deposit rate, which has been lowered eight times this cycle, to 2% from 4%. The euro area economy has shown its resilience as the Trump administration’s tariff policies have upended global trade. Growth in the single-currency area is “slow but persistent,” the Bank of Finland governor told Helsingin Sanomat. Rehn also warned that equity markets are “clearly at risk for a correction,” underscoring the importance of bank capital buffers. “Stock prices are rather high due to the US artificial intelligence boom relative to the development in the real economy and corporate earnings,” he said. “This calls for caution.” Rehn is in the running for vice president of the ECB, endorsed by Finnish Finance Minister Riikka Purra. Croatia is prepared to support Boris Vujcic’s bid for the job, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, and Latvia has said it will also propose a candidate for the six-member Executive Board without confirming whether that will be its central-bank head, Martins Kazaks. —With assistance from Philip Tabuas.

"China announces restrictions on chemicals after deal with Trump on fentanyl tariffs WASHINGTON (AP) — China said Monday it is making good on its pledge to crack down on chemicals that can be used to make fentanyl, a key issue for President Donald Trump during recent talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as they aimed to take steps to ease a trade war. Beijing announced new export restrictions on 13 “drug-making” chemicals to the United States, Canada and Mexico, including those that are used to produce the synthetic opioid blamed for tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the U.S. every year. After meeting Xi in South Korea last month, Trump said China would help end the fentanyl crisis and he would ease a related tariff from 20% to 10%. It shows the back-and-forth nature of U.S.-Chinese cooperation on fentanyl over the years and lessens the recent tensions after Trump launched his campaign of tariffs, including those against the country that is the top exporter of pharmaceutical ingredients, such as the chemicals used to make fentanyl. “What the Trump administration has essentially agreed with Beijing is for Beijing to restart what it had been doing during the second part of 2024,” before Trump returned to the White House, said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow focusing on the opioid crisis at the Brookings Institution. Asked for the White House’s response to the Chinese export restrictions and whether the deal essentially resumes the cooperation from China that was disrupted by Trump’s tariffs, deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said the president “has taken every possible action to stop the flow of illicit narcotics into our country, from securing the border to striking drug boats to curbing fentanyl precursors.” Cooperation on fentanyl has long been a sticking point in relations between Beijing and Washington. In 2019, during Trump’s first term, Beijing took a huge step by restricting fentanyl and related substances at the request of the U.S. president. When tensions rose between Beijing and Washington over human rights issues, China started to stall counternarcotics cooperation in 2020 before making it formal two years later. The U.S. in 2023 listed China as a “major illicit drug-producing country” before then-President Joe Biden met Xi in California to secure Beijing’s agreement to cooperate. Shortly afterward, Beijing restricted more substances, including another synthetic opioid and chemicals that are added to fentanyl. Other key fentanyl precursors were curtailed in September 2024. After Trump took office, he slapped two 10% tariffs on China, accusing it of failing to stem the flow of chemicals. Beijing responded with its own tariffs and pausing cooperation on fentanyl. “The Trump administration made the big error in completely discounting and ignoring what China was doing with the U.S. in 2024 and just coming in with guns blazing” on tariffs, Felbab-Brown said. That, she said, has allowed Beijing to bargain to resume measures that were already on the table in the second half of 2024 and “get double points.” Also on Monday, Beijing took another step aimed at addressing U.S. concerns, signaling tougher enforcement with a public notice by the China National Narcotics Control Commission urging businesses to comply with tax codes, customs rules, internet laws and foreign currency regulations. The chemicals newly restricted by Beijing can still be exported without a license to other countries besides the three in North America that were named in the Chinese Commerce Ministry announcement. Fentanyl is mostly manufactured in Mexico. The challenge remains that the “very basic chemicals” with widespread, legitimate uses in chemistry, agriculture and the pharmaceutical industry are increasingly tapped to make synthetic opioids, Felbab-Brown said. In September, Trump continued to list China as a “major illicit drug-producing country.” “For too long, (China) has enabled illicit fentanyl production in Mexico and elsewhere by subsidizing the export of the precursor chemicals needed to produce these deadly drugs and failing to prevent Chinese companies from selling these precursors to known criminal cartels,” the presidential statement said.

"NEW DELHI: India is hopeful of reaching a framework trade deal with the US this year that should address the tariff issue to the benefit of Indian exporters, commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal said here Friday. While a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) will take time, a framework trade deal will address the reciprocal tariff challenge faced by Indian exporters. ""These are two separate parallel negotiations going on (framework trade deal and a comprehensive BTA), but one will feed into the other. What needs to come first is the framework trade deal, which will be able to address reciprocal tariffs,"" Agrawal said at Ficci event. While the two countries have been negotiating for a long time now, Us tariffs on Indian exports have created hurdles. Not giving a specific timeframe for the framework deal, Agrawal said: ""All I can say is that we are close, we have tried to iron out most of the issues. Now, it is only a matter of time the decision has to be taken when the two countries have to find the right landing zone to announce the deal."" Addressing the event, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said India is currently negotiating FTAs with about 50 individual countries and groups of nations. ""We have all seen trade being weaponised. We have all seen the importance of having trusted partners around the world,"" he said. The Gulf Cooperation Council - Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain -is also interested in trade pact talks. India has already implemented a comprehensive trade agreement with the UAE and talks with Oman are on the verge of completion. Bahrain and Qatar want to enter into negotiations with India. ""The whole six-nation group would like to engage. We are talking to New Zealand...We are in active discussions with the US and with 27-nation EU,"" Goyal said. India is reviewing its trade pacts with 10-nation Asean bloc (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) and with Korea to bring more balance to it. ""We are working with Eurasia (EAEU), which has started negotiations yesterday or the day before yesterday. We are equally engaged to start negotiations very quickly with Israel. Canada and India are looking at CEPA (comprehensive economic partnership agreement). Next week, they are going to start a conversation around that,"" he added.",right
"Samsung and other South Korean firms pledge larger domestic investments after US tariff deal SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics and other major South Korean companies on Sunday announced fresh domestic investment plans at a meeting with President Lee Jae Myung, who hopes the moves will counter concerns that the firms would prioritize U.S. investments under a trade deal. Lee’s meeting with business leaders came days after his government finalized a trade deal with the United States, in which Seoul pledged to invest $350 billion in U.S. industries in exchange for averting the Trump administration’s highest tariffs. Samsung, a global leader in computer chips, said it will invest 450 trillion won ($310 billion) over the next five years to expand its domestic operations, including building another production line at its Pyeongtaek manufacturing hub to meet surging global semiconductor demands fueled by artificial intelligence. Samsung said the new line, set to begin operations in 2028, is part of its broader effort to secure additional production capacity in anticipation of rising mid- to long-term demands for memory chips. The company also plans to build AI data centers in the country’s southwest South Jeolla Province and the southeastern city of Gumi to support government efforts to reduce the development gap between the greater Seoul metropolitan area and other regions. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea’s largest automaker, said it plans to invest 125 trillion won ($86.3 billion) from 2026 to 2030 to expand domestic research and development and advance new technologies such as AI, robotics and self-driving cars. SK Group, another semiconductor powerhouse, and shipbuilders Hanwha Ocean and HD Hyundai also announced plans to increase their domestic investments. Both are central to South Korean commitments to boost the U.S. shipbuilding industry, a sector highlighted by President Donald Trump in negotiations with Seoul. In his meeting with the companies’ chiefs, Lee credited the business sector for helping his government negotiate the trade deal with Washington but urged the companies to maintain strong domestic investments to ease concerns they might cut spending at home to invest more in America. He said his government is exploring various policy steps, including easing regulations, to help create a more favorable business environment for the companies. SK Chair Chey Tae-won, whose group plans to invest at least 128 trillion won ($88.3 billion) domestically through 2028 with a focus on AI, said the finalization of trade talks with the United States eases uncertainties and paves way for bolder domestic investment. The two governments on Friday released the details of the trade agreement, including $150 billion in South Korean investments in the U.S. shipbuilding sector and an additional $200 billion in other American industries, which Seoul says will be capped at $20 billion per year to prevent financial instability. The United States agreed to reduce tariffs on South Korean cars and auto parts from 25% to 15%, and to apply tariffs on South Korean semiconductors on terms “no less favorable” than those granted to comparable competitors in the future.

"President Donald Trump has warned that the United States will be rendered “defenseless’’ and possibly “reduced to almost Third World status” if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs he imposed this year on nearly every country on earth. The justices sounded skeptical during oral arguments Wednesday of his sweeping claims of authority to impose tariffs as he sees fit. The truth, though, is that Trump will still have plenty of options to keep taxing imports aggressively even if the court rules against him. He can re-use tariff powers he deployed in his first term and can reach for others, including one that dates back to the Great Depression. “It’s hard to see any pathway here where tariffs end,” said Georgetown trade law professor Kathleen Claussen. “I am pretty convinced he could rebuild the tariff landscape he has now using other authorities.” At Wednesday’s hearing, in fact, lawyer Neal Katyal, representing small businesses suing to get the tariffs struck down, argued that Trump didn’t need the boundless authority he’s claimed to impose tariffs under 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). That is because Congress delegated tariff power to the White House in several other statutes — though it carefully limited the ways the president could use the authority. “Congress knows exactly how to delegate its tariff powers,” Katyal said. Tariffs have become a cornerstone of Trump’s foreign policy in his second term, with double-digit “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on most countries, which he has justified by declaring America’s longstanding trade deficits a national emergency. The average U.S. tariff has gone from 2.5% when Trump returned to the White House in January to 17.9%, the highest since 1934, according to calculations by Yale University’s Budget Lab. The president acted alone even though the U.S. Constitution specifically gives the power to tax – and impose tariffs – to Congress. Still, Trump “will have other tools that can cause pain,’’ said Stratos Pahis of Brooklyn Law School. Here’s a look at some of his options: Countering unfair trade practices The United States has long had a handy cudgel to wallop countries it accuses of engaging in “unjustifiable,” “unreasonable” or “discriminatory” trade practices. That is Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. And Trump has made aggressive use of it himself — especially against China. In his first term, he cited Section 301 to impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports in a dispute over the sharp-elbowed tactics that Beijing was using to challenge America’s technological dominance. The U.S. is also using 301 powers to counter what it calls unfair Chinese practices in the shipbuilding industry. “You’ve had Section 301 tariffs in place against China for years,” said Ryan Majerus, a partner at King & Spalding and a trade official in Trump’s first administration and in Biden’s. There are no limits on the size of Section 301 tariffs. They expire after four years but can be extended. But the administration’s trade representative must conduct an investigation and typically hold a public hearing before imposing 301 tariffs. John Veroneau, general counsel for the U.S. trade representative in the George W. Bush administration, said Section 301 is useful in taking on China. But it has drawbacks when it comes to dealing with the smaller countries that Trump has hammered with reciprocal tariffs. “Undertaking dozens and dozens of 301 investigations of all of those countries is a laborious process,” Veroneau said. Targeting trade deficits In striking down Trump’s reciprocal tariffs in May, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that the president couldn’t use emergency powers to combat trade deficits. That is partly because Congress had specifically given the White House limited authority to address the problem in another statute: Section 122, also of the Trade Act of 1974. That allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days in response to unbalanced trade. The administration doesn’t even have to conduct an investigation beforehand. But Section 122 authority has never been used to apply tariffs, and there is some uncertainty about how it would work. Protecting national security In both of his terms, Trump has made aggressive use of his power — under Section 232 of Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — to impose tariffs on imports that he deems a threat to national security. In 2018, he slapped tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, levies he’s expanded since returning to the White House. He also plastered Section 232 tariffs on autos, auto parts, copper, lumber. In September, the president even levied Section 232 tariffs on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture. “Even though people might roll their eyes” at the notion that imported furniture poses a threat to national security, Veroneau said, “it’s difficult to get courts to second-guess a determination by a president on a national security matter.” Section 232 tariffs are not limited by law but do require an investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department. It’s the administration itself that does the investigating – also true for Section 301 cases — “so they have a lot of control over the outcome,” Veroneau said. Reviving Depression-era tariffs Nearly a century ago, with the U.S. and world economies in collapse, Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1930, imposing hefty taxes on imports. Known as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs (for their congressional sponsors), these levies have been widely condemned by economists and historians for limiting world commerce and making the Great Depression worse. They also got a memorable pop culture shoutout in the 1986 movie “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.” Section 338 of the law authorizes the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that have discriminated against U.S. businesses. No investigation is required, and there’s no limit on how long the tariffs can stay in place. Those tariffs have never been imposed — U.S. trade negotiators traditionally have favored Section 301 sanctions instead — though the United States used the threat of them as a bargaining chip in trade talks in the 1930s. In September, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters that the administration was considering Section 338 as a Plan B if the Supreme Court ruled against Trump’s use of emergency powers tariffs. The Smoot-Hawley legislation has a bad reputation, Veroneau said, but Trump might find it appealing. “To be the first president to ever use it could have some cache.”",right

"As US Rally Pauses, Global Stocks Enjoy Historic Outperformance A year ago, investors were sure that a presidential win for Donald Trump would doom international stocks to underperform the US market due to his promises to ratchet up tariffs and cut taxes. A year later, they can’t get enough of global equities. (Bloomberg) — A year ago, investors were sure that a presidential win for Donald Trump would doom international stocks to underperform the US market due to his promises to ratchet up tariffs and cut taxes. A year later, they can’t get enough of global equities. The first year of Trump’s second presidency has brought an unusual reversal to a long-running trend: Benchmarks in China, Europe and Canada have all outperformed the S&P 500 in dollar terms since his election victory a year ago. MSCI Inc.’s gauge of global equities excluding the US is beating Wall Street this year by the widest margin since 2009, and the selloff triggered yesterday by valuation concerns doesn’t change the picture. Investors have poured money into global equities since Trump’s election. Initially, it was to hedge against US stock volatility triggered by the president’s chaotic rollout of tariffs. Then they went looking for cheaper alternatives to the S&P 500, an index that’s been driven by richly valued tech stocks. A weakening US currency has flattered international returns in dollar terms. “There was a clear consensus among strategists that the impact would be brutal on global stocks, but actually, it wasn’t,” said Florian Allain, a fund manager at Mandarine Gestion in Paris. “The big surprise this year has been how the falling dollar and the tariffs headwinds are currently and gradually being digested.” The performance is vindication for a few strategists, notably Peter Oppenheimer at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett, who presciently said in 2024 that investors should look beyond the US market. Hartnett, for one, now expects the pace of outperformance to slow amid strong US earnings growth and lower bond yields, but remains positive on international equities. Investors are likely to further shift money into global stocks in the second half of the decade after the first half was all about US exceptionalism, he said. Asia’s Outperformance Asian equities have outperformed thanks to the region’s position at the heart of the AI supply chain — home to major chipmakers, foundries, and semiconductor-equipment bellwethers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co., and Tokyo Electron Ltd. South Korea’s Kospi Index has surged 55% in the past year, the best performance among major countries, reflecting its status as Asia’s most attractively valued AI proxy. With valuations now stretched, the next phase of the rally will depend on companies showing that all their spending on artificial intelligence is paying off with earnings, capital spending trends extending into 2026, and whether Trump sustains a cooperative approach toward China on trade. In the meantime, stocks are vulnerable to pullbacks, according to Xin-Yao Ng, a fund manager at Aberdeen Investments. “I will not be surprised if we see a year-end correction as the market has been quite momentum-driven, and there will be funds that will want to lock up returns ahead of year end, especially after such a strong run,” said Ng. “I still think there are legs but I’m not sure how long it can last; risk is definitely rising.” Still global markets remain cheaper than US shares. If AI optimism endures, Korea, Taiwan, and parts of China could remain at the forefront of global equity leadership. Meanwhile, in Europe, things are looking much better than anticipated. Economic indicators are on the rise, inflation is contained and the European Central Bank has already lowered interest rates to 2%, a much lower level than in the US. Separately, the European Union, and Germany in particular, are ramping up defense and infrastructure spending for the next decade, with the effects set to kick in this by the end of this year. That has boosted financial, defense and energy-transition stocks. Outside the accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, European businesses have blunted the impact of tariffs by measures including price hikes and cost cutting, as well as direct trade negotiations with the Trump administration at the industry or company levels. The US has slapped a 15% tariff on goods imported from the European Union, 10% from the UK and 39% from Switzerland, in addition to sectoral levies on industries like steel. In many cases, the tariffs have turned out to be less damaging than the initial announcements would indicate. “Europe isn’t in a bad position for 2026,” said Mandarine Gestion’s Allain. “Looking forward, I expect a tailwind from European growth accelerating with the German stimulus plan and therefore the growth gap with the US to somewhat close a bit.” Despite being hit by the highest tariffs in Europe, Switzerland’s exports to the US rebounded in September, suggesting demand is withstanding the impact. Separately, pharmaceutical companies Novartis AG and Roche Holding AG have been in talks with the US on cutting drug prices and have pledged billions in investments for a reprieve on looming sectoral tariffs. UK peer AstraZeneca Plc struck a deal in October. Still, the Swiss market has underperformed this year, up just 6.2% compared with 15% for the euro-area peer Euro Stoxx 50, as investors mostly shunned exporters and defensive stocks. Earnings Grow Globally In Canada, a country that Trump said he would use “economic force” to annex and make the 51st state, investors felt a sense of dread after the election, said Philip Petursson at IGM Wealth Management. Petursson said his firm was defensive going into 2025 and underweight equities given the high level of economic uncertainty and expectations for punitive tariffs. Instead, the market has seen strong gains since Trump backed off his harshest tariff threats in early April. The S&P/TSX Composite Index has risen 23% since the election and is on pace to outperform its US counterpart in a rising market for the first time since 2010. Petursson went overweight on stocks in Canada as well as other international and emerging markets in April. “The earnings growth is going to be just as strong here as they are in the US but at a better price,” he said. “I can pick up the same earnings profile at two-thirds the cost of the S&P 500 on a P/E basis.” Over in emerging markets, equities are close to topping their 2021 high after a rally of about 30% this year, largely led by Asian shares. One standout market can be found in Brazil, another country targeted by a high US tariff rate. Brazilian stocks have jumped 44% in dollar terms, with the nation’s benchmark Ibovespa index repeatedly hitting record highs. Expectations of lower interest rates, both globally and at home, have fueled the Ibovespa’s rally, with foreign investors pouring more than $4 billion into the local equity market. “What’s really reassuring is the speed at which companies have adapted to tariffs and have been able to announce shift of production to other countries or the US,” said Ariane Hayate, a fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management. —With assistance from Leda Alvim.

"President Donald Trump promised on Monday that his administration will begin issuing $2,000 “tariff dividend” checks to Americans around the middle of 2026, the most specific timetable he has offered yet on a proposal that can’t seem to find a home within a campaign-esque promise, economic argument and political provocation. “We’re going to be issuing dividends later on, somewhere prior to … probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, according to Axios. The payments, he said, would go to “individuals of moderate income, middle income.” The commitment marks an escalation from Trump’s earlier, vaguer assertions that tariffs are generating enough money to fund direct payments to American households. But turning the idea into actual checks is far more complicated than his easy-going rhetoric suggests. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made that clear over the weekend, saying on Fox News that the administration “needs legislation” to distribute any such dividend. “We will see,” he added. Bessent also implied that the structure could take forms other than a check — for instance, a tax rebate — signaling uncertainty inside the administration about what Trump’s proposal even is. The math is another obstacle. A $2,000-per-person dividend, even if limited to Americans with low or middle incomes, would cost well over the $200 billion that Trump’s tariffs have brought in. If the checks resembled the COVID-era stimulus structure — which went to adults and children alike— the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the price tag could reach $600 billion. That would mean that Trump’s tariffs would be a net $400 billion negative for the U.S. in 2026, based on current projections. And the future of that revenue is itself uncertain. The Supreme Court is expected to rule within months on whether Trump exceeded his authority when he imposed sweeping tariffs by invoking national emergency powers. So far, both conservative and liberal supreme court justices have seemed skeptical of his arguments. If the Court rules against him, the administration may have to somehow refund billions in collected duties to importers, which would be the opposite of Trump’s promised “dividend.” Trump argues the stakes are existential, claiming a loss could cost the U.S. $3 trillion in refunds and lost investment. The White House did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Still, Trump continues to present tariffs as an all-purpose economic engine: a way to protect U.S. factories, pressure foreign governments, strengthen the federal budget, and now, finance what he has described as a populist windfall. Trump and the Republican party broadly have been focused on winning voters’ favor back on “affordability” ever since Democrats’ swept elections earlier this month. The President even said on Friday that he would roll back tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and commodities, even as he continues to insist that tariffs don’t raise prices. “Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems. It is a complete CON JOB,” he wrote Friday on Truth Social.",right
"For nearly two decades, esteemed economist Nouriel Roubini has worn the nickname “Dr. Doom” with honor. He earned it in the mid-2000s for warning of a housing crash that Wall Street dismissed, until he was proven catastrophically right. Since then, the NYU Stern School of Business professor emeritus has become one of the most recognizable bears in global finance, regularly sounding alarms about debt spirals, geopolitical shocks, pandemics, AI disruptions, and what he once called “the mother of all crises.” So it’s perhaps surprising, even disorienting, that in the midst of investors teetering on the edge of a bear market, Roubini is breaking with his cohort—including fellow 2008-financial-crisis-prophet Michael Burry—to dismiss their pessimism about the U.S. economy as misplaced. In a new essay for the Financial Times, the economist argues that the conventional view—that America’s “Liberation Day” tariffs would trigger stagflation, tank the stock market, kneecap the dollar, and end U.S. exceptionalism—is simply wrong. Instead, he sees something close to the opposite: a short period of cooling growth, followed by a powerful rebound led by technology and capital spending that keeps the U.S. firmly in the top spot. “The now common view that the U.S. stock market is in a massive bubble and bound to crash is incorrect over the medium term,” he wrote. On the other hand, what he predicted isn’t necessarily the rosiest. The near-term picture looks like a “growth recession,’ he said, meaning slower, below-potential GDP. It’s not the hard landing or 1970s-style stagflation many have predicted, and it isn’t a bubble popping, but it’s a lopsided economy, as many Wall Street analysts have also noticed. Tariffs won’t topple the recovery Roubini, who once warned of a “mega-threatened age”—the era where AI, aging populations, and global instability threatened our prosperity—now argues the most extreme fears about tariffs and policy missteps haven’t materialized. That’s partly because, he says, this administration is responsive to market reactions. When asset prices slumped immediately after the tariff announcement, the administration “blinked,” softening policy and opening the door to more conventional trade negotiations. By next year, he says, growth will reaccelerate. The Fed is undergoing a period of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus is still flowing, and—critically—AI-related capital expenditure continues to surge. Roubini’s arguments align closely with two of Wall Street’s top analysts: Torsten Slok of Apollo Global Management and Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley. Slok, known for his “Daily Spark,” combining insightful charts with brevity, argued on Nov. 20 that the economy is “likely to reaccelerate in 2026.” Just days earlier, he had warned of inequality, saying: “It is a K-shaped economy for U.S. consumers.” He has also flagged extreme concentration and valuations in the stock market, with the Magnificent Seven running far ahead of the rest of the market. Wilson, chief equity strategist for Morgan Stanley, has been predicting a “rolling recession” for years, arguing that different sectors of the economy shrank at different times, resulting in something that felt like a recession, but unevenly distributed. This changed in April 2022, when a “rolling recovery” set in, he has argued since then, forecasting an economic boom ahead. Wilson has argued for the possibility of a correction in stocks but, like Roubini, does not see a crash as imminent. Tech > tariffs The core of Roubini’s argument rests on a simple hierarchy: Tariffs and policy noise are temporary, but technological leadership that results in innovation compounding over decades is not. “Tech trumps tariffs,” he writes. He estimates U.S. potential growth could double from 2% to 4% by the end of the decade, powered by innovation in AI and machine learning, robotics, quantum computing, commercial space, and defense technology. While this agrees with many Wall Street predictions (Goldman Sachs sees real potential growth reaching 2.3% in the early 2030s, for instance), the prediction of 4% blows most others out of the water. However, those industries, Roubini argues, will continue to deliver the “exceptionalism” that has set the U.S. apart for the past 20 years—to the extent that productivity will boost the economy by double digits. If potential growth rises, he says, equity returns should, too. When growth averaged only 2% over the past two decades, annual returns still hovered in the double digits. Faster growth means even faster earnings expansion, and valuations that look elevated today may be supported rather than speculative. Roubini has been striking a more positive tone for about a year now—in August 2024, while everyone feared a downturn was coming and grew frustrated that the Fed wouldn’t ease, he calmed market fears again. Debt—and the dollar—look less dangerous than feared One of the most persistent fears around AI-driven spending is debt sustainability. But Roubini argues that this math would change if growth rises even modestly. The Congressional Budget Office projects debt-to-GDP soaring under 1.6% real growth assumptions. But if growth averages 2.3% or higher, the ratio stabilizes. At 3% or more, it falls, meaning that we could potentially grow ourselves out of debt; an argument President Donald Trump has also used. A tech-driven “supply shock” could also push inflation lower over time as production costs drop while productivity booms, meaning higher real rates may not translate into higher nominal yields. Even external liabilities look manageable, he argues, because rising tech investment tends to attract foreign equity inflows, similar to how “emerging-market” economies finance growth during a resource boom. Roubini also dismisses the widely discussed decline of the dollar, since he believes that the U.S. will accelerate while Europe stagnates, and thus the dollar will ultimately strengthen. Notably, “Dr. Doom” admitted that the U.S.’s top adversary, China, is at least on par with the U.S. in innovating in the “most important industries of the future,” such as AI and robotics. However, he doesn’t seem too concerned with the AI arms race. “The U.S. economy and markets are best positioned among advanced economies,” Roubini wrote. “They will continue to benefit from the U.S. being the most innovative advanced country.”",right
"Euro Zone Set for Moderate Growth After 2025 Resilience, EU Says The euro-area economy will maintain its moderate expansion after weathering Donald Trump’s tariff turmoil better than expected, according to the European Commission. (Bloomberg) — The euro-area economy will maintain its moderate expansion after weathering Donald Trump’s tariff turmoil better than expected, according to the European Commission. Output will rise 1.3% in 2025, 1.2% in 2026 and 1.4% in 2027, the European Union’s executive arm said Monday in its autumn outlook. That’s an upgrade for this year compared with May’s prediction, and a small downgrade for 2026. Inflation is seen at 2.1% in 2025, as previously forecast, and should stick close to the ECB’s 2% target over the next two years. Officials cautioned, however, that the 2027 figure, which matches that goal, includes an upward effect from a new carbon-pricing system that governments and lawmakers want to postpone. “Even in an adverse environment, the EU’s economy has continued to grow,” Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said. “Now, given the challenging external context, the EU must take resolute action to unlock domestic growth.” The predictions are more upbeat than the latest from the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, with policymakers in the region sounding increasingly optimistic on the months ahead having seemingly avoided the worst-case scenario on trade and with inflation now under control near 2%. The commission said recent outperformance was driven by a pre-tariff surge in exports at the start of the year, though investments also contributed. Despite the volatile global backdrop, higher spending by governments, private consumption and a tight labor market should underpin expansion, it said. Output in the 20-nation currency bloc — which will welcome Bulgaria from Jan. 1 — rose 0.2% in the third quarter, though the headline number masked variations across the region. While Spain and France grew by 0.6% and 0.5%, Germany and Italy stagnated. The commission sees that divergence narrowing, with Spanish growth slowing to 2.3% next year from 2.9% in 2025 while the three biggest economies all gather momentum. Germany has struggled to shake off two years of contraction during a volatile 2025. While boosted by the early-year rush in exports, a reversal later on weighed. Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s plan to spend hundreds of billions of euros on infrastructure and defence should help boost growth to 1.2% in both 2026 and 2027 — up from 0.2% this year. France, meanwhile, has been held back by political turbulence over its budget. The resulting uncertainty is set to weigh on gross domestic product next year, though it’s still expected to rise 0.9% compared with 0.7% in 2025, the commission said. ECB officials have also touted the economy’s resilience to issues including US tariffs and the war in Ukraine. Most don’t see a need to cut interest rates beyond their current level of 2%, barring another shock. The commission appeared to largely agree with that stance, calling risks to inflation “broadly balanced” while cautioning that the growth outlook “remains subject to high uncertainty, with downside risks prevailing.” The ECB’s next batch of forecasts — due when officials next meet to set borrowing costs on Dec. 18 — will be closely watched for signs of a more pronounced inflation undershoot. That could reignite discussions about further reductions in interest rates, following the eight enacted so far this cycle. The planned delay of the ETS2 carbon-pricing system, which the commission said would lift consumers’ energy costs by 3% in 2027 if it isn’t pushed back, has increased those risks. Turning to the fiscal outlook, the commission sees the euro zone’s collective budget deficit widening to 3.4% in 2027 from 3.1% in 2024, partly due to a ramp-up in defense spending. That would raise the debt burden to just above 90% of GDP in two years’ time. —With assistance from Jorge Valero. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Carney to announce more support for steel and other sectors as trade war grinds on Ottawa to further tighten foreign steel trade and lower the costs of shipping the metal within Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney plans to announce two new measures to help Canada’s struggling steel sector, which continues to face 50 per cent tariffs on its exports to the United States. The federal government plans to lower the volume of steel that countries lacking a free trade agreement with Canada can import on a duty-free basis and also introduce policies to reduce the cost of steel shipments via rail within Canada. The announcements will be made Wednesday afternoon, according to a source who was not authorized to speak publicly and was first reported by the Toronto Star. Domestic steel producers are struggling to find new customers for their products as the U.S. market increasingly closes off to them. Carney also plans to announce policies to aid other sectors struggling in the trade war, including softwood lumber producers. This summer, the federal government announced a $400-million loan to Algoma Steel Inc. and Ontario provided it $100 million. The company said it derived more than half its revenue last year from U.S. sales, but it expects those sales to drop to zero by the year-end if U.S. tariffs remain in place. Earlier this year, the Canadian Steel Producers Association lobbied the federal government to impose even more stringent limits on steel imports to Canada. It asked the government to limit steel imports to 25 per cent of the volumes sent in 2024 and apply it to all countries, whether they have a free-trade agreement with Canada or not. In June, Carney said countries lacking a free-trade agreement with Canada would be limited to exporting the same amount of steel they shipped here in 2024. In July, he lowered the rate to 50 per cent of 2024 volumes and applied a 50 per cent tariff to any steel in excess of that volume. Today, he plans to lower the limit once again to 20 per cent, but it only affects countries that lack a free-trade agreement, according to the source. British Columbia and other Western provinces have also said that shipping steel from Central and Eastern Canada — particularly Ontario and Quebec, where much of the industry is based — is prohibitively expensive because of rail costs. Trade groups and B.C. ministers have repeatedly asked the federal government to consider that when imposing restrictions on steel imports. • Email: gfriedman@postmedia.com Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"President Donald Trump on Sunday made it clear how he feels about people who do not agree with tariffs. Writing in a post on his Truth Social platform, the president said, “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” “We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k’s are Highest EVER. We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion,” he added. “Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place. A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” Trump concluded. His statement comes as the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments recently about the legality of his use of emergency powers to impose tariffs on imports from nearly every trading partner, Breitbart News reported Wednesday: At issue is whether Mr. Trump properly invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, a law that gives presidents broad authority during national emergencies, to levy tariffs he says are necessary to address trade deficits, pressure other countries to help the U.S. combat fentanyl smuggling, and protect American manufacturing. The case has enormous implications for American businesses and consumers, as well as for Mr. Trump’s economic agenda. The president has made tariffs a centerpiece of his trade policy, using them to pressure foreign governments and bring manufacturing back to the United States. In September, Peter Navarro, who is the senior counselor to Trump for trade and manufacturing, said during a Founders Roundtable on Breitbart Fight Club that the president has proven the nation can use tariffs to lower its trade deficit. He added, “What the president has swiftly done is make it very clear to the world, they’re not going to cheat us anymore.” A recent Economist/YouGov poll found Trump’s use of tariffs has overwhelming support among Republican voters, per Breitbart News.

"Listen to this article in summarized format PSU Banks: A Constructive Outlook “No, we like the entire pack. We have invested in PNB, Canara, SBI is the largest weight in the portfolio, 8%. And we have seen a fantastic rally. We have booked profits in smaller names, but we still remain very-very constructive on SBI,” said Thakkar. He added that while PNB Housing may benefit from lower borrowing costs post-upgrade, PSU banks already have low cost of funds. “So, I do not see any significant benefit, but I think that the PSU bank as a pack will continue to do well,” he noted. Trade Deals and Tariff Reduction: Opportunities in Textiles and Beyond Thakkar highlighted potential upside in sectors like textiles and pharma if the India-US trade deal materializes. “We have, for example, bought Indo Count and Welspun, both small weights in our portfolio. This tariff reduction theme is interesting,” he said, adding a note of caution for investors. He also highlighted ELGi Equipment, a 65-year-old, debt-free company with 20% ROCE. “Once the tariff covering comes down below 20%, which is wishful thinking but can happen, then this company can do extremely well because 25% of their business is in the US,” Thakkar explained. He emphasized the company’s strong aftermarket business, which contributes 28% of revenues, adding to stickiness and high margins. Margins on the Rise at ELGi On the rising margins of ELGi, Thakkar said, “Aftermarket is very important for them because aftermarket comes with higher margin and stickiness. They continuously innovate and reduce costs. Even with 50% tariff, they grew their North America business.” Infosys Buyback: A Long-Term Positive Turning to IT stocks, Thakkar weighed in on the upcoming Infosys buyback at Rs 1,800, noting that the stock currently trades around Rs 1,485. “We are underweight in IT as of now but have Infosys as a large weight along with Tech Mahindra. Buybacks reduce the share count and increase intrinsic value over time,” he said. He acknowledged the tax implications for investors but praised the company for returning capital: “This kind of muted scenario for discretionary spending won’t last forever. Infosys is giving 18,000 crore back to shareholders, which is a great step. People often fund loss-making companies instead—this is an anomaly that may last six to nine months.” Bottom Line Parag Thakkar remains constructive on PSU banks, bullish on tariff reduction plays in select small caps, and supportive of Infosys’ buyback strategy, suggesting investors take a longer-term view amid temporary market challenges.

"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent explained on Meet the Press “The Europeans tell me, ‘Oh, we’re doing our 19th sanctions package.’ In my line Kristen, if you’re going to do something 19 times, you failed,” Bessent said on the Sunday show. “Instead, President Trump will move forward with a bold initiative that the Europeans would not follow us on. He put a 25 percent tariff on India because they were buying Russian oil. On Monday, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced it would remove eight persons from its sanctions list. Bessent said, “They were funding the war on themselves,” noting that Europeans were buying oil from Indian refineries that they refused to tariff. Undersecretary of the Treasury John Hurley on Monday said that the Treasury Department is no longer issuing sanctions for the purpose of “political posturing.” “The Biden administration issued a large number of sanctions often without a clear strategic purpose. Under President Trump and Secretary Bessent’s leadership, no longer are we issuing sanctions for the purpose of political posturing. Treasury is focused on sanctions that are financially and economically effective and that advance defined national security objectives,” Hurley told Breitbart News in a written statement. “We will also continue to remove sanctions when applicable and consistent with the law after a thorough review. The goal is simple: To ensure our sanctions are impactful, lawful, and aligned with President Trump’s agenda,” he added. OFAC removed eight persons from the sanctions list, which includes five individuals and three entities. Three individuals on the list had resigned from their prior roles and severed their relationships with Russian financier Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov. The Biden administration, along with the United Kingdom, sanctioned Usmanov, one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires, and his network. A Treasury spokesperson said that these removals are not indicative of any shifts in American policy towards Russia, and the removals are part of a monthslong review process. The spokesperson said that OFAC not only has the ability to sanction individuals but must remain willing to remove them from the list consistent with federal law.

"Back in April, President Donald Trump touted his aggressive tariff policy as a catalyst for the reshoring of manufacturing jobs. Eight months later, reshoring progress is nowhere to be seen. The jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released last week found that while nonfarm payrolls increased by 119,000, there were 6,000 fewer manufacturing jobs, adding to the tally of 59,000 lost factory jobs since Trump’s April vows to ignite domestic manufacturing. The Labor Bureau’s data is consistent with the Institute for Supply Management November report, which indicated an eighth consecutive month of contracting manufacturing jobs. “The US is losing blue-collar jobs for the first time since the pandemic…as manufacturing industries lose jobs at a rapid pace while growth in construction & transportation has nearly zeroed out,” economic commentator Joseph Politano noted in a LinkedIn post last week. In a frozen white-collar job market, blue-collar trade and factory jobs have been seen as a safe haven for not just Gen Z, but antsy office workers more broadly. But fewer manufacturing jobs mean job prospects in this low-fire, low-hire market may be bleaker than even some workers anticipated. The shrinking manufacturing opportunities, meant to be a balm for domestic labor woes, are ironically a result of Trump’s whipsaw tariff policy intended to restore factory jobs, according to Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab. “It is striking how soft manufacturing has been because in theory, you put tariffs in place to protect domestic manufacturing, so that domestic manufacturing employment grows,” Ullrich told Fortune. “And we have seen the opposite of that.” Tariff troubles Ullrich attributes the contracting manufacturing sector in part to the uncertainty tariffs have brought, which has disincentivized companies from growing their workforce. In a September note to clients, Pantheon Macroeconomics analysts Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen attributed shrinking wage growth in the U.S. to tariff-struck companies trying to maintain margins by trimming labor costs. Similarly, Ullrich argued, companies trying to navigate new variables are usually less concerned with growth. “Oftentimes when there is heightened uncertainty, it’s just difficult for businesses and people to make decisions in real time,” she said. “And so that slows down employment. It slows down all those processes.” To be sure, nearly all jobs—with the exception of the health care and leisure hospitality sectors, which continue to grow and include many blue-collar roles—have stagnated as a result of economic uncertainty, Ullrich noted, but manufacturing jobs may have another vulnerability due to tariffs. Trump’s tariffs have had an impact on intermediate goods, or products used in the process of creating a final, finished good. These levies have hiked up input and production costs, which can discourage hiring. A study published this month in the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy found that during former President George Bush’s second term in 2002, his steel tariffs did not improve local steel manufacturing unemployment, but rather depressed it, even years after the tariffs were removed. “When you tax the intermediate goods, that’s going to manufacturers directly,” Ullrich said. “That’s part of what we’re seeing.” Labor mismatch The latest jobs report doesn’t tell the full story on manufacturing, however. Ullrich cited Indeed data that found job postings for manufacturing jobs have remained resilient, despite a contracting industry. She said while there are fewer job opportunities, the sector is still seeing a shortage of individuals qualified for manufacturing work. “Some of the declines in blue-collar employment could be about labor demand going down,” Ullrich said. “But it also could be about labor supply shortages and a mismatch between the jobs that are available and the skills that people have to fill those jobs.” Earlier this month, Ford CEO Jim Farley lamented in an episode of the Office Hours: Business Edition podcast that Ford had 5,000 open mechanic roles, some with a salary of $120,000, that the company was unable to fill. A 2024 survey from the Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte of more than 200 manufacturing companies, more than 65% of firms said recruiting and retaining workers was their biggest challenge. It could be, then, that despite fewer manufacturing opportunities out there today, pursuing trade skills could be valuable in finding a job. Enrollment in trade schools and programs has been on the rise across the country, a sign young people are not giving up on manufacturing jobs anytime soon. “More kids are realizing they can go out and earn a great living with an amazing career and making very good money,” Matt Scott, a welding instructor at Portland Community College in Oregon, told KATU in July.",right
"Opinion: Why not a Commonwealth free trade deal? Its members have a common language and legal tradition that make trade among them a natural. U.S. protectionism now makes it imperative It is time to reinvigorate and repurpose the loose association of historically bound counterparties that is the (British) “Commonwealth of Nations” by establishing a comprehensive Commonwealth Free Trade Agreement (CFTA). This is not nostalgic reverie for a bygone imperial age, but a 21st-century strategy built on a solid institutional foundation that has considerable potential for, as its name says, wealth. The raw numbers are impressive. The Commonwealth is a market of 2.5 billion people — a third of the world’s population — with a combined GDP of over US$13 trillion in 2021 and on track to surpass $19.5 trillion by 2027. The four most populous Commonwealth countries — India, Pakistan, Nigeria and Bangladesh — alone account for approximately 1.7 billion consumers. Moreover, 60 per cent of Commonwealth citizens are under the age of 30, representing the next great wave of global consumers, entrepreneurs and workers. This is not a niche bloc; it is a potential economic powerhouse. The Commonwealth’s greatest asset is its intangible capital. The shared legacy of the English language, the common law, and remarkably congruent business, legal and administrative cultures is a unique advantage that other multinational blocs struggle to approximate. A Toronto company can negotiate a contract in Singapore or Accra with a fluency and mutual understanding far harder to achieve in Shanghai or São Paulo, thus dramatically reducing the costs and frictions of doing business. Far from being a colonial anachronism, the Commonwealth has evolved into a voluntary, if underused, partnership of equals. Not acknowledging its complex colonial past would be a strategic error, but so would being shackled by that past. Whatever may have been the source of Commonwealth countries’ shared attributes, today’s goal should be to exploit them for mutual economic gain in a precarious world. - Terence Corcoran: A clear message from Javier Milei & Ronald Reagan - William Watson: Tell Canadians: What does the U.S. want and what won’t we give? - Advertisement 1Story continues below Modern trade is not a zero-sum game and CFTA would not conflict with members’ other obligations. Membership in one agreement does not preclude belonging to another; it brings options and resilience. India could still be a member of the BRICS. The United Kingdom could still join the CPTPP. A CFTA would not seek to duplicate that agreement’s regulatory alignment. A CFTA could focus on tariff reduction and dispute resolution, serving developing Commonwealth nations as a more accessible first step that complements the deeper ties its more advanced members already enjoy elsewhere. An expansive view suggests even Hong Kong might join a CFTA. At least in theory, as a “Separate Customs Territory” of China it retains the right to enter into free trade agreements independently of Beijing. Before 1999 it was a Commonwealth member. Welcoming it into a CFTA could provide a crucial gateway to trade with China while respecting the complex realities of international law. Ideas for deeper Commonwealth economic integration have circulated for decades, but they have lacked urgency and political will. But now the United States abandonment of the post-war consensus on trade, the current proliferation of tariffs and the need for supply chain diversification post-pandemic, post-Ukraine and post-Trump provide ample motivation. Reconciling the interests of advanced economies with those of developing nations is always a challenge. But political dialogue is already formalized in the annual Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings. And though many important Commonwealth members traditionally have been leery of free trade, that does seem to be changing. For example, India and Britain finalized the India-U.K. Free Trade Agreement in July. Perhaps this could be the seed from which the CFTA grows. As the world passes through what seems to be a geopolitical inflection point, the Commonwealth offers a ready-made framework for a new kind of trade bloc — built, not on geographic contiguity, but on deep-rooted compatibility. The Commonwealth can be a network of trust in a world losing faith. Its leaders, Canada among them should seize the opportunity and transform an often overlooked alliance into the foundation of a new, more resilient global economy.

"NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh IT minister Nara Lokesh said the state govt has reduced power tariffs for shrimp farmers to address a key disadvantage against rivals such as Ecuador after the US tariffs. ""Our closest competitor, Ecuador, had 16% tariffs, so the difference was around 34%. I sat with the ministers, we interacted with the industry, and we proactively looked at how we could assist them. One of the measures was a reduction of power tariffs for the shrimp farmers. It was close to Rs 4, and now it's down to Rs 1.5, which itself gives a lot of relief,"" he said, adding that new export markets such as Russia and Australia have been explored for the state's industry as well. 'Love Us Again': Donald Trump Offers Fair Trade Deal, Promises To Reduce India Tariffs After Tension Speaking at a press conference, the minister said that Andhra Pradesh secured firm investment commitments of $120 billion across sectors and aimed to generate 7 lakh jobs. He said every policy rolled out by the state govt is aimed at creating employment and fostering industrial growth.",right
"Fortune 500 companies are facing a reckoning, as the traditional playbook of scale, efficiency, and seamless global integration falters as the world drifts away from globalization. There’s “incredibly high stakes” on the geopolitical front heading into 2026, James Crabtree, distinguished visiting fellow on the European Council on Foreign Relations, said on Monday during the Fortune Innovation Forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Despite the “shaky truce” between U.S. President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping agreed last month, the landscape is still littered with “unexploded ordinance,” he warned. The China-U.S. rivalry creates both opportunities and risks for Southeast Asia. The region has long tried to stay relatively neutral in superpower conflict, yet worsening tensions between Washington and Beijing could lead to pressure to pick a side. But “it’s not about making a choice, it’s about navigating the opportunities,” said Dato’ Siobhan Das, chief executive officer of the American Malaysian Chamber of Commerce. While Southeast Asia has long succeeded by offering a growth-friendly ecosystem for multinational companies, the region must cultivate new competitive advantages to meet shifting global dynamics. Take Malaysia: panelists pointed to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s recent trade engagement with the U.S. as an example of how middle economies can stay nimble and relevant.During his meeting with Trump, Anwar secured tariff relief on key exports and bolstered diplomatic ties with Washington. Taking advantage of the face-to-face meeting, Anwar secured tariff relief on key exports and bolstered diplomatic ties. Diversification is another tool that countries can use, Das noted, pointing to Malaysia’s new focus on emerging markets in Africa, South America and the Middle East. But diversification has limits, she warned. “In the high-tech space, there are not that many countries that you’re going to be exporting to.” Geopolitics is entering the digital world too. Middle powers must strengthen their “sovereign AI” strategies to protect their interests, argued Vivek Luthra, senior managing director at Accenture. (Sovereign AI is a push to develop and operate AI using locally-developed models and infrastructure, avoiding being too reliant on technology entirely developed in foreign countries like the U.S. or China) “Countries want to control the overall value chain from chips to insight,” he said, noting that technology is now a matter of economic security, not just a driver of economic growth. Size and scale may be poor protection in a more geopolitically complex world. Yuelin Yang, a board member on the Asian Corporate Governance Association, warned that corporate complexity could now be a liability. Multinational corporations now have to quickly and accurately filter huge amounts of data for decision-makers at headquarters. By contrast, a smaller, locally-focused family firm could be better positioned to adapt to change, Yang suggested. Panelists expressed a mix of caution and optimism when it came to forecasts for 2026. Inflation and structural costs are likely to rise as countries and companies pivot from pure efficiency toward security, resiliency, and redundancy. Yet ASEAN is far from a bystander, as panelists cited the region’s young population, attractiveness to foreign direct investment, and potential for deeper collaboration with trading partnersas reasons for optimism amid global turbulence.",right
"As the Supreme Court prepares to hear one of the most consequential economic cases in decades—the legality of President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs—one of the original architects of his trade agenda says the president has gone too far to turn back. Wilbur Ross, who, as the president’s commerce secretary from 2017 to 2021, helped design the first wave of Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs during his first term, told Fortune a total defeat from the Supreme Court is unlikely. But even if it comes, Trump won’t walk away. “He’s too committed to the tariff to give it up,” Ross said. “If they lose, I don’t think he’s just going to say, ‘Well, okay, it didn’t work under this law, I’ll give it up.’ He’s too invested.” A weaker case—and a bigger gamble The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday about whether Trump exceeded his authority by using emergency powers to levy tariffs on more than 100 countries and nearly every U.S. trading partner. Technically, according to Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress, not the president, has the right to “lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.” Tariffs, as a duty, fall under the category of requiring congressional approval. However, to surpass that, the Trump administration has invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, which allows the president during “national emergencies” to take regulatory action, to impose tariffs, though the act does not mention duties. It isn’t the first time Trump has found a legal workaround to act unilaterally on trade: In 2018, Ross helped Trump craft an exemption under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to launch the first round of tariffs on China and other countries. Then, Ross said, his team held public hearings, consulted with industries and trading partners, and built a lengthy administrative record anticipating court challenges. “We were upheld throughout,” he recalled. “That gave a better definition to what the government could do.” This time, however, Ross noted the administration “didn’t do much” of the same administrative process, meaning Trump’s team is entering the court on weaker ground than before. “They were in a hurry to get things going,” he said. “That’s taking a bit more risk.” The stakes are huge. Trump has used the emergency statute to impose tariffs on goods in every hemisphere, upending markets for months and generating approximately $195 billion in revenue for the government, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). The lawsuits before the Supreme Court—brought by importers and small manufacturers—claim the president’s sweeping use of emergency powers violates congressional authority to tax and regulate trade. Trump’s lawyers argue the IEEPA’s broad language, allowing presidents to “regulate” commerce during “unusual and extraordinary threats,” gives him wide discretion to act. His critics counter that calling trade deficits an “emergency” stretches the statute’s meaning beyond recognition. Ross sees the case as a toss-up, but predicts the court won’t overturn the entire program. Striking all the tariffs, he warned, would create global turmoil. “That would be a pretty horrific decision,” he said, adding it would force difficult questions about who exactly would be repaid: importers, consumers, or companies that passed costs down the supply chain. He said he believes the justices are more likely to “cherry-pick” a few tariffs that seem politically motivated, while leaving the rest of the system intact. As an example of a tariff he thinks is likely to be struck down, he pointed to the 40% duty on Brazilian imports—on top of a 10% levy earlier in the year—that Trump imposed owing to the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. “However bad” the prosecution of Bolsonaro is, Ross said, “it’s hard to conceive that constitutes an emergency for the U.S.” The former commerce secretary also said he believed tariffs on individual, menial goods like “brooms” or houseware items would be unlikely to meet the standard set by the IEEPA. However, he said, other cases constituted a national emergency, such as Trump imposing tariffs on Mexico, China, and Canada to halt the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. Markets fear uncertainty more than defeat Even if the court narrows Trump’s authority, Ross said the president is unlikely to abandon tariffs altogether. “He’s too committed,” he said again. Instead, Trump could seek a new legal basis for his actions or push Congress to codify the measures. He noted union support for protectionist policies has blurred traditional partisan lines, though, in the current political climate, Democrats may be more inclined to oppose Trump than to defend their traditional pro-labor position. Ross, known in business circles as the “King of Bankruptcy” for restructuring struggling industries before joining the administration, sees the current fight as a familiar risk–reward play. The danger, he said, isn’t just losing the case, but also creating ambiguity for companies that depend on predictable trade rules. “Markets can adjust to good news or bad news,” he said. “What markets have trouble with is uncertainty.”",right
"The world has changed so profoundly that even the rhythm of the year is not what it used to be. The summer break isn’t a true break any longer — a good summer these days is one that goes by without a major global crisis. But there is always a lot going on, and our hyperconnected world makes it impossible not to keep paying attention. Since the start of the year, we have all been relentlessly focused on a series of important issues: tariff negotiations, inflation and employment data, concerns about Fed independence, geopolitical tensions both acute and simmering, and ever greater advances and investments in AI. As we enter the final stretch of the year, it’s the right time for a reset, the natural juncture to refocus on the business challenges ahead and how we intend to tackle them. For business leaders, the greatest challenge today comes from pervasive heightened uncertainty. The U.S. administration has set out to reshape the global trading system; accelerating digital innovation continues to transform the global economy; tighter immigration policy has caused a sudden shock to the U.S. labor market; and to make matters worse, declining response rates to surveys have affected the quality of economic statistics, making it harder to gauge macro developments in real time. To handle this multipronged uncertainty, I find it useful to rely on four principles. Four principles First, focus on fundamentals to cut through the noise. In the incessant flow of news and opinions we are exposed to, the ratio of information to noise has worsened considerably – exacerbated by polarization. It can be hard to isolate what matters, but fundamentals eventually do assert themselves. It’s true for economic policies: excess monetary and fiscal stimulus triggered the high inflation of 2021-23; unsustainable public debt trajectories across advanced economies will keep upward pressure on bond yields and will need to be addressed through adjustments in taxes and spending. It’s true for industries and companies: corporations that invest in well-targeted innovation, including AI, should reap greater efficiency and market growth. Fundamentals always matter. That’s why in our investment strategies we place great emphasis on fundamentals research, married with cutting-edge quantitative analysis. Second, keep an open mind. Sometimes, we mistake the way things have always been done for fundamental laws. It’s a convenient shortcut, but it can be misleading. That’s part of the reason why the proposed tariffs have not had the immediate disastrous impact that many predicted. Free trade was never truly free, and reshaping the existing intricate web of trade and non-trade barriers has a more complex gradual impact. And that’s why some classic recession signals have failed in the past few years, from the inverted yield curve to the so-called Sahm rule on changes in unemployment. They were treated as fundamental laws, when they were just empirical regularities already surpassed by a fast-evolving economic structure. Keeping an open mind and looking at the nuances is harder, but it can pay off. Third, keep an eye on the long-term picture. Together with the focus on fundamentals, this helps distinguish cyclical changes from structural turning points. The past decade of near-zero policy interest rates and extremely low bond yields was interpreted by many as a structural change: proof that we had entered an era where inflation would no longer be a danger and bond yields would remain depressed. In 2020 the Fed changed its monetary policy framework to underscore that below-target inflation had become the greatest challenge. It now seems clear that those abnormally low inflation rates and bond yields were a cyclical phenomenon. Current yield levels are much more in line with the decades-long historical average, and the Fed this summer adjusted its policy framework accordingly. Taking a long-term view might seem counterintuitive with innovation moving so fast, but it’s more important than ever. Fourth, keep moving. Operating in an uncertain environment requires agility, and building agility calls for exercising different muscles, building new capabilities and developing a broader range of options. In finance, this means creating and testing new solutions in our own operations and for our clients’ investment strategies, including through the use of AI; experimenting with novel strategies to increase efficiency and broaden access to investment opportunities, for example with crypto- and blockchain-based technologies; and expanding alternative asset offerings to provide greater opportunities to both borrowers and investors. All these steps are tailored to create immediate value for clients and shareholders, but they also serve to create optionality, to broaden the set of tools that will allow us as a company and the industry at large to handle the unforeseen new developments that lie ahead. This volatile environment is both daunting and exciting. The uncertainty surrounding us means we have a lot to learn. But these four principles can help us manage the risks and take advantage of the opportunities that this fast-changing macro environment will present.

"The Fed’s Fault Lines: Tariffs, Labor, and the Battle Over the Next Cut Yesterday we explored how the battle over rate cuts has scrambled old alliances inside the Federal Reserve. Today we look closer at what’s driving that split and what it means for markets. The fault lines no longer run neatly between “hawks” and “doves,” or even between Republican and Democratic appointees. Instead, they cut across both camps, forming unlikely coalitions around two questions: Are tariffs creating durable and significant inflation risks? And is the labor market showing hidden weakness or still running strong? These are not academic disputes. They will decide whether the Fed cuts again in December—or whether Powell’s next move is to hit pause. What follows is a look inside this strange new alignment and why even the data itself may not settle the fight. The seven members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and 12 Reserve Bank presidents attend the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on October 28, 2025. (Federal Reserve via Flickr) The Strange New Division at the Fed Several forces are shaping these coalitions. First, there’s a fundamental disagreement about the nature of current inflation. The dovish camp believes tariff-driven price increases are temporary and should be ”looked through,” much as central banks traditionally ignore oil price shocks. The hawks see something more persistent—inflation that’s been above target for years and shows worrying signs of becoming entrenched. What’s more, many of the hawks brought with them to the Fed a deeply held belief that tariffs are a destructive economic policy, priming them to embrace interpretations in which import duties raise prices. The inflation data so far appears to favor the dovish interpretation. While headline inflation remains elevated at three percent, the cooling in manufacturing price pressures and the attribution of remaining inflation primarily to tariffs suggests the price increases may indeed prove temporary once supply chains adjust. The consumer price index for core goods is up just 1.5 percent. Exclude used cars, and the core goods index is up just 1.1 percent from a year ago. Durable goods price are up just 1.8 percent. Clothing prices are down a tenth of a percentage point. New cars and trucks are up just 0.8 percent. It’s hard to see a lot of tariff pressure in these prices. Second, Fed officials are reading labor market signals differently. Lisa Cook points to rising unemployment among vulnerable populations—youth and Black workers—and growing financial stress among low- and middle-income households. She calls this a ”two-speed economy” where the affluent thrive while others struggle. Michelle Bowman notes the employment-to-population ratio has dropped significantly, suggesting more weakness than headline unemployment numbers reveal. Manufacturing data lends credence to these concerns. One ISM respondent from the chemical products sector captured the prevailing mood: ”Business continues to remain difficult, as customers are canceling and reducing orders due to uncertainty in the global economic environment and regarding the ever-changing tariff landscape.” The ISM report found that 58 percent of the manufacturing sector’s GDP contracted in October. The hawks counter that labor markets remain near full employment by historical standards. They worry that keeping policy too loose risks reigniting inflation without meaningfully helping employment. What’s more, they can point to an economy that appears to be growing quite rapidly, with the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow measure currently clocking in a four percent. December’s High-Stakes Meeting The plunging market odds for a December cut reflect genuine uncertainty about which faction will prevail. Just last week, with inflation data cooperating and the October cut widely anticipated, traders were near-certain the Fed would cut again next month. But as soon as the meeting concluded—with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s cautious language, Jeffrey Schmid’s dissent to hold, and Stephen Miran’s dissent to cut more—that confidence evaporated. The economic data between now and December will be decisive. But we still do not know what economic data will be available due to the government shutdown. This realignment extends beyond monetary policy. It reflects a fundamental shift in how economic policy coalitions are forming across the political spectrum. The old battles between Keynesians and monetarists, between inflation fighters and full employment advocates, are giving way to new fault lines. For now, markets are hedging their bets. At 65 percent, December remains more likely than not to bring another cut. But that’s a far cry from the near-certainty of a week ago. In a central bank as divided as this one, even the most basic near-term policy decisions have become genuinely contested. The incoming data may ultimately vindicate one camp or the other. If inflation continues to moderate while labor markets weaken—as recent manufacturing surveys suggest—the doves will have been proven right. If inflation proves stickier than expected, the hawks’ caution will look prescient. One thing is certain: The December meeting will test whether this divided Fed can navigate between equally unpalatable risks. And unlike past eras, we can no longer predict how officials will vote based on who appointed them. In the new Fed, strange bedfellows make strange monetary policy—and increasingly uncertain outcomes. COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"BMW CEO Presses EU to Ratify US Deal as Tariff Costs Ramp Up BMW AG is pressing the European Union to formally adopt a trade deal with the US that would give the German carmaker respite from ongoing tariff pressure. (Bloomberg) — BMW AG is pressing the European Union to formally adopt a trade deal with the US that would give the German carmaker respite from ongoing tariff pressure. “The United States already implemented their part of the deal, retroactively, as of August 1. The EU has not done so,” Chief Executive Officer Oliver Zipse told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday. Tariffs imposed by the US and EU have weighed on the luxury-car maker’s earnings, with German peers Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Porsche AG also getting hit. The US is BMW’s second-biggest overseas market, and the manufacturer is forced to pay duties for shipping Chinese-made electric Mini models to the EU. While the EU has signed off on a US trade deal that would see tariffs lowered, the agreement still needs to be rubber-stamped by EU lawmakers — a step expected early next year. That means BMW continues to pay tariffs on cars imported to Europe that are made in the US. “It’s imperative that the EU also finalizes and implements the agreed measures promptly,” Zipse said, adding that BMW participated in talks with EU and US trade officials last week. Officials in Brussels aren’t heeding the industry’s concerns about high tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, Zipse said, while Chinese manufacturers don’t face additional levies on hybrid vehicles shipped to the EU. BMW faces EU duties of almost 31% on EVs produced in China. Zipse’s comments come as the industry awaits a European Commission review of its plan to effectively ban sales of new combustion-engine vehicles in a decade. The EU’s appraisal could slip into January from a planned Dec. 10 meeting, Bloomberg reported last week. The German government is pushing Brussels to allow plug-in hybrids, electric cars with combustion-powered range extenders and highly efficient conventional vehicles beyond 2035. The back-and-forth on EVs is putting BMW in an awkward position. The company has spent well over €10 billion on its next-generation Neue Klasse EVs, a bold bet meant to help the Munich-based automaker reclaim the technology lead from Tesla Inc. and BYD Co. The manufacturer last month said that demand for the new line’s first model — the iX3 sport utility vehicle — is exceeding expectations. The company earlier Tuesday set a new target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, including by using more renewable energy sources in production. BMW is under pressure to improve performance in China, where the brand and its German peers are losing market share to local manufacturers. In Europe, where energy and labor costs are high, the auto industry is letting go thousands of workers to become more efficient. To bolster its offering, BMW is mulling adding range extenders to its vehicles amid growing demand for the technology popularized by its Chinese rivals, Bloomberg reported last week. Range-extender vehicles come with a small gasoline engine that doesn’t drive the wheels like in a conventional hybrid, and instead acts as an on-board generator to recharge the battery. —With assistance from Dara Doyle.

During this transition period, Mr. McLeod and ATS’ senior leadership team remain focused on executing the Company’s value creation strategy, as reflected in the strong results delivered this quarter. Second quarter of fiscal 2026 revenues were 18.9% or $115.7 million higher than in the corresponding period a year ago, primarily due to a year-over-year increase in organic revenues (revenues excluding contributions from acquired companies and foreign exchange translation) of 12.6%, alongside a 3.9% positive impact of foreign exchange translation and a 2.4% increase from revenues earned by acquired companies. Revenues generated from construction contracts increased 26.5% or $84.1 million from the prior period primarily due to organic revenue growth on higher Order Backlog entering the period, and the positive impact of foreign exchange translation. Revenues from services increased 3.9% or $6.3 million, primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange translation. Revenues from the sale of goods increased 19.1% or $25.3 million primarily due to revenues earned by acquired companies of $11.4 million, in addition organic revenue growth and the positive impact of foreign exchange translation. By market, revenues generated in life sciences increased $24.1 million or 6.9% year over year. This was primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange translation, in addition to contributions from acquisitions totalling $11.2 million. Revenues generated in food & beverage increased $30.9 million or 32.9% from the corresponding period last year due to organic revenue growth on higher Order Backlog entering the quarter, in addition to the positive impact of foreign exchange translation, and contributions from acquisitions. Revenues generated in consumer products increased $59.9 million or 81.5% year over year primarily due to organic revenue growth on higher Order Backlog entering the quarter. Revenues in transportation decreased $24.4 million or 35.3% year over year due to lower Order Backlog entering the quarter, as the prior year included several large EV projects prior to the removal of Order Backlog related to the Company’s disagreement with one of its EV customers (as disclosed previously in the fiscal 2025 MD&A). Revenues in energy increased $25.2 million or 97.7% year over year due to organic revenue growth on higher Order Backlog entering the quarter. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 was $33.6 million (34 cents per share basic), compared to a net loss of $0.9 million ((1) cent per share basic) for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The increase primarily reflected higher revenues. Adjusted basic earnings per share were 45 cents compared to 25 cents in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Depreciation and amortization expense was $39.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, compared to $39.2 million a year ago. EBITDA was $114.6 million (15.7% EBITDA margin) in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to $61.4 million (10.0% EBITDA margin) in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 included $0.1 million of incremental costs related to acquisition activity, $7.3 million stock-based recovery associated with forfeiture of the former CEO’s unvested awards, and a $3.7 million recovery of stock-based compensation due to revaluation of cash settled awards. EBITDA for the corresponding period in the prior year included $17.1 million of restructuring charges, $0.9 million of incremental costs related to acquisition activity, $0.8 million of acquisition-related fair value adjustments to acquired inventories, and a $1.9 million recovery of stock-based compensation revaluation expenses. Excluding these amounts, adjusted EBITDA was $103.7 million (14.2% adjusted EBITDA margin), compared to $78.3 million (12.8% adjusted EBITDA margin) for the corresponding period in the prior year. Higher adjusted EBITDA primarily reflected increased revenues.

By market, Order Bookings in life sciences decreased compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the prior-year period including several large enterprise Order Bookings, reflecting normal variability. Order Bookings in food & beverage increased compared to the prior-year period primarily due to contributions from acquired companies, in addition to the positive impact of foreign exchange translation. Order Bookings in consumer products increased from the prior period primarily due to timing of customer projects. Order Bookings in transportation increased due to the timing of customer projects. Order Bookings in energy increased compared to the prior-year period primarily due to nuclear refurbishment customer projects. Trailing twelve month book-to-bill ratio at September 28, 2025 was 1.12:1. Book-to-bill ratio, Order Bookings and organic Order Bookings growth are supplementary financial measures – see “Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures. At September 28, 2025, Order Backlog was $2,070 million, 13.5% higher than at September 29, 2024, on account of higher Order Backlog in all markets except for transportation. The life sciences funnel remains strong and diversified, with opportunities in strategic submarkets such as pharmaceuticals, radiopharmaceuticals, and medical devices. Management continues to identify opportunities with both new and existing customers, including those who produce auto-injectors and wearable devices for diabetes and obesity treatments, diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, contact lenses and pre-filled syringes, automated pharmacy solutions, as well as opportunities to provide life science solutions that leverage integrated capabilities from across ATS. ATS serves customers in laboratory research where government funding in the U.S. currently faces challenges. However, management has not seen a material impact on its overall life sciences funnel activity. Funnel activity in food & beverage remains strong. The Company continues to benefit from strong brand recognition within global tomato processing, as well as other soft fruits and vegetable processing industries. There is also continued demand for automated solutions within the food & beverage market more broadly, in areas such as secondary processing and packaging. Funnel activity in consumer products is stable, although discretionary spending by consumers, influenced by factors such as inflationary pressures, may impact timing of some customer investments in the Company’s solutions. In transportation, the funnel consists of smaller opportunities relative to the size of Order Bookings in fiscal years 2023 and 2024. ATS is positioned to deploy its specialized capabilities, including in electric vehicle (“EV”) battery assembly, to support customers as opportunities arise. Funnel activity in energy remains strong and includes longer-term opportunities in the nuclear industry. The Company is focused on clean energy applications including solutions for the refurbishment of nuclear power plants, early participation in the new reactor build market, including small modular reactors, and grid battery storage. Customers seeking to de-risk or enhance supply chain resiliency, address skilled worker shortages or combat higher labour costs present ongoing and future opportunities for ATS. Management believes that the underlying trends driving customer demand for ATS solutions, including rising labour constraints, production onshoring or reshoring and the need for scalable, high-quality, energy-efficient production, remain favourable. In addition, funnel growth in markets where sustainability requirements are a focus for customers — including nuclear and grid battery storage, as well as consumer goods packaging — provides ATS with opportunities to use its capabilities to respond to customer needs, including global and regional requirements to reduce carbon emissions. Order Backlog of $2,070 million is expected to help mitigate some of the impact of quarterly variability in Order Bookings on revenues in the short term. The Company’s Order Backlog includes several large enterprise programs that have longer periods of performance and therefore longer revenue recognition cycles, particularly in life sciences. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, management expects to generate revenues in the range of $700 million to $740 million. This estimate is calculated each quarter based on management’s assessment of project schedules across all customer contracts in Order Backlog, expectations for faster-turn product and services revenues, expected delivery timing of third-party equipment and operational capacity. Supplier lead times are generally acceptable across key categories; however, inflationary or other cost increases (see “Tariffs”), and price and lead-time volatility may continue to disrupt the timing and progress of the Company’s margin expansion efforts and may affect revenue recognition. Over time, achieving management’s margin target assumes that the Company will successfully implement its margin expansion initiatives, and that such initiatives will result in improvements to its adjusted earnings from operations margin that offset these shorter-term pressures (see “Forward-Looking Statements” for a description of the risks underlying the achievement of the margin target in future periods). The timing and geographies of customer capital expenditure decisions on larger opportunities can cause variability in Order Bookings from quarter to quarter (see “Tariffs”). Revenues in a given period are dependent on a combination of the volume of outstanding projects the Company is contracted to perform, the size and duration of those projects, and the timing of project activities including design, assembly, testing, and installation. Given the specialized nature of the Company’s offerings, the size and scope of projects vary based on customer needs. The Company seeks to achieve revenue growth organically and by identifying strategic acquisition opportunities that provide access to attractive end- markets and new products and technologies and deliver hurdle-rate returns. After-sales revenues and reoccurring revenues, which ATS defines as revenues from ancillary products and services associated with equipment sales, and revenues from customers who purchase non-customized ATS product at regular intervals, are expected to provide some balance to customers’ capital expenditure cycles. The Company continues to target improvements in non-cash working capital. Over the long term, the Company expects to continue investing in non-cash working capital to support growth, with some fluctuations expected on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The Company’s long-term goal is to maintain its investment in non-cash working capital as a percentage of annualized revenues below 15%. The Company expects that continued cash flows from operations, together with cash and cash equivalents on hand and credit available under operating and long-term credit facilities will be sufficient to fund its requirements for investments in non-cash working capital and capital assets, and to fund strategic investment plans including some potential acquisitions. Acquisitions could result in additional debt or equity financing requirements for the Company. Non-cash working capital as a percentage of revenues is a non-IFRS ratio — see “Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures.” The Company continues to make progress in line with its plans to integrate acquired companies, and expects to realize cost and revenue synergies consistent with announced integration plans. The Company periodically undertakes reviews of its operations to ensure alignment with strategic market opportunities. As a part of this review, the Company has identified an opportunity to improve the cost structure of the organization to reallocate resources to strategic focus areas and improve operational efficiencies. Actions are expected to begin in the third quarter of fiscal 2026 and continue to the end of the fiscal year. The Company anticipates total restructuring expenses to be approximately $15 million. The majority of the Company’s shipments from Canada into the U.S. fall within the current terms of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (“USMCA”). However, the U.S. has imposed tariffs on certain goods from various jurisdictions globally, including Canada, and counter-tariffs have also been enacted. Management continues to actively monitor the situation and is taking steps to mitigate risks where possible and is continuing to offer support to customers based on their needs, which may include onshoring or reshoring production. Supply chain impacts resulting from shifting trade dynamics have been largely mitigated through alternative sourcing, along with pricing strategies. While the Company could see impacts over time arising from unmitigated costs related to the tariffs themselves, potential supplier price increases, and the timing and geographic shifts in customers’ capital deployment, ATS’ global footprint and decentralized operating model, supported by the ABM, provide some flexibility to address potential disruptions over the long term. On a trailing twelve month basis, the Company’s equipment and product adjusted revenues from its Canadian and European operations being sold into the U.S. remained consistent with the range previously disclosed (just over 20% of the Company’s total adjusted revenues for the year ended March 31, 2025).

Measures Throughout this document, management uses certain non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS ratios and supplementary financial measures to evaluate the performance of the Company. The terms “EBITDA”, “organic revenue”, “adjusted net income”, “adjusted earnings from operations”, “adjusted revenues”, “adjusted EBITDA”, “pro forma adjusted EBITDA”, “adjusted basic earnings per share”, and “free cash flow”, are non-IFRS financial measures, “EBITDA margin”, “adjusted earnings from operations margin”, “adjusted EBITDA margin”, “organic revenue growth”, “non-cash working capital as a percentage of revenues”, and “net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA” are non-IFRS ratios, and “operating margin”, “Order Bookings”, “organic Order Bookings”, “organic Order Bookings growth”, “Order Backlog”, and “book-to-bill ratio” are supplementary financial measures, all of which do not have any standardized meaning prescribed within IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Such measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, management uses “earnings from operations”, which is an additional IFRS measure, to evaluate the performance of the Company. Earnings from operations is presented on the Company’s consolidated statements of income as net income excluding income tax expense and net finance costs. Operating margin is an expression of the Company’s earnings from operations as a percentage of revenues. EBITDA is defined as earnings from operations excluding depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is an expression of the Company’s EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. Organic revenue is defined as revenues in the stated period excluding revenues from acquired companies for which the acquired company was not a part of the consolidated group in the comparable period. Organic revenue growth compares the stated period organic revenue with the reported revenue of the comparable prior period. Adjusted earnings from operations is defined as earnings from operations before items excluded from management’s internal analysis of operating results, such as amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, restructuring charges, legal settlement costs that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, the mark-to-market adjustment on stock- based compensation and certain other adjustments which would be non-recurring in nature (“adjustment items”). Adjusted earnings from operations margin is an expression of the Company’s adjusted earnings from operations as a percentage of revenues. Adjusted revenues are defined as revenues before any adjustment items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as adjusted earnings from operations excluding depreciation and amortization. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA is adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis to reflect full contribution from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin is an expression of the entity’s adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. Adjusted basic earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income on a basic per share basis, where adjusted net income is defined as adjusted earnings from operations less net finance costs and income tax expense, plus tax effects of adjustment items and adjusted for other significant items of a non-recurring nature. Non- cash working capital as a percentage of revenues is defined as the sum of accounts receivable, contract assets, inventories, deposits, prepaids and other assets, less accounts payable, accrued liabilities, provisions and contract liabilities divided by the trailing two fiscal quarter revenues annualized. Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less property, plant and equipment and intangible asset expenditures. Net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA is the ratio of the net debt of the Company (cash and cash equivalents less bank indebtedness, long-term debt, and lease liabilities) to the trailing twelve month pro forma adjusted EBITDA. Order Bookings represent new orders for the supply of automation systems, services and products that management believes are firm. Organic Order Bookings are defined as Order Bookings in the stated period excluding Order Bookings from acquired companies for which the acquired company was not a part of the consolidated group in the comparable period. Organic Order Bookings growth compares the stated period organic Order Bookings with the reported Order Bookings of the comparable prior period. Order Backlog is the estimated unearned portion of revenues on customer contracts that are in process and have not been completed at the specified date. Book to bill ratio is a measure of Order Bookings compared to adjusted revenue. Following amendments to ATS’ RSU Plan in 2022 to provide the Company with the option for settlement in shares purchased in the open market and the creation of the employee benefit trust to facilitate such settlement, ATS began to account for equity-settled RSUs using the equity method of accounting. However, prior RSU grants which will be cash-settled and DSU grants which will be cash-settled are accounted for as described in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and have volatility period over period based on the fluctuating price of ATS’ common shares. Certain non-IFRS financial measures (adjusted EBITDA, net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings from operations and adjusted basic earnings per share) exclude the impact on stock-based compensation expense of the revaluation of DSUs and RSUs resulting specifically from the change in market price of the Company’s common shares between periods. Management believes that this adjustment provides insight into the Company’s performance, as share price volatility drives variability in the Company’s stock-based compensation expense. Operating margin, adjusted earnings from operations, adjusted revenues, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, pro forma adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are used by the Company to evaluate the performance of its operations. Management believes that earnings from operations is an important indicator in measuring the performance of the Company’s operations on a pre-tax basis and without consideration as to how the Company finances its operations. Management believes that adjusted revenues, organic revenue and organic revenue growth, when considered with IFRS measures, allow the Company to better measure the Company’s performance and evaluate long-term performance trends. Organic revenue growth also facilitates easier comparisons of the Company’s performance with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to its peers. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are important indicators of the Company’s ability to generate operating cash flows to fund continued investment in its operations. Management believes that adjusted earnings from operations, adjusted earnings from operations margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted basic earnings per share are important measures to increase comparability of performance between periods. The adjustment items used by management to arrive at these metrics are not considered to be indicative of the business’ ongoing operating performance. Management uses the measure “non-cash working capital as a percentage of revenues” to assess overall liquidity. Free cash flow is used by the Company to measure cash flow from operations after investment in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Management uses net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA as a measurement of leverage of the Company. Order Bookings provide an indication of the Company’s ability to secure new orders for work during a specified period, while Order Backlog provides a measure of the value of Order Bookings that have not been completed at a specified point in time. Both Order Bookings and Order Backlog are indicators of future revenues that the Company expects to generate based on contracts that management believes to be firm. Organic Order Bookings and organic Order Bookings growth allow the Company to better measure the Company’s performance and evaluate long- term performance trends. Organic Order Bookings growth also facilitates easier comparisons of the Company’s performance with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to its peers. Book to bill ratio is used to measure the Company’s ability and timeliness to convert Order Bookings into revenues. Management believes that ATS shareholders and potential investors in ATS use these additional IFRS measures and non-IFRS financial measures in making investment decisions and measuring operational results. A reconciliation of (i) adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA to net income, (ii) adjusted earnings from operations to net income, (iii) adjusted net income to net income, (iv) adjusted basic earnings per share to basic earnings per share (v) free cash flow to its IFRS measure components and (vi) organic revenue to revenue, in each case for the three- and six-months ended September 28, 2025 and September 29, 2024 is contained in this document (see “Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures to IFRS Measures”). This document also contains a reconciliation of (i) non-cash working capital as a percentage of revenues and (ii) net debt to their IFRS measure components, in each case at both September 28, 2025 and March 31, 2025 (see “Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures to IFRS Measures”). A reconciliation of Order Bookings and Order Backlog to total Company revenues for the three- and six-months ended September 28, 2025 and September 29, 2024 is also contained in this news release (see “Order Backlog Continuity”).

"The Supreme Court weighed the legality of President Donald Trump’s use of an emergency law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on most U.S. trading partners on Wednesday — a blockbuster case, and one that experts say stretches far beyond matters of economic policy. At issue before the court is whether the president can use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose two sweeping sets of tariffs on most countries, including a 10% global tariff Trump announced in April and the higher so-called reciprocal tariffs imposed on nearly 50 countries. Trump said at the time that trade deficits amounted to ""the precipice of an economic and national-security crisis"" sufficient to trigger his powers under IEEPA. Justices focused very little of their questions Wednesday on the economic impacts of Trump’s tariff plans. Rather, the majority of the time during oral arguments centered on the IEEPA statute at the heart of the case, its applicability to tariffs or taxation powers — and what guardrails, if any, exist to limit the whims of an executive, should the high court rule in Trump’s favor. The law in question authorizes the president to ""regulate … importation"" during a declared national emergency, but it does not mention the word ""tariffs."" In arguments, the administration told justices that IEEPA's allows a president to ""regulate"" ""importation"" of goods, which they said is the practical equivalent of a ""tariff."" TRUMP TARIFF PLAN FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS COURT BATTLES INTENSIFY But several conservative justices questioned that, saying a tariff amounted to a tax on consumers. ""Is the constitutional assignment of the taxing power to Congress, the power to reach into the pockets of the American people, just different?"" Justice Neil Gorsuch asked, referring back to the founding of the country. Justice Amy Coney Barrett followed up, asking if there has ""ever been another instance in which a statute has used that language to confer the power"" that Trump seeks. Other conservative justices questioned whether an ""economic equivalent"" to tariffs could be used by the president under the law, such as sanctions, embargos, licenses, and quotas. The two consolidated cases, Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, mark the first time during Trump's second term that the Supreme Court will review his policies fully on its merits, rather than through the so-called shadow docket, where justices have often sided with the administration in granting temporary stays and other emergency actions. Unlike other cases, this one also centers on an issue Trump considers to be the signature economic policy of his second term. ""Tomorrow’s United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our country,"" Trump said in a post on social media Tuesday night, adding that, without it, the U.S. is ""virtually defenseless against other countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us."" Lawyers for the Trump administration have argued in lower courts that the IEEPA allows a president to act in response to ""unusual and extraordinary threats"" and in cases where a national emergency has been declared. Trump has claimed that deep and ""sustained"" trade deficits amount to a national emergency that allows him to invoke IEEPA. Plaintiffs counter that in the 50 years since its passage, the law has never been used by a president to impose tariffs and that permitting the president to do so would drastically expand his powers at the expense of other branches of government. They contended to lower courts that Trump’s use of IEEPA to address the trade deficit is unlawful, pointing out that, by the administration’s own admission, the trade deficit has persisted for nearly 50 years, which they say undermines any claim of an ""unusual and extraordinary"" emergency. US COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE SIDES WITH TRUMP IN TARIFF CASE Justices on Wednesday immediately jumped into what's known as the ""major question doctrine."" Plaintiffs in the case have repeatedly argued that Trump’s use of IEEPA violates the doctrine — which requires Congress to be explicit when it hands the executive branch powers to make decisions with a vast economic or political significance. ""Congress does not (and could not) use such vague terminology to grant the executive virtually unconstrained taxing power of such staggering economic effect — literally trillions of dollars — shouldered by American businesses and consumers,"" they told the court in an earlier briefing. U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer acknowledged to the justices that IEEPA does not explicitly give an executive the power to regulate tariffs, though he argued that the power to tariff is ""the natural common sense inference"" of the 1977 law. Justices pressed Sauer as to why Trump invoked IEEPA to impose his sweeping tariffs, noting that doing so would be the first time a president used the law to set import taxes on trading partners. Barrett grilled Sauer at length on this issue, asking if he could point to ""any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase together — 'regulate importation' — has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority."" They also noted that, unlike other statutes that delegate tariff authority to the president, IEEPA does not mention the word tariff, and some of the justices seemed skeptical of the administration's assertion that they do not need additional permission from Congress to use the law in such a sweeping manner. TRUMP WARNS SUPREME COURT TARIFF SHOWDOWN IS ‘LIFE OR DEATH’ FOR AMERICA Justice Elena Kagan pressed Sauer on the Trump administration's contention that IEEPA is only narrowly reviewable by the courts. ""We agree that it's a major power, but it's in the context of a statute that is explicitly conferring major powers,"" Sauer said. ""That the point of the statute is to confer major powers to address major questions — which are emergencies."" ""So it would be unusual to say, look at the statute, say we're not going to find a major power. Well, but the exercise of the power is to impose tariffs. "" That prompted a follow-up question from Gorsuch, who asked, ""Could Congress delegate to the president the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations as he sees fit and collect duties as he sees fit?"" Gorsuch appeared skeptical of the administration's use of IEEPA, which would essentially cut out congressional oversight on the tariffs enacted under the law, and limit judicial review. Barrett and Gorsuch used their time to ask about the balance of powers, and how Congress could ever get the tariff delegation back if it was allocated to Trump under IEEPA. Both justices posed a string of pointed questions to Sauer on the broad latitude that would be granted to Trump under the law, and their skepticism could prove telling in how the court eventually decides the case. It's unclear how the court might rule on the matter, though Trump's laser-focus on the case was on sharp display, including with the attendance of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Neal Katyal, who helped argue the case on behalf of the plaintiffs, told justices Wednesday that Trump has ""torn up the entire tariff architecture."" Chief Justice John Roberts pressed Katyal on the foreign policy issues at play, noting that, unlike taxes, tariffs deal explicitly with foreign powers — which could give the president more latitude to act. ""It implicates, very directly, the president’s foreign affairs power,"" Roberts noted at one point during the exchange. Judges for lower appeals courts previously pressed lawyers for the administration to explain why Trump invoked IEEPA when there are other, more narrow statutes enacted by Congress to specifically deal with tariffs. These laws include certain caps on tariff amounts, as well as timeframes reviewable by Congress. IEEPA, however, does not mention the word tariffs at all. Barrett and other justices nodded to this Wednesday in their own questions. ""Here, you’re talking about something that is exclusively committed to Congress in Article One,"" Katyal said. ""When you have delegations, I would say — even when you have delegations in some military cases and emergency statutes — they have all sorts of limits."" Lower courts sided with plaintiffs from Democratic states and a coalition of small businesses against Trump, with a three-judge panel for the Court of International Trade ruling this summer that Trump's authorities under IEEPA are not ""unbounded."" Appealing to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department has argued that ""denial of tariff authority would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses."" Sauer said in an earlier court filing that nullifying the tariffs would have ""catastrophic consequences"" for national security and global supply chains. The original lawsuits were brought in part by two related third-generation family-owned businesses who make ""hands-on educational toys and products for children,"" according to legal briefs filed by Learning Resources and hand2mind's, whose lawsuit was one of two consolidated cases reviewed by the high court. Their products are developed and manufactured partly in the U.S. About 60% of the assembly is outsourced overseas to several Asian countries, including China and Thailand. Rick Woldenberg, CEO of the two Chicago-area companies founded by his grandfather more than a century ago, said that a Supreme Court ruling for the Trump administration could put him out of business, and predicted that the tariffs would increase from $2.3 million in 2024 to $100.2 million this year. ""I wish I had $100 million,"" he told Fox News in an interview. ""Honest to God, no exaggeration: It feels like the end of days."" Woldenberg said Trump's call to return manufacturing back to the U.S. is not practical, at least for his small businesses. ""I have been looking for American manufacturers for a long time,"" he said, ""and I have come up with zero companies to partner with."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Experts say the impact of this case could stretch far beyond tariffs. A ruling in Trump's favor could cement a broad precedent for future administrations, which could then invoke national emergencies as a pretext to act without congressional review on a wide range of issues. Ultimately, ""this is a separation of powers issue,"" Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel for the Liberty Justice Center and counsel for plaintiffs in one of the consolidated cases, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""It's not about this president,"" he said, speaking on the eve of the oral arguments. ""It's about all presidents and the power that they have under the Constitution, and the powers that they don't have under the Constitution, and whether Congress can delegate those powers — and, if it does, how broad can those powers be?"" ""Everybody should be concerned about that,"" he said. ""Because even if you like what the president is doing now, you might not like what a future president does with the same power.""",right
"Renaissance Macro economist Neil Dutta says the Federal Reserve is on the verge of making a serious policy mistake as various officials drift toward keeping rates steady instead of cutting next month. Dutta argues in a client note published Monday that officials have misread the labor market, overstated inflation risks, and are now preparing to abandon proactive policy as conditions deteriorate. The inflation picture, Dutta writes, looks far less threatening than the hawks contend. Throughout 2025, the narrative around tariff pass-through has shifted repeatedly. First came predictions that firms would raise prices preemptively. Then the theory was that companies would draw down inventories first. Now officials are waiting for price increases to arrive next year. Yet inflation has consistently disappointed these predictions. “What’s clear is that since tariffs have been put on, inflation has generally come in weaker than expected,” Dutta writes. “This would imply less pass-through than expected.” Core PCE has moderated over six months. Used car prices, which lead consumer inflation by roughly three months, have plummeted. Rental inflation is weakening. Restaurants are holding prices to preserve market share. The disinflationary pressures are mounting, not receding. On the labor market, Dutta delivers an equally withering assessment. The problem isn’t tight labor supply from immigration enforcement, he argues. It’s flagging demand. Job vacancies are declining. Underemployment is rising. The payroll diffusion index—a gauge of whether job gains are concentrated in a few sectors or spread broadly across the economy—has stayed below 50 percent since April, meaning weakness is spreading across industries. Real wages are falling fastest for workers most likely to compete with undocumented immigrants, the opposite of what tight labor supply would produce. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has leaned heavily on low jobless claims as evidence of stability. Dutta says Powell is reading the data incorrectly. “Initial claims are less a leading indicator and more an indicator that just happens to come out every week,” he writes. Claims tend rise after hiring has already declined sharply, not before. Waiting for claims to rise when other indicators point to labor market softness risks putting the Fed behind the curve. “When companies like Verizon, Amazon, and Target are all announcing layoffs around the same time, one would expect at least some follow-through into measures like initial claims,” Dutta writes. The gravest risk, Dutta warns, isn’t what the Fed does in December. It’s what skipping December signals. “If the Fed does nothing next month, they won’t do anything in January. You don’t skip one month if you think you are going the next,” he writes. Skipping signals that the central bank has abandoned proactive policy and will wait for obvious damage before acting.

"- In today’s CEO Daily: Diane Brady digs into Warren Buffett’s ‘farewell’ letter. - The big story: SoftBank sells its Nvidia stake. - The markets: Mixed, with U.S. futures down. - Plus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune. Good morning. The U.S. celebrates Veteran’s Day today, and we are sending a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has served. Speaking of gratitude, Warren Buffett dropped his ‘farewell’ letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders yesterday and offered a master class in introspection, recognizing his own good luck, and passing on sage advice. I’d highly recommend reading the letter in its entirety, but here are a few lessons for leaders I think are worth underscoring: Curb Your Envy: “What often bothers very wealthy CEOs—they are human, after all—is that other CEOs are getting even richer. Envy and greed walk hand in hand. And what consultant ever recommended a serious cut in CEO compensation or board payments?” Learn From Failure: “Don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes—learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve.” Measure Success Through Impact: “Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government. When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless. Whether you are religious or not, it’s hard to beat The Golden Rule as a guide to behavior.” Ponder Your Legacy: Buffett talks about how FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, once revered by Americans in the 1930s, “became disgraced for misusing his post.” His advice: “Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it … You will never be perfect, but you can always be better.” Bet on America: “Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management. Don’t despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.” Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Top news Softbank offloads Nvidia Softbank on Tuesday sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia, pocketing $5.8 billion in a surprise move. Masayoshi Son’s company more than doubled its quarterly net profit thanks in large part to its bet on OpenAI. Shutdown may ease A splinter group of Democrats joined Senate Republicans in passing a measure to reopen the government on Monday night. The legislation now goes to the House, which is expected to take it up no later than Wednesday. Meanwhile, flight cancellations and delays spread amid a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay. President Trump on Monday threatened to “dock” the pay of any controllers who take time off. CoreWeave results AI data-center and infrastructure operator CoreWeave nearly doubled its revenue backlog to $55.6 billion, surpassing a critical Wall Street benchmark, though its debt increased and it revised down its full-year revenue guidance. Investors are following CoreWeave closely since it could be “a potential canary-like indicator of weakness in the AI ramp-up,” Fortune’s Amanda Gerut reports. Turmoil at the BBC The crisis at the BBC deepened on Monday after President Trump threatened to sue the broadcaster for $1 billion over the erroneous editing of a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021. Two BBC executives have already resigned over the matter; the president has demanded an apology and compensation for “harm caused.” The real cost of Trump’s tariff dividend President Trump’s proposed $2,000 tariff dividend for all Americans (excluding “high income people”) will cost more than twice the revenue generated by tariffs, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found. The extra cost would have to be added to the already ballooning federal deficit. UBS economists’ labor market concerns UBS economists in their latest “US Economics Weekly” note compared the national labor market to a bathtub that is losing water (total jobs) as layoffs persist and the flow of jobs slows. “That is a material risk to the outlook,” the investment bank wrote.

"Trump's Canada envoy sees trade talks resuming after sudden halt Discussions between the longtime allies have been on ice since Ontario's ad campaign The U.S. ambassador in Ottawa said Canada and the U.S. have a chance to reach an agreement to reduce tariffs despite last month’s diplomatic blowup when U.S. President Donald Trump angrily halted negotiations. Until about a month ago, the two countries had been making progress on a limited deal to address certain trade frictions, Ambassador Pete Hoekstra told a conference of manufacturers in Ottawa on Wednesday. The talks will resume, he predicted, though he’s not sure when. “I’ve got suggestions that I think can get it restarted, but it’s not going to be easy,” he said. Discussions between the longtime allies have been on ice since Oct. 23, when Trump used his Truth Social platform to express his displeasure over a television ad campaign sponsored by the province of Ontario. The 60-second advertisement used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to make a case against tariffs. “Based on their egregious behaviour, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” wrote Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney said he asked the province not to run the ad, and later said he apologized to Trump. Hoekstra said Wednesday that Canada will have to accept that the days of duty-free trade between the North American neighbours are over. The two countries have enjoyed mostly tariff-free trade since the late 1980s, when Reagan and then-Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney struck a deal, the precursor to a wider North American accord that eventually included Mexico. “There will be a tariff, OK? The president has made it very, very clear,” Hoekstra said, adding that he has encouraged Canadian officials “just to really work closely with us” and “get into the lowest tariff bucket that the United States of America will have.” That might look something like the deal the White House struck with the U.K., the ambassador said. The Trump administration agreed earlier in the year to reduce tariffs on cars, steel and other U.K. products in return for more tariff-free access to the U.K. market.

"Voter frustration over affordability fueled Democratic wins in last week’s state and local elections, and on top of that, Americans are becoming uneasy about the job market too. Some 55% of employed Americans say they’re concerned about losing their jobs, according to a recent Harris Poll conducted for Bloomberg News. That angst follows a drumbeat of layoff announcements by major employers, including Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Starbucks Corp. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. calculated the most job cut announcements for any October in more than two decades. It comes layered on top of households’ exasperation over the cost of living. A 62% majority in the Oct. 23-25 poll said the cost of their everyday items had climbed over the last month and nearly half of those people said the increases have been difficult to afford. President Donald Trump and his aides have responded by putting a positive spin on the economic indicators and deflecting blame elsewhere — tactics President Joe Biden also used, to little avail — along with assuring things will get better. The risk is that, should the job market and prices fail to shift enough to satisfy voters, Republicans risk losing control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections. “The Biden administration really was a cautionary tale about trying to convince voters that the economy is better than their intuitions suggest,” said Tobin Marcus, head of US policy and politics at Wolfe Research and a former adviser to Biden during his vice presidency. Part of the challenge for Trump and his team is their economic program “is not squarely aimed at the pain points that are most important” to voters, Marcus said. The president has championed the steepest tariff hikes since before World War II to shrink the trade deficit and encourage a re-shoring of manufacturing. “They are seeing misplaced priorities,” Marcus said. “No one’s making an argument that the tariffs will bring prices down, which is the thing that voters first and foremost elected him to do.” Back in March, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration would appoint an “affordability” czar, but no such announcement has been made. The White House did not respond to questions about the position, but spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement that “the Trump administration is confident that the disastrous Biden economy will be a relic of the past as we continue to make America affordable again.” Lately, Bessent has taken to playing up how good things will get next year, when he says the impact of Trump’s signature tax-cut legislation will be felt. Billions of dollars worth of tax refunds will be flowing, and job gains will come from the surge of investment in artificial intelligence, he said Tuesday on MSNBC. Trump’s advisers are considering plans for the president to give more speeches around the country about the cost of living, according to a White House official. Trump has done relatively little domestic travel to sell his agenda compared to his recent predecessors. ‘Ominous’ Signs For now, many Americans aren’t buying the administration’s narrative. The Harris Poll showed 48% of respondents said it would take them four months or longer to find a new job of similar quality if they lost their current one. The survey of 2,203 adults had a margin of error of +/- 2.5 percentage points. Job growth has slowed, with payroll gains having plunged from an average of 168,000 a month last year to just 27,000 in May through August — the most recent month for which there’s data. Inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Trump’s tariff policies have both contributed to price pressures and to uncertainty among businesses, undermining incentives to hire. The administration’s sweeping cuts to federal programs also have left thousands of federal workers unemployed and squeezed contractors. “A number of signs, including the most recent consumer sentiment survey, suggest that the economy and the labor market are weakening,” said Michael Reich, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley. “If those trends continue, the party in power will be blamed. That’s ominous for the Republicans in the midterms.” Job Pledges Consumer sentiment fell near the lowest on record in early November, according to a University of Michigan survey. Similarly, an October survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found the share of Americans who expect the joblessness rate to be higher in a year rose for a third straight month. The administration has said the economy will turn in coming months. “We are building auto plants, we’re building AI plants, we’re leading in AI over China and everybody else,” Trump said at a White House event Nov. 6. “When all of these plants start opening, we’re going to have a revolution — a positive revolution — economic revolution like never before.” The return of manufacturing jobs from abroad “is just starting,” Bessent said Tuesday, citing hiring plans at Boeing Co. and a new rare-earth manufacturing site. As for cost of living concerns, the Treasury chief said that “we inherited an affordability crisis,” and climbing working-class wages climb will help address the issue. Trump has been more pointed, lashing out at his party in recent days over lackluster messaging on the economy, which he blamed in part for their string of losses in the election. He’s also pitched some unorthodox ideas, such as $2,000 “dividend” payments to Americans from tariff revenue. The president has also dismissed the idea that living costs are climbing, saying gasoline prices are down. Last Thursday, he claimed “Thanksgiving dinner under Trump is 25% lower than 2024 Thanksgiving dinner under Biden,” citing a Walmart Inc. measure that counted fewer items in 2025. “The Democrats ‘affordability’ issue is DEAD! STOP LYING!!!” he posted on social media.",right
"The state government has constituted a high-level task force, headed by retired IAS officer and former Maharashtra industries secretary Apurva Chandra, to assess the impact of tariff, to ensure that jobs are protected and to recommend how to help industries in Maharashtra from Trump's tariffs. After extensive consultations with stakeholders facilitated by MITRA, the Apurva Chandra Committee is likely to recommend several steps including providing full stamp duty exemption to industries on all export-linked instruments, including term loans, working capital and packing credit for export-oriented units (EOUs). The Chandra Committee is also likely to suggest that exporters to the US could be helped by a state interest subvention scheme of 2%-3% to avail pre and post shipment credit. This would offset some of the tariff impact and high credit costs of MSME exporters. MSMEs involved in textiles from Bhiwandi, Kolhapur, Sangli and Solapur have already alerted the state government that they were losing ground to exports from Bangladesh and Vietnam. Gems and jewellery, textiles and garments have been hit by the US tariffs and there are fears that lakhs of jobs would be lost. The committee is veering towards suggesting that the government introduce a state PF/ ESIC subsidy scheme for the short-term to reduce the wage cost of MSMEs. Under this, the state may reimburse 100% of the employer's PF and ESIC contribution; the stipulation being that it would be applicable to units that do not lay off or do salary deferment for their workers. This would be a much-needed step as without government help at least 5-6 lakh jobs will be under threat by next year. A state government official said: ""Our goal is to give some sops to ensure that these units have some breathing space to manage the tariffs. The tariffs might be temporary but once these units get shut, it would be tough to revive them. So, yes, this would mean forgoing some revenue, but in the long run, once these industries are shut it would be tough to revive them and the state would lose. Hence, giving them more incentives to offset the losses due to tariffs might cost the state in the short run but would benefit it in the long run. We are looking to encourage the affected MSMEs to look at other markets besides the US."" The committee is also looking at how the state could initiate ease of doing business and reduce cost of production for export-oriented units. For instance, it is looking into whether the state could give Open Access of up to 100 KW from the current 5 MW cap for export-linked units to directly source renewable power from developers. This move, if approved, would help export-oriented units as they are currently paying Rs 10-11 per unit which is 30% higher than in states like Gujarat or Karnataka. The switch to renewable power would bring down costs by 20%-25% for these EOUs. Another suggestion to bring down power cost is to allow group captive and third-party models for MSME exporters in clusters and offering 25-30% capital subsidy for solar and wind installations in SEZs, EOUs and industrial parks. Several MSMEs said interest subsidies under the Packaged Scheme of Incentives (PSI) are being computed on notional, not actual interest. MSMEs have been paying back loans at 11%-13% interest rates. Since the state government's subsidy scheme is based on the notional rate of 9%-10%, it leads to MSMEs getting a reduced benefit by up to 30%-40%. Companies have told the Chandra Committee that under PSI, eligible industrial units are entitled to electricity duty exemption as a separate incentive and this should not be counted as part of the PSI incentive. This alone would increase the value of incentive to industries from 5% to 10%. (Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

"'Surprise' job numbers will likely affect Bank of Canada interest rate decision, economists say Statistics Canada employment data show some resilience in Canada’s labour market, 'not strength,' economist says Canada’s unemployment rate fell to 6.9 per cent in October, down 0.2 percentage points from the month before, as the economy added 67,000 jobs — mostly concentrated in part-time work. Statistics Canada said Friday that gains were driven by job creation in wholesale and retail trade, transportation and warehousing, information, culture and recreation, and utilities. Youth unemployment (among those aged 15 to 24) also declined for the first time since February, falling 0.6 percentage points to 14.1 per cent. Here’s what economists are saying about the latest employment data and what it means for the Bank of Canada’s future interest rate decisions. ‘Surprise boost’: Capital Economics The rise in employment in October was “far stronger than we or the consensus had expected and follows a similarly strong September that also far exceeded consensus expectations,” Alexandra Brown, North America economist at Capital Economics Ltd., said in a note. Brown noted the gains were “entirely driven by the private sector” and industries “most exposed to trade,” including wholesale and retail trade, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing. “This provides some reassurance that activity in those sectors is beginning to bounce back, presumably in part because the average tariff rate on Canada’s exports to the U.S. is still relatively low at about five per cent,” she said. Brown also said the job gains in information, culture and recreation may be linked to “both the unseasonably warm weather and Blue Jays’ run toward the World Series.” Hours worked edged down 0.2 per cent in October, which Brown said “largely reflected labour disputes” including the teachers’ strike in Alberta. While employment growth was driven by part-time work, Brown said “we would not make too much of it” because it reversed an “unusually large” gain of 106,000 full-time positions in September. “The surprise boost to employment and fall in the unemployment rate in October reinforces the Bank of Canada’s view that it should now sit on the sidelines and await more clarity on the impact of tariffs on the economy and inflation,” said Brown. - Canada's unemployment rate drops to 6.9% - Bank of Canada should keep cutting interest rates despite job gains - Advertisement 1Story continues below Resilience, but not strength: TD Economics While “solid back-to-back job growth” over the past two months is proving Canada’s labour market is more “resilient to trade tensions” than expected, October’s data is “not a home run,” Leslie Preston, managing director and senior economist at TD Economics, said in a note. Preston said even though labour force growth has “slowed sharply” this year, it is still outpacing job creation; she noted the unemployment rate is still higher from the 6.6 per cent level recorded in January. “Zooming out, we see that the labour market has still softened through 2025 along a number of dimensions,” said Preston. “Even with tighter immigration policy reducing labour force gains, the unemployment rate has risen, and wage pressures have cooled relative to a year ago.” Preston said the latest data will make the Bank of Canada “more comfortable to sit on the sidelines” and let the rate cuts from its latest easing cycle “work their way through the economy.” “The Bank expects reduced inflation pressures from a weak domestic economy to weigh against inflation pressures from U.S. tariffs and restructuring global supply chains,” said Preston. While gains in September and October offset losses in July and August, Preston said “overall job market conditions remain soft.” “While this report shows some resilience in Canada’s labour market, it is not strength,” she said. ‘Volatile survey’: Scotiabank Economics “Canada heaped on jobs of fairly low quality, drove the unemployment rate down and recorded supercharged wage growth and a temporary drop in hours worked,” Derek Holt, vice-president and head of capital markets economics at Bank of Nova Scotia, said in a note. Holt said those factors “vindicate” the Bank of Canada’s “clear hold signal” on its easing cycle and Prime Minister Mark Carney’s administration’s “resistance against heaping on cyclical stimulus” — at least for now. “While it’s a spin of the wheel for a volatile survey, we can’t dismiss two months of strong gains with any greater statistical confidence than we could dismiss the brief summertime soft path as mere statistical noise,” said Holt. He said it was “not a great quality signal” that an 85,000 increase in part-time jobs drove overall gains while the number of full-time positions dropped by 19,000. He also noted that the industries driving job gains tend not to have “relatively high paying jobs” and rely more on part-time workers compared with other sectors. Wage growth “super-accelerated” 9.6 per cent month-over-month on a seasonally adjusted and annualized basis, which Holt noted was the “strongest gain” since June 2022. “Continue to expect strong … wage growth as the one-third of Canada’s workforce that is governed by expiring collective bargaining agreements continues to reset wage growth higher to make up for what they negotiated about four years ago on average. Wage settlements data is unfortunately lagging again to July,” said Holt. • Email: jswitzer@postmedia.com Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Newsom Rebukes Absent Trump at UN Climate Talks in Brazil California Governor Gavin Newsom swept into the COP30 climate summit in Brazil with all the fanfare of a head of state. (Bloomberg) — California Governor Gavin Newsom swept into the COP30 climate summit in Brazil with all the fanfare of a head of state. He met with foreign ministers, huddled with the governor of the state of Pará, Brazil, and signed a declaration for deepened collaboration with Germany’s Baden-Württemberg. And everywhere Newsom went inside the packed conference venue near the mouth of the Amazon River, he was mobbed by delegates and activists eager for a glimpse of the Democratic governor who’s effectively become the highest-ranking US emissary at the international climate talks. “The United States of America is as dumb as we want to be on this topic, but the state of California is not,” Newsom told delegates. “And so we are going to assert ourselves, and we are going to lean in, and we are going to compete in this space.” Newsom and other state and local officials came to the climate summit with a message of continued US commitment to battling climate change, even as President Donald Trump retreats from the fight. Trump, who has derided climate change as a “hoax,” is shunning the United Nations talks and so far hasn’t dispatched even low-level US government officials to the negotiations. Trump is instead “directly engaging” with world leaders on energy issues, a White House official said. That includes using trade talks and tariff threats to encourage other countries to jettison their renewable power commitments and buy more American fuels. And last month, US officials joined Saudi Arabia, Iran and other nations in a successful campaign to derail plans for the first-ever fixed global carbon tax on shipping. On Tuesday, Newsom, who is considering a bid for the presidency in 2028, cast himself as an antidote to Trump. Newsom emphasized that his state of California and its $4 trillion economy, the fourth largest in the world, is leading the fight against climate change and embracing emissions-free electricity. “California distinguishes itself from the current occupant of the White House in Washington, DC,” Newsom said during an event hosted by Germany. “California is a stable and reliable partner.” Newsom also used his time at the Brazil conference to position himself as an international leader and to remind delegates Trump “is not a permanent fixture” in the White House. “Trump is temporary, and I hope folks around the globe remember that,” Newsom told reporters. “He will be remembered in years, not in decades. And he’s reckless, he’s chaotic, mercurial and he’s transactional, but people have to stand up. You stand up to a bully.” Newsom issued a scathing criticism of Trump administration moves he portrayed as running roughshod on state rights and international norms, including strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats. He also denounced tariffs on goods from Brazil. In multiple events, Newsom warned about China’s growing dominance as a supplier of electric vehicles and other clean energy technology. Although China’s President Xi Jinping didn’t attend COP30 events, he sent scores of delegates and mounted a splashy pavilion at the conference. The US and legacy automakers “better wake up to that,” Newsom said at the press conference. “This is about economic power.” One of the great abdications of the climate fight is “the own goal of the president of the United States who simply doesn’t understand how enthusiastic President Xi is that the Trump administration is nowhere at COP30,” Newsom said. In recent weeks, Newsom has moderated his approach on a host of issues, including energy, in what political analysts see as the governor preparing himself for a presidential run. After leading a long crusade against fossil fuels, he’s worked closely this year with the oil industry on changes that may ease regulatory restrictions and boost profits. Newsom’s potential political ambitions — and his lively Trump-trolling social media posts — were an unavoidable backdrop for his visits with foreign leaders in Brazil. “We will be supportive from the federal level,” German State Secretary in the Environment Ministry Jochen Flasbarth said to Newsom at an event Tuesday. “And we are looking forward that there will be a federal administration in Washington, DC, again doing the same as we do.” Minutes later, Newsom was walking to another meeting amid a phalanx of reporters and UN security guards who had linked hands to create a human fence around the politician. An activist shouted, “I love your social media.” Mid-stride, Newsom turned in her direction, beamed and pumped his hands in the air. (Updates with additional comments from Newsom from 11th paragraph.

"President Donald Trump announced Friday that he was scrapping U.S. tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and a broad swath of other commodities — a dramatic move that comes amid mounting pressure on his administration to better combat high consumer prices. Trump has built his second term around imposing steep levies on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of encouraging domestic production and lifting the U.S. economy. His abrupt retreat from his signature tariff policy on so many staples key to the American diet is significant, and it comes after voters in off-year elections this month cited economic concerns as their top issue, resulting in big wins for Democrats in Virginia, New Jersey and other key races around the country. “We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods like coffee,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he flew to Florida hours after the tariff announcement was made. Pressed on his tariffs helping to increase consumer prices, Trump acknowledged, “I say they may, in some cases” have that effect. “But to a large extent they’ve been borne by other countries,” the president added. Meanwhile, inflation — despite Trump’s pronouncements that it has vanished since he took office in January — remains elevated, further increasing pressure on U.S. consumers. The Trump administration has insisted that its tariffs had helped fill government coffers and weren’t a major factor in higher prices at grocery stores around the country. But Democrats were quick to paint Friday’s move as an acknowledgement that Trump’s policies were hurting American pocketbooks. “President Trump is finally admitting what we always knew: his tariffs are raising prices for the American people,” Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer said in a statement. “After getting drubbed in recent elections because of voters’ fury that Trump has broken his promises to fix inflation, the White House is trying to cast this tariff retreat as a ‘pivot to affordability.'” Grocery bill worries Trump slapped tariffs on most countries around the globe in April. He and his administration still say that tariffs don’t increase consumer prices, despite economic evidence to the contrary. Record-high beef prices have been a particular concern, and Trump had said he intended to take action to try and lower them. Trump’s tariffs on Brazil, a major beef exporter, had been a factor. Trump signed an executive order that also removes tariffs on tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes and certain fertilizers. Some of the products covered aren’t produced in the United States, meaning that tariffs meant to spur domestic production had little effect. But reducing the tariffs will still likely mean lower prices for U.S. consumers. The Food Industry Association, which represents retailers, producers and a variety of related industry firms and services, applauded Trump’s move to provide “swift tariff relief,” noting that import U.S. taxes “are an important factor” in a “complex mix” of supply chain issues. “President Trump’s proclamation to reduce tariffs on a substantial volume of food imports is a critical step ensuring continued adequate supply at prices consumers can afford,” the association said in a statement. In explaining the tariff reductions, the White House said Friday that some of the original levies Trump relished imposing on nearly every country on earth months ago were actually no longer necessary given the trade agreements he’d since hammered out with key U.S. trading partners. Indeed, Friday’s announcement follows the Trump administration having reached framework agreements with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina meant to increase the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, while also potentially easing tariffs on agricultural products produced there. During an interview that aired earlier in the week with Laura Ingraham of Fox News Channel, Trump hinted that lower tariffs might be coming. “Coffee, we’re going to lower some tariffs,” the president said then. “We’re going to have some coffee come in.” Tariff checks? Despite pulling back on so many tariffs, Trump used his comments aboard Air Force One on Friday night to repeat his past assertions that his administration would use revenue the federal government has collected from import levies to fund $2,000 checks for many Americans. The president suggested such checks could be issued in 2026, but was vague on timing, saying only, “Sometime during the year.” Trump, however, also said federal tariff revenue might be used to pay down national debt — raising questions about how much federal funding would be needed to do both. Trump rejected suggestions that attempting direct payments to Americans could exacerbate inflation concerns — even as he suggested that similar checks offered during the coronavirus pandemic, and by previous administrations to stimulate the economy, had that very effect. “This is money earned as opposed to money that was made up,” Trump said. “Everybody but the rich will get this. That’s not made up. That’s real money. That comes from other countries.” __ Associated Press writer Chris Megerian on Air Force One contributed to this report.",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format The dominant cryptocurrency fell below $93,714 on Sunday, pushing the price beneath the closing level reached at the end of last year, when financial markets were rallying following President Donald Trump’s election victory. Bitcoin soared to a record $126,251 on Oct. 6, only to begin tumbling four days later after unexpected comments on tariffs by Trump sent markets into a tailspin worldwide. The token pared losses to trade at $94,869 as of 8:39 a.m. on Monday in Singapore. Over the past month, many of the biggest buyers — from exchange-traded fund allocators to corporate treasuries — have quietly stepped back, depriving the market of the flow-driven support that helped propel the token to records earlier this year. At the same time, the recent cooling of high-flying technology stocks has led to a drop in overall risk appetite. For much of the year, institutions were the backbone of Bitcoin’s legitimacy and its price. ETFs as a cohort took in more than $25 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, pushing assets as high as roughly $169 billion. Their steady allocation flows helped reframe the asset as a portfolio diversifier — a hedge against inflation, monetary debasement and political disarray. But that narrative — always tenuous — is fraying afresh, leaving the market exposed to something quieter but no less destabilizing: disengagement. “The selloff is a confluence of profit-taking by LTHs, institutional outflows, macro uncertainty, and leveraged longs getting wiped out,” said Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen. “What is clear is that the market has temporarily chosen a downward direction after a long period of consolidation/ranging.” One of the starkest examples of a buying strike in the digital-asset community comes from Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc., the software firm turned Bitcoin hoarder. Once the poster child for corporate treasury crypto plays, its stock is now flirting near parity to its Bitcoin stash — a sign that investors are no longer willing to pay a premium for Saylor’s high-conviction leverage model. Boom and bust cycles have been a constant since Bitcoin burst into the mainstream consciousness with a more than 13,000% surge in 2017, only to be followed by a plunge of almost 75% the following year. “The sentiment in crypto retail is pretty negative,” said Hougan, who sees the current pullback as a buying opportunity. “They don’t want to live through another 50% pullback. People are front-running that by stepping out of the market.” Bitcoin, which accounts for almost 60% of crypto’s roughly $3.2 trillion in market value, has whipsawed investors throughout the year, dropping to as low as $74,400 in April as Trump unveiled his tariffs, before rebounding to record highs ahead of the latest retreat. One recent hit came in the form of a surprise tariff announcement by Trump that triggered record liquidations on Oct. 10. Bitcoin and the wider crypto market has struggled to recover since. The damage done to traders’ psyche in that selloff “is still holding the big players back and it will take time and a consistent push higher for many to forgive and forget,” said Chris Weston, head of research for Pepperstone Group. The market downturn has been even tougher on smaller, less liquid tokens that traders often gravitate toward because of their higher volatility and typical outperformance during rallies. A MarketVector index tracking the bottom half of the largest 100 digital assets is down around 60% this year. “The markets are always an ebb and flow, and cyclicality in crypto is nothing new,” said Chris Newhouse, director of research at Ergonia, a firm specializing in decentralized finance. But “amongst friends, Telegram chats, and at conferences, the general sentiment I’ve received shows skepticism around capital deployment, and no natural bullish catalysts.” (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

"""We're going to issue a dividend to our middle income people and lower income people - about $2,000 - and we're going to use the remaining tariffs to lower our debt,"" Trump said during the swearing-in of his new envoy to India, Sergio Gor. Kevin Hassett, Trump's top economic adviser, told reporters at the White House on Monday the administration had initially thought it needed to use the tariff revenues solely for deficit reduction, but now saw a chance to move forward with a dividend payment due to what he called ""a big surge in tax revenues."" Trump's poll numbers have weakened in recent months amid growing concerns about the economy and ongoing frustration about inflation, with many voters citing affordability as part of their decision to vote Democrats into office in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. Trump also took issue with media reports about the amount of duties collected that the U.S. government might have to repay if the Supreme Court agrees with a lower court that Trump's sweeping tariffs were illegal. During last week's oral arguments on the tariff case, Supreme Court justices cast doubt on Trump's authority to impose tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which contains no references to tariffs. Justice Amy Coney Barrett suggested it ""could be a mess"" for the courts to administer refunds to U.S. importers who have paid tariffs that were declared illegal. It remains unclear exactly when the highest court will rule, and whether companies will be entitled to refunds of more than $100 billion in IEEPA tariffs paid so far if Trump loses. Trump insisted in a social media post on Monday that those estimates were far too low, and required repayments would exceed $2 trillion in tariff revenues and investments. ""They're not giving the right numbers,"" Trump told reporters. ""There would be an economic disaster. It would be a national security disaster if we lost the case in the Supreme Court."" Trump hailed what he called a decline in inflation since he took office, arguing that food prices and energy prices were coming down and inflation would be down to 1.5% ""pretty soon."" U.S. consumer prices increased slightly less than expected in September from the previous month, as a surge in the cost of gasoline was partially offset by a sharp moderation in rents; a slowdown in price increases for airfares, hotel and motel rooms; and cheaper used cars and trucks. Tariffs on imports continued to raise prices for apparel, appliances, furniture and bedding, and sporting goods. In the 12 months through September, the Consumer Price Index increased 3.0% after advancing 2.9% in August. (Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

"The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard arguments about the legality of President Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs on imports from virtually every trading partner around the world. The case has the potential to force the Trump administration to rethink its approach to trade and tariffs, as several conservative justices joined their liberal colleagues in questioning President Trump’s authority to impose tariffs. At issue is whether Mr. Trump properly invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, a law that gives presidents broad authority during national emergencies, to levy tariffs he says are necessary to address trade deficits, pressure other countries to help the U.S. combat fentanyl smuggling, and protect American manufacturing. The case has enormous implications for American businesses and consumers, as well as for Mr. Trump’s economic agenda. The president has made tariffs a centerpiece of his trade policy, using them to pressure foreign governments and bring manufacturing back to the United States. During nearly three hours of oral arguments, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — all members of the court’s conservative majority — posed skeptical questions to D. John Sauer, the Solicitor General arguing on behalf of the administration. Chief Justice Roberts said the case appeared to implicate the “major questions doctrine,” a legal principle requiring Congress to speak clearly when delegating significant economic authority to the executive branch. If that doctrine applies, it would likely be fatal to the tariffs because IEEPA does not specify that the president may impose tariffs to deal with an emergency. “The vehicle is the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been a core power of Congress,” Chief Justice Roberts said, questioning why the emergency law should be read to grant such sweeping authority when it never explicitly mentions tariffs. Justice Barrett pressed Sauer on why tariffs had to apply so broadly. “I mean, these are kind of across the board,” she said. “Spain? France? I mean, I could see it with some countries but explain to me why so many needed to be subject to the reciprocal tariff policy.” Justice Gorsuch warned of “a one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people’s elected representatives” in Congress, suggesting that accepting the administration’s interpretation could cross a constitutional line. The Central Legal Question: Does the Power To ‘Regulate’ Include Authority to Tariff? The case turns on whether the word “regulate” in the 1977 emergency law encompasses the power to impose tariffs. The statute authorizes the president to “regulate” the “importation” of foreign property during a national emergency but does not explicitly mention tariffs, taxes, or duties. Sauer said the statute’s reference to regulating imports implicitly included tariffs, arguing that any revenue they generate is merely “incidental” to their regulatory purpose. He repeatedly emphasized that the U.S. has traditionally used tariffs to regulate imports. He also argued that Congress should be given more leeway to delegate power to the president when it comes to foreign trade. But Neal K. Katyal, representing small businesses challenging the tariffs, countered that tariffs are taxes, and that the Constitution gives the taxing power exclusively to Congress. When Congress has intended to delegate tariff authority, he said, it has done so explicitly and with clear limits. “It’s simply implausible that Congress handed the president the power to overhaul the entire tariff system and the American economy,” Katyal said. Katyal insisted that while Congress did not mean to include tariffs when it gave the president power to regulate imports in an emergency. He added that Congress could delegate some authority to impose tariffs—as it has under other statutes—it must do so under strict guidance that includes “intelligible principles” and limitations, echoing language that the Supreme Court has used when discussing a frequently mentioned but typically dormant legal doctrine known as “nondelegation.” The liberal justices appeared uniformly skeptical of the government’s position. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the power to tax “is a congressional power, not a presidential power.” Justice Elena Kagan emphasized that both the taxing and commerce powers belong to Congress under the Constitution. Emergency Declaration and Trade Deficits President Trump invoked the emergency law in April to impose a baseline 10 percent tariff on imports from every country, with higher rates on dozens of nations. He declared that “large and persistent” trade deficits constitute “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.” The justices did not directly question whether trade deficits constitute an emergency. Instead, they focused narrowly on whether the statute itself authorizes tariffs as a tool to address such an emergency. Trump first used the emergency law in February to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, saying they had failed to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants into the United States, before expanding the tariffs globally in April. The administration has warned that a loss at the Supreme Court could force it to unwind trade deals and refund billions of dollars in collected tariffs — a scenario Sauer said could trigger economic catastrophe. Katyal told the justices the court has many options for structuring relief, including limiting its decision “to prospective relief” — striking down the tariffs going forward but not requiring refunds for duties already paid. If the court rules against the administration, President Trump would still have other legal tools for tariffs, though with tighter constraints. The administration has already used Section 232 of a 1962 trade law, which allows tariffs on national security grounds after an investigation, to tax roughly a third of U.S. imports including cars, lumber, and metals. The case reached the Supreme Court after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7–4 in August that the emergency law did not authorize tariffs of such magnitude. That court declined to decide whether more limited tariffs might be permissible under the statute. Broader Political Context The case has produced unusual political alignments. Of 44 friend-of-the-court briefs filed, 37 supported the challengers, including submissions from conservative and libertarian groups such as the Cato Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as a bipartisan group of former officials. The challengers include a dozen states and small businesses such as VOS Selections, a wine importer, and Learning Resources, an educational toy company. Hundreds of other firms have joined filings saying the tariffs forced them to raise prices and cut staff. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attended Wednesday’s arguments, underscoring the administration’s view of the case as pivotal. President Trump had initially said he might attend before deciding against it to avoid becoming “a distraction.” The court is expected to issue a decision within weeks or months. Based on the justices’ questioning, several appeared inclined to rein in the administration’s expansive reading of emergency powers, though the outcome may hinge on whether the Court applies the major questions doctrine to foreign-affairs authority — and on how Justices Barrett, Gorsuch, and Brett M. Kavanaugh ultimately align. COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Days before President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, he acknowledged the high prices Americans were seeing at the gas pump and grocery store, pledging to bring them down. “It’s always hard to bring down prices when somebody else has screwed something up like [President Joe Biden] did,” Trump said in a news conference in early January. “We’re going to have prices down. I think you’re going to see some pretty drastic price reductions.” According to exit polls from the November 2024 election, Americans resonated with Trump’s messaging around prices. Exit polls indicated a higher proportion of voters without college degrees and those making less than $100,000 per year cast their ballot for Trump, cementing a rightward shift for the working class that has been trending in that direction for about a decade. But those patterns are shifting once more as emerging economic data shows that the K-shaped economy, coined on Twitter during the pandemic as a half-joking response to debates about whether the recovery would be “U” or “V” shaped, is real. One year into Trump 2.0, the notion is becoming reality of diverging fortunes for wealthy and poor Americans. It has tanked confidence in the economy—and the president who promised to solve the affordability crisis in the U.S. While a wave of working-class voters flooded the Republican party ahead of the 2024 presidential election, that same group sent a loud message in the early November off-year elections, electing Democrats in every single race in which they were running. This included moderates Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger in New Jersey and Virginia, respectively, and firebrand democratic socialist mayors in New York and Virginia: Zohran Mamdani, and Katie Wilson. Their common theme: affordability. Economists have made it clear that somethingreal is shifting: The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer. This week, Apollo chief economist Trosten Slok noted wage growth for the lowest-income Americans plummeted to its lowest in about a decade, while wage growth for the highest-income group surpassed all other income levels, citing data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Moody’s Analytics found last month that for the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of households made up nearly 50% of all consumer spending. According to calculations by New York University economics professor Edward Nathan Wolff, the top 20% of America’s wealthiest households own nearly 93% of all stock. Comments from executives in third-quarter earnings made clear that the Fortune 500 see a “bifurcated” economy. Delta seemed almost surprised at how its premium and business travel seats are due to eclipse the main cabin in 2026, a year ahead of schedule. While McDonald’s CEO talked about a “bifurcated consumer base,” with traffic growth strong among higher-income consumers. By and large, fast-food companies boomed in the quarter while higher-priced “slop bowl” chains such as Sweetgreen, Cava and Chipotle have been struggling to arrest a decline in same-store sales as consumers trade down. The housing market, only in recent memory a booming segment of the economy where many locked in huge equity gains at low mortgage rates, has become nearly frozen because of the “lock-in effect.” It’s simply unaffordable to sell your house and buy another one with mortgage rates above 6%. The first-time homebuyer age hit 40 years old in 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors, revealing that only people with some degree of wealth accumulated over many years of adulthood can afford to make purchases in the housing sector. “We’ve probably made housing unaffordable for a whole generation of Americans,” The Amherst Group CEO Sean Dobson said at the ResiDay real-estate conference in New York in November, telling Fortune on the sidelines that people have done what they’ve been told by getting an education and good jobs “and then they didn’t get what they were promised.” Trump’s role in the K-shaped economy Some of these indicators can be traced back to Trump, who himself rode affordability concerns to a 2024 election victory that once seemed implausible. Pantheon Macroeconomics analysts Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen said in a September research note that suppressed income growth was a result of Trump’s tariff policies, which had forced businesses to slash wages in order to preserve margins that took a hit from the import taxes. In the wake of the November elections “Data show wage growth has slowed more in the trade and transportation sector, and to a lower level, than any other major sector since the end of last year. Fears workers would be able to secure larger wage increases in response to the tariffs look highly unlikely to be realized,” the analysts wrote. Peter Loge, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, who served as senior advisor to the FDA commissioner under President Barack Obama, told Fortune that Trump’s economic priorities can be ascertained by whom he surrounds himself with. “President Trump has installed very wealthy people with very senior positions in government, which isn’t a bad thing, but it’s limiting,” Loge told Fortune, naming in particular Elon Musk, who served as head of the Department of Government Efficiency in the administration’s first months. Loge said the installation of these wealthy figures, as well as the courtship of powerful tech CEOs like Larry Ellison and Sam Altman, illustrates priorities to serve these individuals. The president signed a law in July for a roughly $4 trillion package of tax cuts, primarily benefiting companies and wealthy Americans. Those wealthy individuals, in turn, pour their money into the stock market, feeding the top half of the K, Loge noted. These factors are on top of the administration’s controversial decision to halt funding for SNAP benefits during the government shutdown and require millions of low-income Americans to reapply for the benefits in an effort to combat “fraud,” according to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. But to be sure, the K-shaped economy has existed for decades, economists say, and other economic factors have little to do with the president’s policies. The “low-hire, low-fire” labor market of 2025, for example—which has in particular battered lower-income, entry-level workers such as Gen Z—is more a result of businesses becoming more conservative in their hiring and firing practices following a pandemic-era labor shortage and a hiring binge that may have gone too far during the so-called “Great Resignation.” Changing sentiments Lower-income Americans are noting these changes, with consumer sentiment similarly diverging in a K-shape, something Peter Atwater, adjunct professor of economics at William & Mary, who popularized the term “K-shaped economy”, believes is being overlooked in the K-shaped conversation. Last month, the bottom third of income levels felt much less confident about the U.S. economy compared to the top third, according to data from the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers. “What we have today is a small group of individuals who feel intense certainty paired with relentless power control—and on the other, it is a sea of despair,” he told Fortune. “And that’s the piece that never gets talked about.” Atwater’s diagnosis rhymed with a Financial Times column from Robert Armstrong, of Unhedged, who wrote this week that America has always been unequal, but what makes this moment K-shaped is a loss of faith in future earnings among the lower-income cohort. “It could be,” he wrote, “that after five years of going nowhere, households in the bottom half of the wealth and income distributions have started to anticipate a bleaker future and are changing their spending habits accordingly.” Nose-diving confidence in the U.S. economy is reflected in the attitudes of Republicans and independents who voted for Trump. About 30% of Republicans believe Trump has fallen short of their expectations regarding the economy, according to a national NBC News poll this month. Two-thirds of independents blamed Trump for increasing inflation, per an ABC News/Washington Poll poll conducted in October. CNN polling data meanwhile shows Trump’s approval rating has reached its lowest level since he took office the second time. “People want to know that they can afford a medical bill if they get sick, their kids will have a better future than they do, or have a chance of a better future,” Loge told Fortune. “And if voters feel like things aren’t working, they fire their politicians in charge to hire new ones.” “Voters are pretty well saying, ‘We don’t think whatever the Republicans are doing is making stuff less expensive. We need life to be more affordable and less chaotic. It’s pretty unavoidably chaotic. Now we’re going to bring in new people to try a new thing,’” Loge said. Trump has noted the changing political attitudes following the election, floating a raft of proposals aimed at easing consumers’ pain, such as a 50-year mortgage and $2,000 rebate checks coming from tariff revenue. He said in a Fox News interview earlier this month his party has not done enough to assure Americans about the state of the economy. “We learned a lot,” Trump said. “Republicans don’t talk about it. They don’t talk about the word affordability.” UBS Wealth Management’s global chief economist, Paul Donovan, warned that “affordability” may prove to be an enduring, even intractable problem in both economic and political discourse. In his weekly blog, Donovan wrote that the concept is “subtly different” from both “inflation” and from the “cost-of-living crisis.” It’s an anger about the feeling “I can’t afford that,” he added, one that could be tricky to disprove. “People want things (generally ‘better’ things than they currently have) and are upset that they cannot afford those things,” Donovan wrote. “This may make affordability a more enduring problem than in the past.” He added that social media “fuels resentment” about affordability, as it presents “carefully curated, idealized lifestyles” that are just out of reach to anyone with a smartphone. Shifting political tides Loge hesitated to make predictions about what this changing sentiment means for upcoming elections, particularly if Trump’s tariffs are indeed successful, which could result in an outpouring of support for future Republican candidates. However, he suggested legacy or incumbent politicians from both major parties will have challenges getting elected. Atwater believes the desire—and need—for affordability transcends party lines. “We, particularly those on the left and the right and the establishment, woefully underappreciate how purple the bottom is,” he said. “The unified despair, the sheer desperation on both sides of the aisle, and that will continue to lead to an anti-establishment vote,” he said. Atwater suggested that so long as Americans perceive a broadening wealth gap, lower- and middle-income consumers will continue to harbor resentment for the ultra-wealthy that could simmer over. He cited a 2011 study from the New England Complex Systems Institute, which linked social unrest in North Africa and the Middle East during the Arab Spring of 2010 to rising food prices. “This is a crisis of confidence,” Atwater said. “Sadly, those who are in the best position to address it seem at best indifferent, and that does not go unnoticed by those at the bottom.” Nick Lichtenbergcontributed reporting",right
"Costco joins companies suing for refunds if Trump’s tariffs fall Other brands to bring tariff lawsuits include Revlon Consumer Products Corp. and Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing Corp. Costco Wholesale Corp. joined a fast-growing list of businesses suing the Trump administration to ensure eligibility for refunds if the United States Supreme Court strikes down the president’s signature global tariffs policy. The nation’s biggest warehouse club chain is among dozens of companies to file lawsuits in a U.S. trade court since late October challenging President Donald Trump’s use of an economic emergency powers law to impose the levies, according to court records. It’s one of the biggest corporate players to jump into a fight largely driven this year by small businesses and Democratic state officials. The Supreme Court heard arguments on Trump’s tariffs on Nov. 5. The justices put the fight on a fast-tracked schedule but didn’t say when they intend to rule. In the meantime, businesses of all sizes have brought cases pressing similar legal claims with the goal of avoiding uncertainty about their eligibility for refunds if the court rules against Trump. Costco’s lawyers wrote that the complaint, filed on Nov. 28 in the U.S. Court of International Trade, was prompted due to the uncertainly that refunds will be guaranteed for all businesses that have been paying duties if the Supreme Court declares the tariffs unlawful. The lawsuit doesn’t specify how much Trump’s tariffs have cost the company to date. Costco argues that it needs a court intervention immediately because Customs and Border Protection denied its request to extend the schedule for finalizing tariff determinations under Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The company says that could jeopardize its ability to seek full refunds in the future. Costco didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that, “The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump’s lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court’s speedy and proper resolution of this matter.” - Costco to ‘thin down’ on Christmas products as consumers cut back on spending - Key Supreme Court justices question Trump's global tariffs - Advertisement 1Story continues below Skeptical Justices During arguments before the Supreme Court last month, key justices appeared skeptical of Trump’s tariffs, which have generated tens of billions of dollars a month. Lower federal courts ruled against the administration in a handful of lawsuits filed early on, but judges have allowed the government to enforce the tariffs until the Supreme Court issues its decision. Other household names to bring tariff lawsuits in recent weeks include cosmetics giant Revlon Consumer Products Corp. and motorcycle maker Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing Corp. The expansive, fast-changing tariff policies have disrupted the retail sector this year, threatening to raise prices of goods and hamper the purchasing power of U.S. consumers who are already cautious following years of inflation. The impact has been more muted than expected due to exemptions and changes in rates after negotiations, though some items such as electronics and apparel are more expensive compared to a year ago. While retailers have warned that they continue to see higher costs, many big operators have not pursued lawsuits like Costco — making it an outlier. Costco has said it’s working to mitigate tariffs, which primarily affect its non-food items. It has rerouted some products to non-U.S. markets, ordered more inventory early to get ahead of the levies and purchased from fewer suppliers by consolidating buying. When items get too expensive, it’s changing merchandising altogether. “We’re doing everything we can,” chief financial officer Gary Millerchip said in an interview with Bloomberg News earlier this year. “Whether that’s working with the suppliers to find efficiencies to offset the impact of tariffs, or whether it’s sourcing with them often to different countries.” For example, Costco said in May that it kept steady prices of pineapples and bananas imported from Central and South America because they are important items to customers. At the same time, it increased prices of flowers sourced from the region because they are less of a necessity to shoppers. The club chain said its big size and limited assortment — its stores carry a couple thousand items versus over 100,000 for some big-box retailers — give it a leg-up when navigating tariffs. Still, it’s difficult to predict what will happen to prices, company executives said. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"UK Still in Talks With Trump Team Over Steel, Whiskey Levies The UK is still in talks with President Donald Trump’s administration for a deal to address US tariffs on steel and whiskey, according to the British Consul General in Chicago. (Bloomberg) — The UK is still in talks with President Donald Trump’s administration for a deal to address US tariffs on steel and whiskey, according to the British Consul General in Chicago. The US imposed a 25% tariff on British steel and 10% on the spirit — levies that remain in place despite the UK being the first country to reach a trade agreement with Trump. Tariffs are hurting the whiskey industry on both sides of the Atlantic and the UK isn’t dumping the metal on US shores, said Richard Hyde, who represents British interests in the US Midwest region. “We just need to keep pushing, keep pressing to remove tariffs where we can, whether it be on whiskey, whether it be on steel,” Hyde said on Bloomberg Television on Monday. “We want to see tariffs removed wherever we can remove them, and whiskey is absolutely a priority for us.” The US is the biggest market for UK whiskey and tariffs are costing the industry almost £20 million a month in lost exports, the Scotch Whisky Association said. On the US side, the 10% duty could lead to retail sales losses of more than $300 million, according to an analysis by the Distilled Spirits Council. The UK produces a very specific type of steel that the American defense industry needs, Hyde said. The US insists that steel must be “melted and poured” in the UK to be able to take advantage of the tariff exemptions, a requirement which Tata Steel UK, one of the country’s largest producers, can no longer fulfill after closing its last blast furnace last year. The UK still has a lower US tariff on steel than other parts of the world, Hyde said. Steel Quality “We produce a particular quality of steel in a relatively small volume, which is needed in the United States,” he said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Chicago office. “So the argument that we would make is that that steel is needed by you, it’s needed by very specific industries like defense. So we are not a threat.” The US Supreme Court is expected to consider striking down most of the tariffs Trump has imposed since taking office. A ruling against the president on Wednesday would undercut his ability to use tariffs as an all-purpose tool to wring concessions out of trading partners and could mean refunds exceeding $100 billion. As part of its trade deal with the US, the UK agreed to open its market to American agricultural exports such as beef and corn-based ethanol, offering those concessions in exchange for other trade priorities it wanted to advance, said Hyde. In September, the UK and the US signed the Tech Prosperity Deal to deepen collaboration in key technology areas including AI, quantum computing and nuclear energy. Since then, the US has announced a plan to promote the export of American AI. “That’s another area where we’re very keen that the US and UK partner on whatever that AI stack export program looks like, bringing in UK companies into that mix,” said Stephanie Ashmore, the UK’s director of science and technology in the Americas, who was in Chicago for the 2025 Quantum Summit. Paul Dabbar, deputy secretary for the US Department of Commerce, boasted about the trade deal with the UK at the event on Monday. Commenting on potential export controls for quantum technologies, he said: “I think at the end of the day, like a lot of what we see with classical semiconductors, working with allies is very different than working with people who are not our active allies.” Nuclear Energy Hyde will travel to Indiana later this week for an event with Rolls Royce, which is developing small modular nuclear reactors, or SMRs. The Hoosier state is considering how it can use the technology to supply its future energy needs at a time AI is boosting demand. While a number of US states have moratoriums on nuclear because of issues with waste disposal, many are now reconsidering it as a way to keep energy affordable as demand on grids increase, Hyde said. “This is a conversation about affordability and reliability of energy supply when demand is growing through data centers,” he said. “Pretty much every governor I speak to is really, really keen to explore SMRs. Royce is one of the technologies coming forward. There are other companies as well.” —With assistance from Sara Marley, Erin Ailworth, Elizabeth Campbell, Lynn Doan and Isis Almeida.

"AltaLink and Its Customers Reach Negotiated Settlement on Its 2026-2027 General Tariff Application CALGARY, Alberta — AltaLink and the industry groups representing industrial and residential customers have agreed to a negotiated settlement on the company’s 2026-2027 general tariff application (GTA), which will ensure Albertans have a safe and reliable transmission system at a reasonable cost over the two-year term of the agreement. “By working closely with the associations that represent our largest customers, we found a solution that both carefully manages costs while ensuring the system is safe and reliable for Albertans,” said Gary Hart, AltaLink President and Chief Executive Officer. “This is the fourth time AltaLink has reached a settlement agreement with customers on our GTA.” The negotiated agreement covers substantially all of AltaLink’s 2026-2027 GTA, including operating expenses, AltaLink’s capital replacement and upgrades program, and information technology and security costs. Some remaining items will be reviewed in a public hearing with the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC) later this fall, including AltaLink’s Wildfire Mitigation Plan and future insurance premiums related to wildfire. The AUC approved the negotiated settlement for AltaLink’s GTA and its 2023-2024 direct assigned deferral capital account application on September 24, 2025. “We’re proud that our settlement with customers has been approved by the AUC, recognizing the value we provide to Albertans,” said Mr. Hart. “Our commitment to carefully managing costs while providing reliable service is as strong as ever. For the last seven years, AltaLink kept its rates below 2018 levels to help manage costs to its customers. Looking ahead, we will strive to keep future rate increases below inflation.” Today, AltaLink, L.P. announced net and comprehensive income of $80.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $83.7 million for the same quarter in 2024. Our net and comprehensive income for the three ended September 30, 2025, decreased by $2.9 million compared to the same periods in 2024. These changes are primarily due to decreased revenue from a lower approved return on equity of 8.97% in 2025 versus 9.28% in 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, our revenue from operations was $248.2 million, a decrease of $17.9 million compared to the same period in 2024. The change is are primarily due to higher revenue in 2024 related to the recovery of 2023 wildfire restoration costs through AltaLink’s self-insurance reserve account as approved by the AUC on July 31, 2024, and lower equity returns on rate base in 2025 due to a lower approved return on equity of 8.97% in 2025 versus 9.28% in 2024. As a partnership, AltaLink, L.P. reports its net income before income taxes; therefore, its results are not directly comparable with net income reported by corporations that recognize income taxes in their financial statements. AltaLink’s full financial results and management’s discussion and analysis can be found on AltaLink’s website at www.altalink.ca or on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. Headquartered in Calgary, with offices in Edmonton, Red Deer and Lethbridge, AltaLink is Alberta’s largest electricity transmission provider, with more than 13,400 kilometres of transmission lines and more than 310 substations. AltaLink is partnering with its customers to provide innovative solutions to meet the province’s demand for reliable and affordable energy. AltaLink’s third quarter of 2025 results highlight ongoing focus on safety, reliability and customer satisfaction: - We achieved a customer satisfaction average score of 9.64 out of 10 compared to 9.78 for the same quarter in 2024. - In the second quarter of 2025, we reached a negotiated settlement agreement with customer groups for substantially all our 2026-2027 GTA revenue and the entirety of our 2023-2024 direct assigned deferral capital account application. On September 24, 2025, the AUC approved the negotiated settlement. The AUC will issue the reasons for its approval at a later date. The approved negotiated settlement marks AltaLink’s fourth successful negotiated settlement over the past decade, which secures revenue for AltaLink to balance grid resilience and reliability with affordability for customers. Under the agreement, AltaLink reduced its applied-for operating expenses by $4.0 million and sustaining capital expenditures by $67.0 million for the 2026-2027 test period. The agreement does not include, among other items, AltaLink’s Wildfire Mitigation Plan, insurance premiums, and regulatory accounting of certain costs. These items will be heard in an AUC hearing in November 2025, with a decision expected in the first quarter of 2026. - AltaLink held its 11th annual “Let’s Connect” customer event on October 7, 2025. The event featured a utility CEO panel discussing wildfire management strategy and a discussion on electricity policy with the Minister of Affordability and Utilities. - We had zero employee injuries matching our performance for the same quarter in 2024. - Our customer average outage duration increased to eleven minutes compared to two minutes for the same quarter in 2024. Performance was impacted by the severe windstorm near Brooks, Alberta, which contributed approximately eight minutes. - On August 20, 2025, a tornado with wind speeds reaching 150 kilometres per hour and severe hail swept through the Brooks region of Alberta, causing significant damage to transmission infrastructure. The storm impacted three 138-kilovolt wood pole and two 240-kilovolt steel lattice transmission lines and damaged a total of 34 structures resulting in a power outage for approximately 3,000 FortisAlberta customers due to damage sustained by both AltaLink’s transmission system and FortisAlberta’s distribution network. Leveraging mutual aid in collaboration with other Alberta utilities, power was able to be restored to the majority of customers within 24 hours, with all customers restored in 36 hours. As of October 15, 2025, one 240-kilovolt transmission line remains out of service, with repairs scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of 2025. The total cost of repairs is currently forecasted at $8.5 million, which we expect to recover through our self-insurance reserve. - In July 2025, DBRS reaffirmed its ratings on AltaLink including the Issuer, Medium-Term Note (Secured), and Senior Secured Note ratings at “A”, as well as the Commercial Paper rating at R-1 (low), all with stable trends. “A” and “A-” ratings allow us to keep debt financing costs low for our customers. - In July 2025, with the release of our 2024 Sustainability Report, AltaLink continued to demonstrate its commitment to sustainability as it operates the transmission system that supplies millions of Albertans with electricity. - We earned net and comprehensive income of $80.8 million compared to $83.7 million for the same quarter in 2024. Our income decreased mainly due to decreased revenue from a lower approved return on equity of 8.97% in 2025 versus 9.28% in 2024. - We invested $91.3 million in capital assets compared to $86.2 million for the same quarter in 2024 to ensure continued electric transmission system safety and reliability, to replace transmission assets damaged by severe weather, and to connect customers.

"President Donald Trump’s power to bend a compliant Republican Congress to his will has stalled amid a series of political setbacks that threaten to fracture the party heading into next year’s pivotal midterm elections. In the last week, Trump capitulated to fellow Republicans’ demands for the release of the files of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein; saw his $2,000 stimulus check proposal receive a chilly reception on Capitol Hill; and prompted an intra-party debate over midterm campaign priorities with his broader effort to reclaim the affordability mantle. And late Friday, he lost one of his once-most stalwart allies, Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. An instigator of the push to release the Epstein files, Greene announced she would resign from Congress in January as the president and the congresswoman sparred online. That will at least temporarily shrink the Republicans’ already-tiny majority. The Republican Party is increasingly at war with itself, which doesn’t bode well for its effort to prevent another election-day wipeout like it experienced earlier this month in off-year elections in New Jersey, Virginia, Georgia and California. Victory With a Cost Republicans ostensibly won the government shutdown fight, but they did so by blocking an extension of broadly popular tax credits under the Affordable Care Act. Millions of Americans now face spiking health care premiums, and the president’s party is splintered over how to respond. Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who has frequently sparred with Trump over Epstein and other matters, this week shrugged off the president’s efforts to unseat him in his safely Republican Kentucky district. “I’m winning. He’s losing,” Massie said. Even the party’s typically mild-mannered congressional leaders — House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune — are at odds, with Thune more willing to buck Trump. Thune first refused to obey Trump’s repeated demands to end the shutdown by changing Senate rules. The two congressional leaders then sparred over the handling of the Epstein legislation. That quickly morphed into another battle over a provision tucked into legislation that stands to enrich a group of GOP senators. Now, they’re playing pass the buck on Russia sanctions legislation. A diminished Trump and a splintered party hurt prospects for furthering the president’s legislative agenda around a core issue in the upcoming elections: the state of the US economy. Trump has returned from the brink of defeat before, most famously when he left Washington in disgrace in 2021 following his election loss and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, only to return victorious in 2024. Trump has repeatedly signaled his own worries about the party’s messaging ahead of the 2026 elections, where Democrats aim to retake at least the House. That would give the party shared control of the nation’s purse strings as well as subpoena power and a reliable check on Trump. “Affordable should be our word, not theirs,” Trump said on Monday, referring to the Democratic victories in November where they won by focusing on family-budget issues. ‘Affordability’ Messaging Only 15% of voters in a Fox News poll said Trump’s policies were helping the economy, and 76% viewed the economy negatively, with Trump’s approval rating slumping to 41% — a low for the year in that poll. Vice President JD Vance appealed to voters for patience and predicted an economic boom is coming. “As much progress as we’ve made, it’s going to take a little time for Americans to feel that,” he said at a Breitbart News event on Thursday. Trump even backed off some tariffs, notably on agricultural products like bananas and coffee from Brazil, a tacit acknowledgment that his favorite policy tool also can raise consumer costs. Johnson, whose own fortunes are tied to Trump’s, has increasingly struggled to maintain control of his narrow majority. Both he and Trump were run over this week on the Epstein legislation, flip-flopping in the face of certain defeat after fighting the bill for months. Thune also refused Johnson’s pleas to amend the bill to allow the Justice Department to redact information in the files. The Senate agreed to pass the bill by unanimous consent even before receiving it — a sign of just how toxic the Epstein matter has become. Johnson also said he’s “very angry” that Thune had inserted a provision into the bill ending the shutdown that could net a group of Republican senators millions from taxpayers in lawsuits over the seizure of their phone records during the Biden administration. The provision is already being used by Democrats to attack vulnerable Republicans running for reelection, like Senator Susan Collins of Maine. Meanwhile, the party’s legislative agenda has largely stalled since July, thanks in part to the shutdown. But that seven-week break masked deep splits among Republicans that are now surfacing. They do not yet have a consensus on how to deal with spending bills needed to avoid another shutdown at the end of January. They are just now trying to cobble together a Republican health-care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act — something that has eluded the GOP for 15 years. Trump said Friday he wants that done by Jan. 30. Many of the most endangered Republicans want to extend the existing ACA subsidies for at least another year lest they be blamed for soaring premiums for tens of millions of Americans, but Trump has vowed to oppose any such measure. Trump’s faltering clout could be seen when he started touting $2,000 checks to send to Americans, which he claimed would be paid for by tariff revenue. Already, enough Senate Republicans have told Bloomberg they oppose it to kill the measure. “I think it would be crazy to send money to people while we have a deficit,” Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul said this week. Redistricting Backfires Trump’s push to have Republican states gerrymander their congressional districts to lock in a Republican House majority has backfired, as well, with Democrats potentially set to net seats out of the map-drawing war he started. Indiana Republicans ignored Trump’s public threats and declined to redraw their maps; the Texas GOP’s partisan map is at risk in federal court and Trump’s moves have spurred Democratic states like California to redraw their maps. Trump himself has also started to lash out, telling reporters he had yelled himself hoarse to staffers about trade issues. He quipped he would fire Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent if the Federal Reserve didn’t cut interest rates faster. He snapped at reporters for questioning his position on the Epstein files, for asking about his family’s business relationships with Saudi Arabia and about the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi as he met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office. Trump also called for the arrest and potentially the death penalty for a group of Democratic lawmakers who urged the military and intelligence community not to follow illegal orders. That earned him a mild rebuke from Republicans like Thune, who avoided the issue before finally saying he disagreed with Trump’s comments.",right
"President Donald Trump unleashed on Democrats for their ""affordability"" messaging that drove support for left-wing candidates in the 2025 election cycle, calling it a ""fake narrative"" that ""doesn't mean anything to anybody."" ""You just say it. Affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything. The prices were massively high,"" Trump said Tuesday during his administration's monthly Cabinet meeting – the final such meeting for 2025. ""But the word affordability is a con job by the Democrats,"" Trump continued. The Cabinet meeting marked Trump's ninth in his second term, matching the number of all the full Cabinet meetings former President Joe Biden held during his four years in the Oval Office. SURVEY SAYS: ISSUE THAT HELPED TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS IN 2024 HURT THEM NOW Affordability was the top campaign platform for the handful of high-profile elections held last month during the off-year cycle. Democrats emerged from the 2025 election cycle victorious, including socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani notching a win to become the next mayor of New York City, as well as Democrats winning the only two gubernatorial elections this year, which were held in Virginia and New Jersey. In New Jersey, voters reported that the state's notoriously high taxes and the economy were their top issues heading into the polling stations, according to Fox News Voter Poll data last month. In Virginia, half of voters reported that the economy was their top issue, more than double the number who reported healthcare as their top concern, according to Fox polling data. In New York City, affordability was by far voters' top concern in the notoriously expensive Big Apple, according to previous Fox News Voter Poll data. This week, left-wing Democrats and Republicans are in a fierce battle to win a congressional seat in Tennessee where the Democratic nominee, known as the ""AOC of Tennessee,"" is building support among voters in the deep red state. Trump railed during the Cabinet meeting that his administration is lowering prices for citizens after inheriting ""the worst inflation in history"" under the Biden administration, including by making massive deals with foreign industries to create jobs in the U.S. and his tariff policies that aim to bring parity to the U.S.' chronic trade deficit with foreign countries. ""Our prices now for energy, but for gasoline, are really low. Electricity is coming down. And when that comes down, everything comes down. But the word affordability is a Democrat scam. They say it and then they go into the next subject and everyone thinks, ‘Oh, they had lower prices.’ No, they had the worst inflation in the history of our country,"" Trump continued. In Tennessee, Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other high-profile Republicans have made a mad dash to rally support for Trump-backed congressional candidate Matt Van Epps as he faces off against Democratic Tennessee state Rep. Aftyn Behn, who has been compared to socialist politicians, including Mamdani and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The Tennessee race is a special election to fill Republican Rep. Mark Green's seat in the 7th Congressional District following his resignation from Congress in July. Republicans have previously easily won the seat in the deep red state, but recent left-wing wins during November's elections built Democratic momentum to flip the seat blue. Johnson headlined rallies in the state for Van Epps and Trump called into rallies, as well as posted social media messages promoting that Tennessee voters reject the Democrat candidate. ""The whole world is watching Tennessee right now, and they're watching the district,"" Trump said during one call. TRUMP FLIPS DEMS' 'AFFORDABILITY' SCRIPT, TURNING BUZZWORD INTO MAGA MATERIAL AS MAMDANI VISIT LOOMS Polls suggest a close contest between Van Epps and Behn in a race that will again serve as a bellwether ahead of the highly anticipated 2026 midterm races. Behn, similar to her Democrat colleagues in November's elections, has made affordability one of her top campaign platforms. ""Angry about high grocery prices? Worried about health care costs? Feeling burned by tariffs? Then Dec. 2 is your day to shake up Washington,"" she said in her campaign's final ad. ""That struggling to afford groceries, healthcare, and rent is the life we have to accept,"" Behn wrote in a Substack post in November. ""We have the opportunity through this election to tell those in power that we’re done begging for crumbs, we’re done being sold out, and we’ve had it with the cost of living and the chaos."" SETTING THE STAGE: WHAT THE 2025 ELECTIONS SIGNAL FOR NEXT YEAR'S MIDTERM SHOWDOWNS Meanwhile, Democrats such as Ocasio-Cortez and former Vice President Al Gore have backed Behn's campaign, making Tennessee an unlikely epicenter for another campaign showdown that pits a left-wing candidate promoting affordability against a Republican. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP When asked about Democrats' affordability messaging and if Trump's messaging is falling flat with voters considering the Tennessee race, the White House argued Democrats don't have ""have a leg to stand on when it comes to affordability."" ""The idea that Democrats, who spent four years during the Biden presidency creating the worse inflation crisis in a generation, have a leg to stand on when it comes to affordability is beyond laughable. Americans remember how President Trump’s agenda created historic job, wage, and economic growth during his first term, and Americans know that this same agenda is again restoring working-class prosperity in President Trump’s second term,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai told Fox Digital. Fox News Digital's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",right
"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he will impose a steep tariff on New Yorkers moving to his state after voting on Election Day ends. Abbott, a Republican, made the announcement Monday, a day before New Yorkers headed to the polls to choose a new mayor in what has been a closely watched race between Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a socialist, and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. ""After the polls close tomorrow night, I will impose a 100% tariff on anyone moving to Texas from NYC,"" Abbott posted on X. Fox News Digital has reached out to Abbott's office for comment. ANDREW CUOMO WARNS TRUMP WILL 'TAKE OVER' NEW YORK CITY IF MAMDANI WINS The power to impose tariffs falls under the federal government’s authority, not the states. The NYC mayoral race is one of the most anticipated contests this year. President Donald Trump has endorsed Cuomo, who is running as an independent. CUOMO SAYS TRUMP WILL DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD, SLASH NYC FUNDS IF MAMDANI WINS MAYOR’S RACE On Monday, Trump said he would most likely halt federal funds — aside from the minimum required — to New York if Mamdani is elected. ""It can only get worse with a communist at the helm, and I don’t want to send, as president, good money after bad,"" he wrote on Truth Social. ""It is my obligation to run the nation, and it is my strong conviction that New York City will be a complete and total economic and social disaster should Mamdani win.""

"India’s manufacturing sector posted a nine-month low in growth on Monday, attributed largely to downward pressure on demand caused by U.S. tariffs. Monday’s report was a major collapse from solid growth of 8.2 percent in the previous quarter down to 0.4 percent in October, coming in well below economist estimates of 3.1 percent. Manufacturing output was down from 4.8 percent in September to 1.8 percent in October, with comparable drops in mining and energy. The October numbers were particularly disappointing because the Indian government just implemented a reduction in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) that was intended to boost domestic consumption and offset the effect of U.S. tariffs. On the bright side, government income from the new tax system was up slightly over the same period in 2024, which should address criticism that the lower tax rates would deprive the government of tax revenue. The consumption boost from lower taxes appears to have been enough to keep tax revenue steady, but not quite enough to balance the reduced demand for exports under higher tariffs. “India’s final November PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index) confirmed that U.S. tariffs caused the manufacturing expansion to slow. The new export orders PMI fell to a 13-month low,” noted Pranjul Bhandari, the chief India economist for HSBC Bank. “Business confidence, as indicated by expectations for future output, showed a big fall in November, potentially reflecting increasing concerns about the impact of tariffs,” he said. “The boost from the cuts in goods and services tax (GST) may be fading and it might be insufficient to offset the tariff headwind to demand,” Bhandari predicted. Other analysts praised the “resilience” of India’s manufacturing sector and said business confidence was holding fairly steady, especially if next quarter’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is not reduced by too much. Most economists expect India’s GDP to recover early next year and grow by at least seven percent in 2026. Indian Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agarwal said on Friday that India hopes to sign the first part of a bilateral trade agreement with the United States before the end of 2025. He said a “more immediate” framework trade deal to reduce tariffs could be finished before the full bilateral agreement — which could completely eliminate tariffs from both countries, potentially doubling bilateral trade — was finalized. “We are close, we have tried to iron out most of the issues. Now it is only a matter of time when this decision has to be taken, that is, when the two countries have to find the right landing zone to announce it,” Agarwal said.

"On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that President Donald Trump is proposing a tariff dividend check because “he wants the people of America, the American people to appreciate these tariffs, and he knows if he puts money into their pocket and says, look, this was paid for by the tariffs, they’ll better understand how important this is for America.” Host Larry Kudlow asked, “What’s your take on this tariff dividend distribution next year? It’s not spawned a lot of enthusiasm on the Hill. The president continues to mention it. What does Howard Lutnick think?” Lutnick responded, “Well, look, the President wants to make sure the American people understand that the tariffs are there for their benefit, right? That it’s — yes, it’s going to drive down our deficit. Yes, it’s going to make the country stronger. But he wants the people of America, the American people to appreciate these tariffs, and he knows if he puts money into their pocket and says, look, this was paid for by the tariffs, they’ll better understand how important this is for America.

"Thursday on MSNBC’s “The Beat,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) said President Donald Trump will be handed a defeat by the Supreme Court in his tariff case. Host Ari Melber said, “Your views on that hearing and is the White House wrong? Is this a tax? Is it a bad idea at this point?” Markey said, “A revolution began in Massachusetts 250 years ago, and what the colonists were saying was no taxation without representation. We want to have a vote. We want our congressmen, our senators, to have a vote. We don’t want King George deciding what the tea tax is, what the stamp tax is. So that was the revolution, and we are now having a latter-day revolution against Donald Trump’s attempt to illegally usurp power from Congress to tax.” He added, “I was over there in the Supreme Court yesterday. I sat there, the arched eyebrows of some of the Republican nominated justices, they were going so high they were hitting the ceiling there, arched eyebrows. So the skepticism towards the Republicans solicitor general was absolute. No, this is a tariff, which is a tax. Only Congress can impose taxes. Donald Trump does not have the legal right to do so. So he should be ready to get a kick in the behind from the Supreme Court because it’s arriving in the very near future.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Trump gave an update on the timing of the potential payouts on Friday, saying they won’t come in time for the Christmas shopping season. Instead, he said he’s planning to dole them out in 2026 as he grapples with a tough midterm election cycle. What Trump said on $2,000 tariff dividend checks Donald Trump said the checks will not arrive in time for the Christmas shopping season. “It will be next year. The tariffs allow us to give a dividend. We’re going to do a dividend and we’re also going to be reducing debt,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday.ALSO READ: Jamie Dimon's grim warning for US economy: JPMorgan Chase CEO says 'If we don't fix these things...' When asked if Trump would still send out tariff dividend checks if the Supreme Court rolls back his tariffs, Trump said, “Then I’d have to do something else.” Moreover, the tariff rebate would need approval from Congress, where several Republicans have previously expressed skepticism, and instead said Trump should be focusing on slashing the federal budget deficit. Trump administration officials have given few details about how tariff rebate checks would work. Last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent explained that the administration was still figuring out an income limit. “Well, there are a lot of options here that the president’s talking about a $2,000 rebate and those — that would be for families making less than, say, $100,000,” Bessent told “Fox & Friends” last Wednesday. Then he quickly clarified that “it’s in discussion” and “we haven’t” decided on that limit. All about $2,000 tariff dividend checks Trump first floated the idea of tariff dividends earlier this month, suggesting that high-income earners would be excluded, though he did not define a specific income threshold. Trump said his Truth Social platform, “A dividend of at $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone. Those against the tariffs are FOOLS!”ALSO READ: Kenny Easley cause of death: How did Seattle Seahawks legend die? A look at his health struggles after his tragic demise The President caveated that the plan is to exclude “high income people,” without specifying a specific income threshold. If the $2,000 dividend payments were narrowed to individuals earning under $100,000, it would cost about $300 billion, according to an estimate from Erica York, the Tax Foundation’s vice president of federal tax policy. A COVID-19-era proposal to dole out $2,000 checks to families was estimated to cost some $464 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Rebate to families earning less than $100,000 The Trump administration is considering a $2,000 rebate for families earning under $100,000, though the final income limit has not been set.

Kayla Nicole faces massive backlash after her controversial tweets re-surface “Well, there are a lot of options here that the president’s talking about a $2,000 rebate and those — that would be for families making less than, say, $100,000,” Bessent told Fox & Friends, later clarifying that no final decision had been made. The proposal also faces legal and political obstacles. The US Supreme Court has raised questions about whether Trump’s tariffs are valid under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). If the Court rules against them, Trump has said he will “have to do something else.” Any rebate plan would also need approval from Congress, where some Republicans are hesitant and want to prioritise reducing the federal deficit. Trump continues to defend tariffs as a way to rebalance trade and strengthen US businesses. Bessent said the goal is to create a “perfect storm” for trade rebalancing, not just to raise money.

"Listen to this article in summarized format Tariff worries already in the price Chalke noted that recent tariff concerns from the Trump administration have impacted valuations of branded and specialty pharma exporters, but the earnings impact is likely limited.Many branded players, he said, have manufacturing presence in the US, which helps mitigate tariff risks. “We remain positive on companies supplying branded products from India to the US,” he added. Q2 earnings: Hospitals and CDMOs outperform India’s hospital space continued its leadership streak in Q2, reporting 16–17% revenue growth and 17–18% EBITDA growth, outperforming pharma peers that posted revenue growth of 11–12%.Chalke reaffirmed his pecking order: 2. CDMO (Contract Development & Manufacturing) players 3. Generic pharma companies Both hospitals and CDMOs are expected to deliver 20% EBITDA CAGR over the next 2–3 years, he said. China+1: A structural tailwind for Indian CDMOs Dispelling concerns over sustainability of the China+1 opportunity, Chalke said the trend is structural, not cyclical.Indian CDMO firms, he said, are poised for 15–20% revenue CAGR, driven by commercial project ramp-ups. Large CDMOs, he added, will benefit the most—as seen in the Chinese market where bigger players gained disproportionate growth. Hospitals with improving EBITDA per bed will lead Within hospitals, he advised focusing on companies where EBITDA per bed is improving and where the city mix is shifting toward higher-paying markets.He also recommended players trading at discounts to sector leaders. Generics face weak FY27 despite strong near-term numbers While many generic pharma companies posted strong Q2 results, Chalke warned that FY27 could be weak as key high-margin opportunities fade and competition intensifies.“Near-term momentum is strong, but earnings decline is likely after two or three quarters,” he said. India’s global positioning remains strong despite tariffs Despite uncertainty from US tariffs and the BIOSECURE Act, Chalke believes India’s pharma advantage remains intact, backed by strong cost efficiencies and export capability.Generic exports to the US and non-US markets will continue growing, aside from temporary product-specific disruptions like Revlimid, he added. From tablets to biosimilars: India is moving up the value chain Chalke highlighted that Indian pharma has already transitioned from simple oral solids to biosimilars, complex injectables, and inhalers, reducing the threat from low-cost Asian competitors.Post Q2, earnings estimate changes across the sector are minor—within a 0% to 5% range, indicating no major recalibration is needed.

"This development, alongside the inclusion of copper and metallurgical coal, is expected to influence future US tariffs and industrial policies, as well as domestic mining initiatives. The list, updated every three years by the US Geological Survey, helps guide national security-oriented tariffs and federal support for mineral projects. While copper and coal were widely anticipated additions, silver’s inclusion marks a notable shift. The Trump administration had previously expanded the definition of “critical” minerals, emphasising the importance of securing domestic supply chains for key resources. Silver now joins a category that directly affects federal review processes, including those under Section 232 tariff regulations. What it means for investors Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst - Currencies & Commodities at Reliance Securities, noted: “If silver is now being seen as a strategic metal with higher industrial demand, supply constraints and strategic issues may support higher long‐term prices.” Silver’s criticality is reinforced by its wide range of applications in modern technologies such as electronics, solar panels, and electric vehicles (EVs). The US currently imports about two-thirds of its silver, and fears of potential tariffs have led to stockpiling in New York, where inventories reached record highs. This activity has also caused temporary shortages in other regions, such as London. The US has taken some measures to mitigate potential disruption by including certain customs codes for silver in its tariff exemption list. However, the broader implication remains that tighter control over supply chains and incentivised domestic production could limit global availability and affect pricing trends. According to Trivedi, “With the U.S. adding silver to its critical minerals list, global supply may become more constrained, since supply chains will be more secured, domestic mining encouraged in the USA, potential tariff/stockpiling measures.” He added, “That means for India, which is a large silver importer, the cost of import could go up or supply could tighten and domestic silver price could rise further.” Indian investors, who have traditionally engaged with silver for both jewellery and investment purposes, now find themselves in a favourable position. Trivedi remarked, “For Indian investors, it's a positive signal — it adds a structural layer to silver’s appeal beyond typical jewellery/investment.” The domestic context in India also supports a bullish case for silver. “In India, demand for silver is rising due to solar/renewable energy, EVs, electronics, etc. So Indian investors have the double benefit of global tailwinds + domestic demand growth,” said Trivedi. He further noted, “Indian investors gaining exposure could benefit from this structural shift.” The growing industrial utility of silver, combined with evolving geopolitical and economic policies, signals a paradigm shift in how the metal is valued by markets. As global governments increasingly view silver as a resource of strategic importance, its status as a store of value and industrial input appears to be entering a new phase—one that could reshape investment strategies across borders.

"In a village outside Botswana’s capital, Keorapetse Koko sat on an aging couch in her sparsely furnished home, stunned that a career — and an entire nation’s economy — built on diamonds had fallen so far, so fast. For 17 years, she had earned a living cutting and polishing the gems that helped transform Botswana from one of the world’s poorest nations into one of Africa’s success stories. Diamonds were discovered in 1967, a year after independence, an abrupt change of fortune for the landlocked country. Botswana became the world’s top diamond producer by value, and second-largest by volume after Russia. Diamonds are woven into the national identity, with local Olympic champion runner Letsile Tebogo heading a De Beers campaign celebrating how the industry funds schools and stadiums. The stones that Koko and thousands of others dug and polished over the decades have funded Botswana’s health, education, infrastructure and more. The country risked the “resource curse” of building its economy on a single natural asset — and unlike many African nations, it was a success. But Koko lost her job a year ago, joining many others left adrift as Africa’s trade in natural diamonds buckles under growing pressure from cheaper lab-grown diamonds mass-produced mainly in China and India. “I have debts and I don’t know how I am going to pay them,” said the mother of two, who had survived on about $300 a month and relied on her employer for medical insurance. It had been a decent situation for a semi-skilled worker in a country where the average monthly salary is about $500. “Every month they call me asking for money. But where do I get it?” ‘Diamonds built our country’ Botswana, which has unearthed some of the world’s biggest stones, has prided itself on prudently managing its natural wealth, avoiding the corruption and fighting that have plagued many African peers. Its marketing message has been simple: Its stones are conflict-free and help fund development. “Diamonds built our country,” said Joseph Tsimako, president of the Botswana Mine Workers Union, which represents about 10,000 workers in the nation of 2.5 million people. “Now, as the world changes, we must find a way to make sure they don’t destroy the lives of the people who helped build it.” He warned that new U.S. tariffs under the Trump administration could worsen Botswana’s downturn, triggering staffing freezes, unpaid leave and more layoffs. The U.S. has imposed a 15% tariff on diamonds that are mined, cut and polished there. Diamond exports, roughly 80% of Botswana’s foreign earnings and a third of government revenue, have tumbled. Debswana, the largest local diamond producer and a joint venture between the government and mining giant De Beers, saw revenues halve last year. It has paused operations at some mines as Botswana and Angola enter talks to take over controlling stakes in De Beers’ diamond mining unit. In September, Botswana’s national statistics agency reported a 43% drop in diamond output in the second quarter, the steepest fall in the country’s modern mining history. The World Bank expects the economy to shrink 3% this year, the second consecutive contraction. The rise of synthetic diamonds The global rise of synthetic diamonds has been swift. They have “given stiff competition, especially in lower-quality stones,” said Siddarth Gothi, chairman of the Botswana Diamond Manufacturers Association. The gems emerged in the 1950s for industrial use. By the 1970s they had reached jewelry quality. Lab-grown stones now sell for up to 80% less than natural diamonds. Once making up just 1% of global sales in 2015, they have surged to nearly 20%. Glitzy social media videos have fueled the appeal of synthetic gems made in weeks under intense heat and pressure and marketed as cheaper, conflict-free and eco-friendly alternatives to stones formed over billions of years. Environmental groups have said natural diamond mining can drive deforestation, destroy habitats, degrade the soil and pollute the water. But environmental claims about the synthetic gems also face scrutiny, with critics noting that production remains energy-intensive, often powered by fossil fuels. From “a marginal phenomenon,” an “unprecedented flood” of synthetics now threatens the natural diamond’s value and future, World Federation of Diamond Bourses president Yoram Dvash warned in July. Lab-grown stones now account for most new U.S. engagement rings, he said. Natural diamond prices have fallen roughly 30% since 2022, leaving the industry at what Dvash called “a critical juncture.” Hollywood stars, including Billie Eilish and Pamela Anderson, and Bollywood celebrities have boosted synthetic diamonds’ allure, along with Gen Z influencers. “The new generation of youngsters getting engaged, they’ve got far more important things to spend their money on than a diamond,” said Ian Furman, founder of Naturally Diamonds, which sells natural and synthetic diamonds in neighboring South Africa. “So, it’s become so attractive to them to buy lab diamonds.” Furman said that for every 100 diamonds his company sells, around 95 are synthetic when just five or six years ago it was overwhelmingly natural diamonds. African producers feel the pain The shift is felt beyond Botswana. Across southern Africa, falling production of natural diamonds and revenue have led to job cuts and financial strain. To counter the trend, Botswana, Angola, Namibia, South Africa and Congo in June agreed to pool 1% of annual diamond revenues, translating into millions of dollars, into a global marketing push led by the Natural Diamond Council to promote natural stones. The nonprofit’s members include major mining companies such as De Beers Group and Rio Tinto, which have invested heavily in natural diamonds. Last year, the council launched a “Real. Rare. Responsible” campaign starring actor Lily James in a bid to recast natural diamonds as unique and ethically sourced. Kristina Buckley Kayel, the council’s managing director for North America, said restoring natural diamonds’ “desirability” is essential to protect producer economies, particularly in southern Africa. With its diamond income no longer assured, Botswana’s government in September created a sovereign wealth fund focused on investment and diversification beyond mining, although details about its value and investors sketchy. Suddenly, the country’s elephant-heavy tourism industry and other mining options, including gold, silver and uranium, are more important than ever. But for Koko, the laid-off diamond worker, the policy shift may have come too late. “I was the breadwinner in a big family,” she said. “Now I don’t even know how to feed my own. Looking for another job is very difficult. The skills I learned are only relevant to the diamond industry.” She never owned a diamond herself. Even the smallest would be a luxury beyond her means.",right
"China said on Wednesday it would extend a suspension of additional tariffs on US goods for one year, making official an agreement reached in talks between presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump last week. The two leaders held talks in South Korea at the end of October that effectively extended a delicate truce for a year, after several rounds of trade negotiations in recent months. A statement published Wednesday on the Ministry of Finance website, citing Beijing's State Council, said that ""for one year the 24 percent tariff on US goods will continue to be suspended, (and) a 10 percent tariff on US goods will remain"". The statement said the pause follows ""the consensus reached in the China–US economic and trade consultations"" and would be effective from November 10. Trump on Tuesday formalised an agreement that Washington would cut its additional tariffs on Chinese imports from 20 percent to 10 percent, also effective from November 10. Temperatures have spiked between the world's two biggest economies this year as Washington and Beijing imposed escalating tariffs on each other's products. At one point, duties on both sides reached prohibitive triple-digit levels, hampering trade. The two have been engaged in an uneasy truce since, as top economic leaders met several times for talks in recent months, with tensions surging over export controls and other issues. In a separate statement, China said it would ""cease implementing the additional tariff measures"" imposed in a March order hitting a list of American farm products. That move was a response to Trump doubling additional tariffs on Chinese goods over Beijing's handling of fentanyl -- now back to 10 percent starting next week. Beijing had placed an additional 15 percent levy on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton imported from the US and an additional 10 percent tariff on American soybeans, pork, beef, dairy and other farm products. That had hurt a key source of Trump's political support: farmers. More than half of US soybean exports went to China last year, but Beijing halted all orders as the trade dispute deepened. Also following talks, Beijing agreed to suspend for one year restrictions on the export of rare earths technology. Rare earths are a strategic field dominated by China and are essential for manufacturing in defence, automobiles and consumer electronics. Washington in turn agreed to suspend for one year a move imposing ""Entity List"" export restrictions on affiliates of blacklisted foreign companies in which they had at least a 50 percent stake, the Chinese commerce ministry said. The United States also said it would halt for a year measures targeting China's shipbuilding industry that led to both sides applying port fees against each other's ships, it said.

"Listen to this article in summarized format Shares of Legrand plunged after the French data-center equipment firm reported sales growth of 11.9% in the first nine months of the year, slightly below expectations, hit by U.S. tariffs. Sterling strengthened 0.64% to $1.3132. Ahead of likely tax hikes in UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves' budget later this month, the BoE Monetary Policy Committee voted 5-4 to keep the central bank's benchmark bank rate at 4.0%. The close vote kept expectations of a cut before year-end intact. On Wall Street, investors remain focused on stretched valuations, the U.S. government shutdown, trade tariff legal rulings and the ongoing slew of corporate earnings. ""This earnings season is not defined in the rearview mirror. The market wants guidance and right now, with tariffs, the shutdown and possibly peak AI, the future could be bleak,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Earlier this week, some U.S. bank chief executives warned about a likely market pullback. The S&P 500 technology index was down more than 1%. Investors digested a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas that showed U.S.-based employers cut more than 150,000 jobs in October, marking the month's biggest reduction in more than 20 years. Economic data from private sources has drawn increased investor interest amid the absence of official data during the U.S. government's longest-ever shutdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 231.32 points, or 0.49%, to 47,080.37, the S&P 500 fell 45.36 points, or 0.67%, to 6,750.93 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 311.21 points, or 1.32%, to 23,189.74. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 2.62 points, or 0.26%, to 995.27. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.7%. Overnight, Japan's Nikkei rebounded 1.4% after sliding 2.5% on Wednesday. In China, Shanghai's benchmark stock index reclaimed the psychologically important 4,000 level, as optimism over tech self-sufficiency boosted its semiconductor and AI-related shares. The dollar fell after weak U.S. labor data increased market expectations of another Federal Reserve rate cut this year. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, fell 0.41% to 99.72, with the euro up 0.47% at $1.1544. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar weakened 0.65% to 153.11. In bond markets, euro zone benchmark Bund yields dropped from their four-week high after the BoE decision. Germany's 10-year yields were down 2 basis points at 2.65% after hitting 2.676% early in the session, the highest level since October 10. U.S. Treasury yields fell, with investors concerned about the labor market and uncertainty from the U.S. government shutdown. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes dropped 6.6 basis points to 4.091%, from 4.157% late on Wednesday. U.S. crude eased 17 cents to settle at $59.43 a barrel and Brent fell 14 cents to settle at $63.38.

"The Tarifflation Narrative Was Destroyed by a San Francisco Fed Paper For as long as anyone can remember, economists and journalists have issued a consistent warning about tariffs: they will push prices up. It’s been the cornerstone of the case against President Donald Trump’s trade policy. Raise tariffs, and consumers will pay more at the checkout counter. It’s simple economics, they tell us. A new paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco suggests the economic establishment got this one backwards. Economists Régis Barnichon and Aayush Singh examined major tariff changes across the United States, the United Kingdom, and France over 150 years. Their finding: when tariffs rise, inflation actually falls. Higher unemployment also follows, but the consumer price spiral that economists predicted? The data doesn’t support it. This doesn’t mean tariffs are costless. It means the case against them will have to rest on grounds other than “they make things more expensive.” (Photo: iStock/Getty Images; Federal Reserve via Flickr; BNN)Tariffs Actually Push Down Inflation To understand what the paper does establish, it helps to start with the pattern itself. Barnichon and Singh assembled annual data on tariffs and inflation going back to 1870. They tracked what happened to prices and employment in the years following major tariff increases. The results were consistent across time periods and countries. In the pre-World War II data, a permanent four-percentage-point tariff increase is followed by roughly a two-percentage-point decline in inflation and a one-percentage-point rise in unemployment. Post-war estimates move in similar directions but are less precise, in part because this was a period in which tariffs were typically falling rather than rising. The pattern persisted whether you looked at the era of rapid globalization before 1913, the chaos of the 1930s, or the modern period. It held for France and Britain as well as the United States. The authors used two different statistical methods and got the same answer both times. So, the empirical fact is straightforward: over 150 years, tariff increases have correlated with lower inflation and higher unemployment. That’s what the econometrics show. Why Do Tariffs Push Inflation Lower? Here’s where things get more complicated—and where much of the recent commentary on this paper has gone astray. The authors observe that this pattern resembles what happens in a standard economic model when aggregate demand falls. Lower spending by consumers and firms would produce exactly this combination: more joblessness and falling prices. So, Barnichon and Singh suggest that tariffs might work through demand channels, perhaps by creating uncertainty that dampens business investment and consumer confidence. It’s a plausible hypothesis. But it’s important to understand what it is: a hypothesis, not a finding. The paper doesn’t prove that households cut spending because they feel poorer. It doesn’t isolate the demand channel from other possible mechanisms. The authors themselves acknowledge this, writing that understanding the theoretical mechanism behind their findings is “an important avenue for future research.” In other words, they’ve documented a durable pattern. They haven’t explained it. Tariffs Don’t Cause Recessions This distinction matters because recent commentary has taken the paper’s findings further than the evidence supports. Some critics have claimed the study shows that tariffs “shrink the economy” or cause recessions. But the paper doesn’t demonstrate that. Not even close. The rise in unemployment they find is real and worthy of attention, but it’s not a recession. The authors don’t claim their findings show that tariffs trigger economic contractions. Others have suggested the paper proves that demand destruction is the explanation for lower inflation. Again, that’s interpretation. The paper shows a pattern consistent with demand destruction, but it doesn’t prove demand destruction is what’s happening. Credit tightening, shifts in bargaining power between labor and capital, changes in the mix of jobs across sectors—any of these could produce the same correlation. The paper is also silent on long-term effects. It tells you what happens in the near term after a tariff shock. It doesn’t tell you whether the economy ends up richer or poorer years later. Those who say tariffs weaken the economy cannot point to this paper as supporting the view. It says nothing about productivity, wages, manufacturing output, or the overall health of the economy. Those are separate questions entirely. What Actually Gets Disproven What the paper does decisively undermine is the claim that tariffs are inflationary. This has been the intellectual foundation of the anti-tariff consensus for decades. Raise tariffs, and prices rise—a simple cost-push mechanism that sounds plausible in economic theory. The 150-year record suggests otherwise. And the paper comes from inside the Federal Reserve, not from pro-Trump trade economists with a political axe to grind. This is genuinely significant. It means policymakers can no longer rely on the “tariffs raise prices” argument to dismiss trade protection out of hand. That argument has lost its empirical footing. This does not prove that tariffs are always and everywhere the right policy. It just means the case against tariffs has to happen on different terrain. Questions about whether tariffs encourage productive investment, help the U.S. to obtain more favorable terms of trade, boost efforts to rebuild manufacturing capacity, or serve legitimate national purposes can now be debated without the presumption that the main effect will be higher consumer costs. The historical evidence shows tariffs do not cause inflation. That’s a major win for the defenders of Trump’s trade policies.

"Sellers in other countries struggle to maintain US customers as holiday shopping season starts NEW YORK (AP) — At Fleece & Harmony, a woolen mill and yarn shop in bucolic Belfast, Prince Edward Island, in Canada, owner Kim Doherty used to be able to send yarn skeins to U.S. customers across the border with little fanfare. The yarn orders usually met an import tax exemption for packages valued at under $800, meaning it could be imported tariff-free and avoid the customs process. But ever since the Trump administration eliminated the exemption as of Aug. 29, the cost to send yarn to U.S. customers has skyrocketed. The bill for a $21 ball of yarn now includes $12 to $15 in brokerage fees that her shipper UPS charges, plus state taxes and a 6.5% tariff, all of which almost doubles her costs. “We had orders that have reached the customers and they’re in shock about the fact that they have to pay,” she said. “And it’s amazing how many people really didn’t know what the impact was going to be.” Getting rid of the so-called de minimis exemption was meant to curb drug trafficking and stop low-quality goods from discount sellers like Temu and Shein flooding the U.S. market. But as the all-important annual holiday shopping season kicks off, it is putting a crimp on small businesses and shoppers now facing higher costs. Chad Lundquist in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, ordered fragrance oil from a site called Oil Perfumery in October, but he didn’t realize the business was based in Toronto, Canada. His total was $35.75, which included an $8 standard shipping fee. But when his package arrived, he was hit with a $10.80 tariff bill from FedEx. “It wasn’t worth the $10 tariff for a $27 purchase,” Lundquist said. Oil Perfumery did not respond to a request for comment. He’s not the only skittish shopper. Three months after the exemption ended, sellers abroad are reporting drastic declines in U.S. sales. Some are paying the duties themselves instead of passing them to consumers. They are also trying to focus on domestic customers to replace U.S. ones and adjusting product lineups to feature best selling items to try to goose sales. Martha Keith, founder of British stationery brand Martha Brook, which is based in London with a small office in Melbourne, Australia, said U.S. sales from her Etsy store — her main e-commerce channel in addition to her own website — were up 50% for the year before the exemption ended. But sales fell dramatically when the tariffs hit, and continue to drop even though she’s paying the import taxes and customs fees herself so customers aren’t impacted. Sales are down about 30% year-over-year. “The issue seems to be in customer confidence hitting the desire to order from businesses outside of the U.S., because of confusion about how the tariffs will affect them,” Keith said. She’s also in a bind because she sold a £109 ($144) stationery advent calendar to about 344 U.S. customers ahead of the tariffs, and had to ship them under the tariffs. Shipping and tariffs cost her an additional £5750 ($7590) to cover shipping the advent calendars already sold. “The whole thing has been a bit of a nightmare for businesses like ours, and such a huge shame, as the U.S. market was such a valuable growth area for us, particularly through Etsy,” she said. The timing was particularly bad for Sue Bacarro, who along with her sister co-owns Digi Wildflowers, an Etsy shop that sells embroidered baby blankets, gifts and custom quilts for wedding and anniversaries, located across the border from Detroit in Windsor, Ontario. Before the announcement of the removal of the de minimis exemption, they placed a large inventory order to prepare for the holiday season and early 2026 demand. But when the de minimis exemption ended, “inventory wasn’t moving as expected, and we suspected customers were hesitant to purchase due to potential duty charges,” Bacarro said. Sales — 70% of which come from Americans — finally started to rebound when Digi Wildflowers prominently added a banner on its site that said, “U.S. Import Duties On Us.” “Heading into this holiday season, we’re keeping that message front and center through banners, social media, and direct communication,” said Bacarro, who is also expanding their product line. But not all businesses can — or want to — pick up the tariff tab. Kim Doherty, who runs the woolen mill on Prince Edward Island, doesn’t plan to pay the tariff and fees for her customers. “I’m not in a position as a small business owner to do that. The profit margins are already rather thin,” said Doherty, adding that “on principle,” she shouldn’t have to do it. Right now, her shipments to U.S. customers are about 10% of what they were. Instead, she’s working on expanding her fiber offerings to Canadian customers at her brick-and-mortar store and fiber festivals. “We’ll see what happens,” she said. “I’m pretty sure that my U.S. customers were shopping and not even thinking about it, but now they’ll be evaluating the purchases that they’re making, knowing that they are going to have the extra fees on top of whatever they see.” Some Etsy businesses have been stymied by international postal services temporarily halting deliveries to the U.S. because of the confusion around the ending of de minimis. Selene Pierangelini’s business, Apricot Rain Creations, based in Brisbane, Australia, which sells crystals, candles, and spiritual wellness products on Etsy, depended on the Australia Post to get deliveries to U.S. customers. More than three-fourths of her customer base comes from the U.S. Australia Post suspended service to the U.S. for about a month, resuming on Sept. 22. She temporarily switched to FedEx and UPS — private shippers that are more expensive than Australia Post. Since it resumed, Australia Post is working with Zonos, a provider of cross-border shipping technology, to offer a shipping calculator that lets her prepay duties and fees. They themselves charge a fee of $1.69 plus 10% of the total duty fee. So far, the items she ships from Australia have been tariffed at a 10% rate, the baseline tariff for the country. She increased her shipping costs to help cover the expense. It is manageable, but tricky, she said. “You don’t really know how much (the cost) is going to be until the package clears custom in the U.S., and you get an invoice which is automatically paid out of your account,” she said. And her sales have not recovered. Before the tariffs, her U.S. sales were about 85% of her total sales, and now they’re around 35%. She’s hopeful people are just holding off until Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday sales. In the meantime, she has restarted sales to Europe, which she had paused in 2024 due to increased regulations. And she’s launched a Facebook marketing campaign and is exploring print-on-demand services from U.S.-based providers for production and fulfillment. “This situation highlights how fragile small businesses can be when dependent on one market,” Pierangelini said. “While it has been a shock, it’s also pushed me to diversify — something that will hopefully make my business stronger and more resilient in the long run.” Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Carney cranks up steel import restrictions, relief on inter-Canada shipping rates The PM has said Canada is one of the countries 'most exposed to the fundamental restructuring of the global steel industry' New restrictions on foreign steel imports and policies designed to make it cheaper to ship steel to Western Canada are being implemented by the federal government, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced on Wednesday. Canadian steel producers are trying to increase sales within the country to offset declining sales in the United States, where 50 per cent tariffs remain in place and increasingly make their products less competitive. Carney’s announcements are part of a package of support for the steel industry as well as the lumber sector, which have been among the hardest hit by the U.S.-Canada trade war. “The Canadian steel and lumber sectors will always be at the heart of Canada’s competitiveness, our security and our strength,” Carney said. “These are sectors that reflect our nations character, resilient and forward looking with a history of reinventing themselves at pivotal moments.” Carney was flanked by several cabinet ministers as well as Ron Bedard, chief executive of ArcelorMittal Dofasco, who he thanked “for helping us design some of these support measures.” One new federal policy restricts steel imports from companies in countries that lack a free-trade agreement with Canada to 20 per cent of the volume they shipped here in 2024. Above that threshold, a 50 per cent tariff kicks in. Similarly, it restricts companies in countries that have free-trade agreements with Canada — not including the U.S. and Mexico — to 75 per cent of their 2024 shipments here, above which the 50 per cent tariff kicks in. The moves tighten existing federal policies announced in July that allowed non-free trade countries to ship 50 per cent of their 2024 volume to Canada before the 50 per cent duty rate kicked in, while free-trade countries were allowed to ship 100 per cent of what they sent in 2024 before the higher duty rate applied. A separate policy creates a 25 per cent tariff on “steel-derivative products” — essentially one step up from raw steel — such as wind towers, prefabricated buildings, fasteners and wires. Some in the industry had complained that the original quotas were too narrowly tailored to apply to raw materials and that overseas steel producers had responded by shipping steel that had been fabricated or modified so that it was not caught in the tariff net. The federal government is also creating a “steel compliance team” within the Canada Border Services Agency to ensure that its policies are better enforced. Carney has said Canada is one of the countries “most exposed to the fundamental restructuring of the global steel industry.” It exports a lot of steel, but also uses a lot of steel per capita, so it has been “disproportionately open” to foreign steel to satisfy its own needs, he said this summer. The new 20 per cent quota on non-free trade countries comes closer to domestic steel producers’ calls earlier this year for the federal government to cut all steel imports — including from countries with free-trade agreements — to 20 per cent of their 2024 shipment volumes. But until Wednesday, Carney had been reluctant to impose significant quotas on free-trade partners’ steel imports. While he has not gone as far as the steel sector wanted, it is a step in the direction they requested. Still, some steel producers say the policy needs to be tightened even further. “They’re going to get to the point I told them to get to seven months ago,” Barry Zekelman, owner of Atlas Tube Inc. in Harrow, Ont., who also sits on the board of directors of the Canadian Steel Producers Association, said. “Why do they have to drag this out and make it so painful?” He is also calling for the federal government to enact a hard quota on foreign steel imports. Carney’s policy, known as a tariff rate quota, imposes a limit on the amount of steel that can be imported duty free. Zekelman said he wants a “hard quota” that limits the total volume of steel that can be imported at any duty rate. Still, he applauded the federal government’s other announcement that it will seek to lower the cost of rail shipments of domestically produced steel by 50 per cent. The government provided few details on that policy, but said it would work with Canadian National Railway Co. and Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd. to cut freight rates on interprovincial steel and lumber shipments by half beginning next spring. That move responds to concerns that it is too expensive to ship domestic steel from Ontario and Quebec, where many of the mills are based, to Western Canada. Ravi Kahlon, British Columbia’s minister of jobs and economic development, earlier this year said his province is concerned that steel import restrictions would cause prices to increase and potentially lead to shortages. B.C. imports about $4-billion worth of steel every year, he said, in part because bringing heavy steel shipments over the mountains and across the prairies can be more expensive than floating it across the Pacific Ocean by barge. The federal government also said it would implement its “Buy Canadian” strategy and require that all defence and construction projects worth more than $25 million prioritize Canadian materials, including steel and lumber. The Donald Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from June 2018 to May 2019 during his first term in office, though only 25 per cent rather than the current 50 per cent. Steel and aluminum exports fell by 50 per cent during that time, according to a Statistics Canada report released on Wednesday, but U.S. importers largely paid the costs through higher prices. Still, the agency said exporters that maintained relationships with U.S. customers also increased investments during this period. This time around, tariffs may be higher and last longer, the report said. “The point to be taken is that declining output, employment and investment in industries affected by tariffs are not a foregone conclusion,” the report said. • Email: gfriedman@postmedia.com Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Related India must urge the United States to withdraw the 25 per cent ""Russian oil"" tariffs before proceeding with any trade agreement, stated a report by the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). According to GTRI, India should first complete its exit from sanctioned Russian oil, then secure a rollback of the 25 per cent ""Russian oil"" tariff to restore competitiveness, and only afterward resume balanced trade negotiations with the U.S. on equal terms. GTRI stated, ""India to first complete its exit from sanctioned Russian oil, then secure a rollback of the 25 per cent 'Russian oil"" tariff to restore competitiveness."" The report added that India has already ended oil imports from sanctioned Russian firms, a step that President Donald Trump has acknowledged. With Step 1 complete, India should now focus on securing the tariff rollback. Once Russian oil imports have been curtailed, India must press Washington to withdraw the 25 per cent tariff, which would reduce the overall U.S. duty burden on Indian goods from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. This move would help boost competitiveness in key sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery, and pharmaceuticals, without rushing into a full trade deal. After the tariffs come down to 25 per cent, the report recommended that India resume trade talks with the U.S. for a balanced agreement, aiming for parity with partners like the European Union and targeting average industrial tariffs of about 15 per cent. The report also advised India to wait for the U.S. Supreme Court's verdict on the Trump tariffs. The Court is currently hearing a major case on whether the president has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose such tariffs. On November 11, 2025, President Donald Trump said the United States and India were ""pretty close"" to a trade deal and promised to lower tariffs on India. He added that India had ""stopped buying Russian oil very substantially"" and that the tariffs would soon be brought down.

"Officials relayed these messages over the last several days to stakeholders in government and private industry, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations. A fourth person following the matter also said the administration was taking a more cautious approach to avoid provoking China. The discussions have not been previously reported. Trump aides are taking their time on chip tariffs as they work to avoid a rupture with Beijing over trade issues, which would risk a return to a tit-for-tat trade war and disruption of the flow of critical rare earth minerals, according to two of the people. Those people cautioned that no decision is final until the administration signs off on it, and also said that triple-digit tariffs could be imposed at any time. The sources spoke anonymously in order to recount private conversations about policy deliberations. Trump said in August that the United States would impose a tariff of about 100% on imports of semiconductors but exempted companies that are manufacturing in the U.S. or have committed to do so. Privately, over the last several months, Washington officials had told people that the administration would roll out the tariffs soon. That guidance has now changed as the administration has continued to debate the timing and other details. A White House spokesman and a Commerce Department official, asked about the discussions, disputed that the administration had adjusted its posture. ""The Trump Administration remains committed to using every lever of executive power to reshore the manufacturing that's critical to our national and economic security,"" said the spokesman, Kush Desai. ""Any anonymously-sourced reports suggesting otherwise are simply Fake News."" The Commerce official said, ""There is no change in department policy regarding semiconductor 232 tariffs."" Neither specified how soon tariffs that have been threatened since the early days of the Trump administration would be finalized, nor did they offer any other details. TRUMP FACES PRESSURE ON CONSUMER PRICES Any decision by the administration to slow down or narrow the scope of chip tariffs would come at a sensitive time for Trump. The Republican president is facing growing consumer angst over prices heading into the holiday shopping season. Hiking taxes on imported semiconductors could raise consumer costs on the gadgets they power, from refrigerators to smartphones. Reuters reported in September that the Trump administration was looking at a plan that would also tax foreign electronic devices based on the number of chips in each one. Trump rolled back tariffs on more than 200 food products last week, but he has also said that his import taxes have made no significant contribution to inflation. The U.S. government shutdown has delayed recent data on consumer prices, but inflation has been running above the Federal Reserve's target since former President Joe Biden held office. Trump is also trying to maintain a delicate trade truce with China, a top manufacturer of both semiconductors and devices powered by them. Last month, Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, and reached an agreement to set aside their trade issues, for now. During those conversations in Korea, U.S. officials nonetheless warned their Chinese counterparts that they could take national security steps in the coming months that Beijing might find objectionable, according to two people familiar with those conversations. Trump has bet that tariffs can revive domestic factory jobs lost over decades to countries including China. In April, the Trump administration announced investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat.

"The Fed’s Tariff Obsession Is Dangerous Federal Reserve hawks may be on the verge of making a reckless bet based on incomplete information. They’re focused on their own conviction that a tariff-driven price increase in goods is building up behind the scenes, causing them to fear that further rate cuts risk reigniting inflation. But they’re ignoring substantial demand weakness in the underlying consumer data that undermines their entire case. The hawks worry that businesses are currently absorbing tariff costs but will pass them along in 2026, creating persistent inflation. And although the headline inflation numbers were milder than expected in September, the hawks point to data showing that a measure of consumer prices excluding energy and food accelerated to 3.6 percent annualized over the three months through September, according to the Wall Street Journal, up from 2.4 percent in the three-month period through June. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on June 25, 2025, in Washington, DC. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)Focusing on that data point, however, suggests a conviction in search of data to support it rather than a sober analysis. Annualizing the most recent three months of data can be useful for detecting a trend, but it can also be misleading if not viewed through a longer framework. Goods prices rose at an annualized rate of 2.8 percent in the three months through September. Viewed alone, that looks like an alarming inflationary trend. But year-over-year, goods prices are up just 1.5 percent, which suggests the acceleration over the past few months is more like a reversion to the mean, with goods prices playing catch-up. Consumer Spending Is Uneven, Job Market Worries Mount Consumer spending data also hurts the hawkish case. In the absence of official retail sales numbers, which haven’t been produced due to the government shutdown, we look to Bank of America data on credit and debt card spending. The most recent data shows that lower-income households are spending only 0.7 percent more year-over-year compared to 2.7 percent for higher-income households. Debit card spending is accelerating faster than credit card spending, suggesting households are shifting to cash-flow-conscious behavior. The Bank of America survey found 62 percent of households reporting financial strain, with 87 percent of those planning to shop at discount stores. This doesn’t match the profile of an economy where businesses can confidently pass on higher costs, whether from tariffs or otherwise. The labor market is telling a similar story. Monthly payroll job growth has collapsed from 168,000 in 2024 to just 29,000 through August. No doubt, this partly reflects reduced immigration, with hiring slowing because the supply of available workers has contracted. But there is also reason to be concerned about the demand for labor. Construction employment looks poised to deteriorate as the commercial real estate is clearly in a recession and residential builders are likely to downsize payrolls as they scale down projects to deal with an overstuffed inventory of unsold new homes. A Harris Poll conducted for Bloomberg News found 55 percent of employed Americans are concerned about job loss, with 48 percent believing comparable work would take four months to find. “Recession-like dynamics across several different industries increases the risk of additional layoffs in the quarters ahead. Because the hiring rate is low, a small increase in layoffs may have outsized effects on unemployment. Just because conditions seem to be gradually cooling today does not close the door on a more abrupt shift in labor market conditions later. Downside risks remain high,” Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro wrote in a recent note to clients. The hawks’ case really rests on their seemingly unmovable conviction that barely visible tariff-driven price increases will accelerate and become widespread as businesses eventually pass costs along. But weak demand and fear of job insecurity makes that unlikely. When consumers are barely spending, switching to discount stores, and anxious about jobs, businesses can’t sustain price increases.

"From the minute Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Brazil, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva bet the US leader was going all-in on a weak hand. The wager paid off Thursday, when Trump limped away from the battle. In an executive order, Trump exempted dozens of Brazilian food products, including coffee and beef, from the 40% increased tariffs he imposed in an ill-fated attempt to help former President Jair Bolsonaro dodge a coup attempt trial. Together with prior exemptions, the move will leave many of the nation’s major exports free from heightened US duties, a victory for an agricultural powerhouse that ranks as the world’s largest beef and coffee producer and counts the US as its No. 2 trade partner. It’s an even bigger win for Lula, the 80-year-old leftist who staked his once-struggling presidency on the fight with Trump, and may have just provided a model for how similarly-situated nations should approach the combative American leader. About 22% of Brazilian exports to the US are now facing tariffs, down from 36%, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin said Friday. Trump is notoriously unpredictable and doesn’t like to lose, and broader trade talks are ongoing. But for now, at least, Lula appears to have triumphed on Brazil’s most important products without making any major concessions, a feat few others have managed. To the Brazilian and his team, it’s vindication of a strategy that mixed outright defiance with patience and a dash of charm, a cocktail that allowed Lula to outlast a counterpart who’d underestimated the domestic cost of a trade war with a nation that produces so many goods Americans love to consume. “Everybody panicked and got nervous, but I don’t usually make decisions when I have a fever,” Lula said at an event in Sao Paulo after the exemptions were unveiled. “Today I’m happy.” From the start, Lula and his closest allies believed they had decent odds in their favor, even as they braced for a potential 1% tariff hit to Latin America’s largest economy. After Trump threatened levies if Bolsonaro’s trial went forward in July, the government resolved that it wouldn’t blink, according to an adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Instead, Lula would make the case that Trump and Bolsonaro — whose son had moved to the US to lobby for sanctions on Brazil — were threatening its sovereignty and intervening in domestic affairs. While he wielded a sharp tongue toward Trump in public, Lula left the door open for negotiations and made calculated arguments against the economic logic of the levies. Brazil, he often pointed out, typically runs an annual trade deficit with the US, the type of relationship Trump says he wants. His government reasoned that Trump would ultimately realize he couldn’t save Bolsonaro from a Supreme Court over which Lula had no authority, the adviser said. And because the US depends heavily on Brazilian coffee, meat and other products, it sensed that American price pains would eventually push Trump to the table. Lula was emboldened by rising approval ratings and early moves from Trump, who exempted hundreds of goods from the tariffs before they even went into effect. He stood firm even when high-level communication with Washington ceased and Trump ramped up the pressure with sanctions on Brazilian officials. Lula’s team long believed that if they could get the leaders in the same room, the famously charismatic president could win Trump over with charm he’s used to woo leaders like George W. Bush and Emmanuel Macron in the past. Finally, in September, it happened: Just two weeks after Bolsonaro’s conviction, Trump raved that he and Lula had “excellent chemistry” during a brief encounter at the United Nations. He described their subsequent phone call, in which Bolsonaro was never mentioned, as “very good.” Trump and Lula then emerged from an October meeting in Malaysia talking about a deal. By then, the predicted US economic pain had materialized. Coffee futures spiked to record levels as stocks of Brazilian beans in exchange-monitored warehouses fell to the lowest levels since 2020, while beef prices surged as restrictions on Brazil added to domestic shortages. Stockpiles of Brazilian coffee held by roasters in the US had fallen to near zero ahead of the reprieve, said Marcio Ferreira, the chairman of Brazilian coffee exporters group Cecafé. US officials have cast the exemptions as part of a broader strategy amid ongoing negotiations. A majority of Americans, however, say Trump’s doing more to hurt the economy than help it, recent polls show. Lula, by contrast, is in a much different spot a year from Brazil’s 2026 election. He ranked as South America’s most popular leader in October, while Bolsonaro’s legal woes have thrown the Brazilian right Trump sought to rally into disarray. The tariff reprieve also came at a fortuitous time, after a deadly police raid in Rio de Janeiro pushed violence and crime to the forefront of political conversations, exposing potential vulnerabilities for Lula. Now other world leaders may look to him as an example. Lula met with South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday ahead of the Group of 20 nations summit in Johannesburg, a gathering Trump is boycotting amid that ongoing feud. Lula is willing to “help however he can, of course,” if his fellow BRICS member felt he needed support, top foreign policy adviser Celso Amorim told reporters in South Africa. Lula’s primary aim is to cinch a broader trade framework with the US, and Brazil’s foreign ministry said Thursday it will keep pushing for a deal. Sensitive issues like big tech regulation and critical minerals are likely to feature, and the US sanctions on Brazilian officials remain in place. But after months under Trump’s glare, Lula clearly senses he’s on the cusp of total victory. “I just wanted to tell President Trump the following: I’m going to thank you only partially,” Lula said in a video posted to social media. “I’ll thank you fully when everything between us is agreed upon.”",right
"Businesses press Supreme Court to strike down Donald Trump's emergency tariff power About 40 briefs have been filed challenging signature policy ahead of showpiece hearing Businesses, lawmakers and former United States officials are pressing the U.S. Supreme Court to rule against Donald Trump’s use of emergency tariff powers ahead of a showpiece hearing this week. About 40 legal briefs have been filed by groups ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to former national security officials in opposition to the signature policy the U.S. president has relied on to wage his trade wars. Trump said on Sunday that he will not attend Wednesday’s hearing, but described it as “one of the most important cases in the history of our country.” “If a President was not able to quickly and nimbly use the power of Tariffs, we would be defenceless, leading perhaps even to the ruination of our Nation,” he wrote on Truth Social. His lawyers argue that depriving the president of the authority to impose the tariffs would “thrust America back to the brink of economic catastrophe.” The Chamber of Commerce, the U.S.’s largest business association, counters that “the irreparable harms already suffered by American businesses large and small underscore the vast economic consequences of the President’s tariffs.” It says the uncertainty triggered by Trump’s approach is prompting businesses to delay capital investments and consumers to hold off purchasing. “The ruling is going to be fundamental and foundational for the president’s agenda going forward,” said Everett Eissenstat, a lawyer at Squire Patton Boggs and former Trump economic official. “I guarantee you that law students are going to be reading about this court case for a long time.” The case could also determine the future of more than US$50 billion in extra tariff revenue that the U.S. government has collected in 2025, a windfall that has soothed investors nervous about U.S. borrowing levels. - The Trump doctrine: don't rely on America - The Trump supremacy - Advertisement 1Story continues below Although the hearing will be held this week, the justices will take at least several weeks to deliberate before issuing a ruling. Think tanks lodging legal briefs against the measure include the pro-market Cato and Goldwater institutes. Law professors and former judges have also lined up against Trump’s use of emergency tariff powers, as have serving lawmakers and former officials from both Democrat and Republican administrations. Only a handful of briefs — fewer than 10 as of late last week — backed the president. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said lawmakers hoped to send a “clear statement” to the court. “These tariffs are not only increasing costs for American families, but they’re also not doing anything to bring back manufacturing jobs we’ve lost,” she told the Financial Times. While the U.S. constitution gives powers over tariffs and revenue-raising to Congress, it allows the U.S. president to have broad sway over foreign policy decisions. “Trade agreements are the perfect amalgamation of those two authorities coming together,” said Eissenstat. “It’s a fundamental constitutional question that the country’s been struggling with for 100 or 200 years and more.” Trump declared the U.S.’s persistent trade deficit a national emergency this year, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to apply sweeping tariffs on almost all U.S. trading partners. Two separate lower courts have already ruled that the president does not have the authority to apply tariffs using that statute. The filing by Trump’s lawyers cites a forecast from the independent Congressional Budget Office that the tariffs imposed using emergency powers will reduce the U.S. deficit by US$4 trillion over the next decade. “To the president, these cases present a stark choice: with tariffs we are a rich nation, without tariffs we are a poorer nation,” they write. Although the case could undermine the specific legal basis for Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs,” and the levies imposed to retaliate for fentanyl, it would not affect duties applied to sectors including autos and steel. Foreign officials and diplomats maintain that the Trump administration will seek to use alternative legal measures to impose tariffs if the use of emergency powers is curtailed by the court. “We know that the president will maintain tariffs regardless of what the court says,” said Kathleen Claussen, a law professor at Georgetown and former U.S. trade official. “That’s not to say he would ignore the court…It’s just to say that he has many other ways to apply tariffs.” © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Bitcoin Ethereum XRP Price Today, Analysis, Prediction and Solana Cardano BNB Dogecoin $TRUMP TRON Performance Bitcoin rose on Thursday, recovering part of its earlier losses as traders took advantage of lower prices. Economic uncertainty and cooling expectations for U.S. rate cuts limited the rebound. The world’s largest cryptocurrency slipped into a bear market earlier this week after falling over 20% from its October highs.Bitcoin climbed 1.7% to $103,744 by 23:35 ET (04:35 GMT), after briefly dropping below $100,000 earlier in the week, marking its lowest level since June. Global Warnings Over Crypto Market Bubble World Economic Forum President Borge Brende cautioned about a possible crypto bubble during an event in Brazil. He also warned of similar risks in artificial intelligence and government debt. These warnings fueled market concerns and contributed to this week’s sell-offs, spilling over from equity markets into digital assets.Bitcoin’s losses in November followed weaker-than-expected performance in October. The crypto lost about 5% last month, breaking seven consecutive years of October gains. Since early October, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have underperformed other risk assets, losing nearly $500 billion in value after a market flash crash. Robinhood’s Crypto Revenue and Market Reaction Robinhood Markets Inc. reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings driven by higher trading volumes. However, its crypto revenue of $268 million missed Bloomberg estimates. The company’s shares fell 4% in after-hours trading. Robinhood also announced that CFO Jason Warnick will step down in early 2026, with Shiv Verma taking over the role.Altcoin Performance and Market Sentiment Altcoins followed Bitcoin’s modest recovery. Ethereum rose 3.7% to $3,450, while XRP gained 5.1% to $2.35. Solana increased by 3.2% to $162, and Cardano and BNB climbed between 1.5% and 2%. Dogecoin advanced 1.2%, while $TRUMP surged nearly 16% despite no clear catalyst.Uncertainty over the U.S. economy and the ongoing government shutdown continued to weigh on sentiment. Cooling expectations of a December rate cut by the Federal Reserve added to market caution. Analyst Tim Enneking noted that Bitcoin’s $100,000 level remains a key psychological and technical support. Enneking said this level acts as a magnet, with quick recoveries following every drop below it. Bitcoin Key Support and Resistance Levels Independent crypto analyst William Noble said Bitcoin must hold between $101,000 and $103,000 to avoid further declines. A fall below $98,000 could push prices toward $95,000, especially if stock markets or banking systems face stress.Analyst Joe DiPasquale identified $98,000 as a key support zone, with potential downside to $88,000 if it fails. Armando Aguilar noted lower supports at $96,000 and $94,000. On the upside, resistance levels appear between $105,000 and $112,000, with higher hurdles at $116,000 and $123,000. A sustained move above $115,000 could open the path toward new all-time highs beyond $126,000. U.S. Supreme Court Tariff Hearing Impacts Crypto Crypto prices today rose partly due to developments at the U.S. Supreme Court regarding President Trump’s reciprocal tariff policies. A potential ruling against the tariffs could reduce inflation and improve the case for rate cuts.According to Polymarket data, the odds of Trump winning the case have dropped from 43% to 20%. Lower inflation expectations often support digital asset growth, as rate cuts boost liquidity and investor appetite for risk assets. Futures Market and ETF Flows Data from CoinGlass showed futures open interest increased 2.13% to $143 billion, signaling improving market participation. However, ETF flows remained mixed. Bitcoin ETFs recorded $137 million in outflows, while Ethereum ETFs saw $118 million in withdrawals, marking their sixth consecutive day of losses. Solana ETFs, meanwhile, logged $9.7 million in inflows.Ripple’s New Partnerships Boost XRP Ripple Labs received attention after announcing partnerships with Citadel and Fortress Capital, valuing the company at $40 billion. Ripple also teamed up with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini to test RLUSD stablecoin settlements on the XRP Ledger. This aims to use blockchain for fiat card payment settlements, showing institutional interest in blockchain adoption.Crypto Market Outlook Crypto prices today show recovery but uncertainty persists. Analysts warn the rebound may be temporary, urging traders to watch the Supreme Court tariff decision, ETF flows, and overall economic trends before making decisions.The crypto market’s current recovery phase follows weeks of volatility driven by global economic data and investor uncertainty. Bitcoin Ethereum XRP price today, analysis, prediction and Solana Cardano BNB Dogecoin $TRUMP TRON performance reflect how traders are positioning ahead of potential monetary policy shifts. Market analysts believe that sustained institutional participation, along with positive regulatory clarity, could help stabilize prices in the coming weeks. However, rising U.S. bond yields and inflation concerns continue to limit gains across digital assets, suggesting that short-term fluctuations may persist until clearer signals emerge from central banks and policy makers. FAQs 1. Why is Bitcoin rising today?Bitcoin’s rise above $103,000 is linked to optimism around U.S. tariff rulings and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, both of which could improve liquidity for digital assets. 2. How are Ethereum and altcoins performing? Ethereum rose 2.29% to $3,423, while altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Cardano gained modestly. The rise reflects stronger investor confidence in blockchain applications and market recovery trends.

"On this episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, cohosts Diane Brady, executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media, and editorial director Kristin Stoller talk with Ulta Beauty CEO Kecia Steelman. They discuss Steelman’s journey from team lead at Target to the C-suite; how Gen Z and social media have upended the beauty business; and what beauty trends are on the rise. Listen to the episode or read the transcript below. Transcript: Kecia Steelman: I often say I have a PhD in life. I was poor, hungry, and determined. Diane Brady: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Leadership Next. The podcast about the people… Kristin Stoller: …and trends… Brady: …that are shaping the future of business. I’m Diane Brady. Stoller: And I’m Kristin Stoller. Brady: And this week, Kristin, Ulta Beauty, straight from the MPW Summit in Washington. Stoller: Yes, so, we spoke with Kecia Steelman, who is Ulta’s CEO, at our Most Powerful Women Summit in Washington, D.C. And we got to speak to her 10 months into the job. She transitioned from COO to CEO. We got to hear a lot about what she was doing, what the transition was like, and her past, which is really interesting. Brady: I love her past. She’s from a very modest background, and she literally worked her way up from the shop floor, in essence, at Target, to where she is today, which I think gives her a real down-to-earth kind of appeal. She was a mother at a very young age. It felt like we were getting somebody who truly represents mainstream America, which—this is a mainstream-America brand. Stoller: I think so. And right after this, she and I did a conversation onstage, and she got the whole crowd clapping when she was talking about how she’d been passed over for promotions in her career. And she said, I always live by this motto, It’s better, not bitter. And got, you know, thunderous applause. Brady: And let’s point out to our listeners, MPW means Most Powerful Women. So that would get a lot of applause in that crowd. What is the appeal of this brand, in your mind? Stoller: When I hear Ulta, I think of social media. I think of Gen Z. I think of Gen Alpha. They are really loving this brand, loving going to the stores, making videos, and Ulta has been really smart about who they choose to partner with. I mean, last summer, they partnered with Beyoncé. She had a great story for us about meeting Beyoncé and the Cowboy Carter tour. And these partnerships, I think, are essential to what makes them resonate with such a young audience. Brady: Lots to learn. She’s on an international expansion, she’s facing huge headwinds with tariffs and other challenges. And of course, beauty is a competitive space. So I hope everybody enjoys, and let’s have a listen. Brady: Cities are home to the majority of the world’s population and account for 80% of global GDP. That makes the health and sustainability of our cities critical to creating a prosperous future. And of course, business has a role to play. Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte US, is the sponsor of this podcast, and he joins us now. Jason, great to see you. Jason Girzadas: Great to see you, Diane. Thanks for having me. Brady: So, how should businesses play a role in creating more vibrant and sustainable cities? Girzadas: It’s clear to me that the health of cities is inextricably linked to business’s viability and success. I think it starts with an awareness or a recognition of that mutually dependent reality. I think the how is around collaboration. It’s bringing to bear the capabilities of businesses to support cities’ renewal and innovation. To understand the criticality of cities’s role around economic prosperity, innovation, as well as cultural exchange. Stoller: Jason, could you give us some examples of successful urban transformation projects that have been driven by these innovative business practices? Girzadas: I’m proud to say that Deloitte, back in 2023, we started an effort called Yes SF. Here in San Francisco, where I live, the launch of Yes SF, with other business collaborators, has brought together our competencies around stimulating interest amongst innovators to bring sustainability and technology innovation to benefit the city itself. Stoller: Excellent. Well, that sounds like a very cool project. Thank you so much for sharing it with us. Girzadas: Thank you. Brady: Thanks, Jason. Stoller: Kecia, thank you so much for joining us here in Washington, D.C., at our Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit. Steelman: I am so excited to be with you here today. Stoller: Thank you. So you’re 10 months in. You transitioned from COO to CEO at an interesting time for the world, but just give us a sense—how is it going? What has your first 10 months been like? Steelman: Well, I’ve got to just start off by saying it has been so much fun. I feel like I have, in so many ways, I have the dream job for so many young girls that are out there. You know, when I jumped into this role, there were three things that I was really focused on now. The first one was getting the right team. You have to have the right team around you, not only for today, but also for the future and our future growth. The second was really having decision-making rights and clarity around who makes the decision. Making them with speed. And, you know, I often say spinning is my least favorite move, so having the ability for the team to make decisions to move forward. And then the third is really around having a great strategy that everyone understands in the organization, from that frontline associate all the way to the board of directors, and the role that they play in it. I think that’s allowed me to really hit the ground running since I’ve been here, 10 months. We’ve had a lot of great things happening and a lot of change, but it’s been a lot of fun. Brady: You know, I noticed the stock price is doing very well. It was funny, because it had a little dip, and then it went roaring back. And I always think that’s the best way, as women leaders, to say, I’ll show you. But obviously you were COO, which I think of as sort of the shape-shifter of the C-suite—you take on all sorts of different operational roles. So tell us a bit about the difference when you get to be a CEO—obviously there’s a top, but does it feel a lot different, since you knew the operation so well to begin with? Steelman: Yes and no. What I would say is that I do know the operations really well, and I know the people. I’m a people-first leader, so I do know the organization, and I felt like I saw where there were opportunities when I stepped into the big role to be able to make some pretty immediate impacts. I’d say one of the big changes, though, is more the external-facing—how much time you’re spending with the investment committee. I was doing that before, but not to the same degree that I am right now. Spending a lot of time with the brands. I was traditionally more on the operation side of the business, so I really started to convert spending a lot more time with the senior brand leaders: Estee Lauder, L’Oréal, LVMH, and then also some of our smaller brands, too, to just have them get to know me, for me to come in with a fresh perspective. And I think that’s actually been really refreshing. The way that we’re going to market now as a collective group and team, and through some barriers, the brands are responding really well. So I’d say those are some of the shifts that I’ve had in roles. Brady: Marshall Goldsmith wrote this book that says, What Got You Here Won’t Get You There. It’s really that the skills that get you into a CEO job aren’t necessarily the skills that help you succeed in that role. Would you say that’s the case? Anything personal come to mind? Steelman: I think there’s no finish line for learning, no matter what role you’re in, whether it’s a COO or a CEO position. So you’ve got to always be continuing to lean in and learn and challenge yourself to be even better. You know, the role from the COO to the CEO, the buck stops with you as the CEO. You also have to really learn how to manage with the board, and to leverage your board to get the most out of them and help you be the best CEO you can be. I just think constantly learning and growing and being open and surrounding myself with fantastic people has always been critical to my success, and I believe it’s going to be critical to my success in the CEO world, too. Stoller: I want to talk about your global expansion, because you announced you’re expanding Ulta to Mexico. You’re looking at the Middle East, which is really exciting, and you’ve gotten to travel to all of these places. So I’m curious when you hear from customers and consumers in all of these markets, what do they want that’s different from your beauty consumers here in the U.S.? Steelman: What’s so interesting is [that] the role of social media has really changed in how the world has come much closer together than we’ve ever been before. For example, in the Middle East, they are beauty gurus there. They love beauty. They’ve got time to spend on beauty. They’re experts in this space. They love all the trends that they’re seeing in the United States. So I see a lot of what they want is what they’re seeing already happening here. You know, color is really important. They are very aligned with the fashion industry. So we just had some recent runway shows come with some new designers like Chanel, Dior. What you’re seeing translate on the runway definitely translates into the looks that they’re desiring. But I had so much fun—I had a couple of small groups with influencers and prominent people within the industry who were females. And sitting at those tables, it was kind of refreshing, because it doesn’t matter how far away around the world I was, we were talking about some of the same things that women are talking about here in the United States. Husbands, makeup… Brady: …before we get to husbands—and I do want to ask about makeup, because I feel like, first of all, my look, sometimes I worry it’s cryogenically frozen from the certain age when you start getting into makeup. But what are the trends right now? Here we are, late 2025, give us a sense, then, of the tastes that we should be keeping an eye on? Steelman: Yeah, I think there’s a—first of all, you look fantastic. Brady: Thank you, and so do you. Steelman: There are a couple trends that we’re seeing—there’s still a little bit of the no makeup-makeup look, which actually takes quite a bit of makeup to have that. But then we’re seeing glam come back. So it’s called, like a modern glam. It’s a little bit heavier makeup usage on the eyes, which we really love to hear, because you have more products that you need to use. A little bit softer on the cheeks and a nice pop on the lips. And we’re seeing different colors being used on lips, too. People are getting a little bit more creative. You’ll see even a purple-ish type of gloss, etc. So they’re really pushing the boundaries a little bit more on the lip. And we’re also seeing a younger consumer get engaged with makeup, with skincare, more than what we’ve ever seen before. So 13-year-olds, it’s not uncommon for them to be definitely doing a lot more makeup looks. But individuals as young as 8, 9, 10, on skin. And one of the things that I feel is really important for us at Ulta Beauty is to be very responsible in making sure that we’re educating not only that consumer, but the parent also in what’s good, safe skincare for that younger generation to be using. But I love them starting with us that young, because we’re wanting to keep them with us for the lifetime. So that lifetime value when you’re starting at 8 is much greater than when you’re starting in your mid-teens. Stoller: Well, that’s a really good point, because on TikTok, Instagram, I see all these young girls—like you’re saying, 8 or 9—going to your stores, using your products. But I also think, like, You’re 8, why do you need an anti-aging serum? Brady: Eight-year-old girls want to look good, too. Stoller: I know you said responsible, but how do you market toward those young girls without saying, Oh, you actually don’t need this, but you should buy it. I don’t know—how do you think about it? Steelman: Well, I think that we want to be very socially responsible. We want to be a destination for everyone, no matter what their age is. You know, one of the other trends that we’re really seeing is these young boys and young men coming in with their friends, and they’re engaged in cologne. And layering colognes. They like to create their own signature scent by mixing a couple different scents together. So I love seeing that trend, too. Young girls are into cologne, too, and fragrances. But this young men trend is also something that I’m seeing change right in front of me, and I think, again, it’s the power of social media and TikTok. Steelman: I wouldn’t say that. It’s never that we’ve not decided to carry a product online. We have a responsibility for education. And education, to me, for our associates, to make sure that they know what’s safe to use for everyone. That’s a responsibility that we really have in our stores, and we do invest a lot in our training and education. We want to be accessible for everyone, against all price points and age at the same time. But, you know, we’re really educating the parents. And you know, when we see somebody that’s trying to buy a category, we are definitely encouraging them to look for a different alternative. Clean and conscious beauty is an area that we’re continuing to lean into. So, yeah, the fact that we do carry everything from low to lux, clean to those that are chemical based, we have something for everyone in the store. Stoller: Has the male consumer been a big growth area for you? Steelman: Yeah, not heavy makeup, but concealer. You know, now that we have these Zoom calls where you’re front and center more and more, there are filters that can go on. They still like that look after they’re off of the Zoom calls, where they want to have that flawless skin look. So we see them investing in skin, maybe a little bit more concealer, that’s where I’m seeing that trend. A little bronzer, a little bit of that doesn’t hurt anybody. Steelman: Well, first of all, I couldn’t be more proud of being from where I’m from—a small town called Mediapolis, Iowa. I didn’t necessarily grow up at a farm, it was more of a farming community. I’d say we were probably poor to middle class. All of my friends were the same, so we didn’t know anything different. Being really grounded in and humble with my beginnings, I wouldn’t change that, as I said, for the world. We made our own fun. In fact, a quick fun story is that I made my own store in the basement. So I started as a retail entrepreneur very early in my career. Brady: What were you selling? Steelman: Anything I could take from my mom and put a price tag on and invite my friends over. So I think retail was in my blood from early on. But again, when I go back home—my mom still lives in the home I grew up in, my sister lives about 20 minutes away from her—it brings me a sense of being very grounded, and I really appreciate that. I’ll never forget that. Stoller: And then, how did you get from there to Target? Tell us about that journey. Steelman: Yeah, I started at Target making $8 an hour. Stoller: What’d you do? Steelman I was the men’s and ready-to-wear team leader, that’s what they called it, so I had floor responsibility for those areas of business. And then I just loved what I was doing, and I was working so much overtime that they promoted me. I think if I do the math now, I was actually making less money, because I was making more money on overtime. But my career just took off, and I spent 12 years at Target, and I’m so thankful that I started my career there, because they really invest in you as an individual and your self-leadership skills. And I’d say that’s where I really fine-honed my leadership capabilities: how to build great teams and what that looked like, and how to grow yourself as a leader, too, not just at the task, but also personal development. Steelman: I often say I have a PhD in life. I was poor, hungry, and determined, and you know, I think that keeps me also very grounded. I value education, though, for those that have been able to do it. I look for what I call the “it factor” in someone. Someone that’s hungry, even when you go to school after you graduate—that’s just the beginning of a learning journey. We need to all be lifelong learners. So when I see individuals that have been blessed at having the opportunity for education, but understand the importance of continuing to learn and grow themselves and want more and are driving and striving for even more—those are the people I want to have on my team. Stoller: Do you have any mentors that have really helped you along the way? Brady: Your own personal board of directors, or your own literal board, of both? Steelman: I have both. I’m blessed to have a fantastic board of directors at Ulta Beauty, but I have a personal board of directors. A group of people that I call for different things that really kind of happened over the last few years, but the one person that I call, no matter what, is my mom. My mom is someone who is still very grounded. She started her own business herself in a small town, and very driven, and she’ll tell me the truth. Which, you need those truth tellers in your life, and she’s that for me. Stoller: And you’re a grandmother. Brady: Any thoughts that you have, just in terms of you growing up in the business? You had your first child at 20, I believe. How was that a factor in terms of the choices that you made? Steelman: Well, I will say that, early on in my career, I was often the only woman that was there. And I put that internal pressure on myself of being the first one in and probably the last one to leave to show that I was committed. I’m blessed that I have over 91% women working for me, and I do not expect them to do that today, so I work really hard to pay it forward. You know, my thing with raising kids when I was young—if you try to be balanced all the time, you’re going to fail. It’s perfectly imbalanced, and you need to give yourself permission and grace for that. To me, it’s really about the quality of time that you’re spending, not the quantity. So when I was with my family, I was really hyper-focused, and then I would go do what I needed to do with my career. But you know, my kids, I couldn’t be more proud. They’re all very successful individuals—off of my payroll, which is really important. Yeah, and you know, they’re all in jobs that they love, and I think being a role model, because I loved my job, I really did. I love retail, that’s what’s kept me in it for so long—having them see a role model of someone that worked really hard but loved what they did at the same time. Encourage them to get into the right profession for themselves. Stoller: I want to talk about the retail industry and the beauty industry—both really hard spaces. Especially with beauty, you have all the influencers out there selling things today. You have Amazon, Sephora, you have all these other people that you’re competing with. How do you stand out in this really crowded market? Brady: Yeah, it’s hard to get a great makeover with a depressed beauty consultant. I think also the hard decisions are what shape us as leaders. And I’m thinking about what didn’t work. And one thing that comes to mind, I don’t know what the backstory is, is when you did this partnership with Target, what did you learn from that? I know that unwound. Any thoughts as to what, how that shapes your direction going forward? Stoller: And can you define what Ulta Beauty Unleashed means? Brady: But from a product point of view, you’ve obviously faced the challenges with tariffs and some of the other general headwinds people are seeing. The dollar falling—how are you dealing with that? Steelman: The tariff impact to us is a little bit less from a direct perspective, but we have some components. Our Ulta Beauty collection is imported, so the direct import on tariff pressure for us is not as high as what you’re hearing in soft goods-type companies. Now some of our brands, of course, that’s some of the pressure that we’re seeing, but they haven’t necessarily put that price pressure yet on the consumer. Now, that could change, but we’re not seeing it. A lot of our products, especially in prestige, are MSRP priced… Brady: …Manufacturer-suggested retail prices… Stoller: One of the things I think has been most fun to watch your brand do this year is the Beyoncé Cowboy Carter partnership you have. So one, did you get to meet Beyoncé? I’m so curious. Steelman: I did. Stoller: Okay, you’ve got to tell us about that. I need to know everything. Stoller: And I’m assuming you got to go to the concert, too. Brady: Perks of the job. Brady: I want to ask a bit about the evolution of influencer marketing, because it’s such a busy space. There’s such a tsunami of stuff coming at us all the time. How do you see the evolution? Obviously, you work with people like Beyoncé. That’s a no-brainer to me. But to Kristin’s point earlier about Instagram, the more micro-celebrities. Do you see any shift there? Steelman: Yeah, I think social relevance and influencers are here to stay. I think AI could continue to play a part of that in the future, but I think, to me, authentic communication and engagement is what’s really important. I don’t think it’s a well-known fact, but we actually have three ways in which we’re leveraging influencers with our consumers, day in and day out. The first one is called UB Creators. So these are the people that are what you call more funnel—they’re advertising products, you can click on it and purchase. So that’s one group that we’ve got within our ecosystem. Then we also have the Ulta Beauty Collective, which is a larger group that is talking about education. They’re not our employees, but they’re talking about education. They get briefings from us. They get the products from us so they can trial them. It’s authentic marketing. You’re talking about marketing, but you’re not purchasing, but it might change your purchasing behavior. And then the third, which I am the most excited about, is our Ulta Beauties that we have, which are our own associates who have sent in tapes of what they’ve done and how they can communicate on social media. Not only are they working for us in stores, but we also are paying them to be able to to build an influencer group externally. These are our own associates that are just—they live and breathe Ulta Beauty. They represent our brand. I could not be more proud when I see one of them come up on my social reels. They get it. They’re authentic. They’re real. But those are three ways that we’re really bringing this to life. And I think you’ve got to play in the space in order to be a part of the conversation. Even Beyoncé, part of the concert that you were mentioning, you have to be where the social activity is happening, especially with the younger consumer. You want to be a part of the conversation, and you have to really lean into social to be able to do that. Stoller: Do you have a dream partner or someone you would really want to collaborate with in the future? Stoller: I knew that was going to come out of your mouth. Steelman: I wouldn’t turn Taylor away. Stoller: I don’t think any of us would. Stoller: Yes, the engagement was huge. Brady: I normally would not ask somebody about their beauty routine or their wellness routine, but you have to take your own medicine, drink your own Kool-Aid, the whole bit. Obviously people hold you to a certain standard, given the brand you represent. So what have you learned about effectively doing your makeup and having a wellness routine? Because time is precious as a CEO. Brady: I love that. Well you can have one brand, right? You’re the CEO of Ulta Beauty. Steelman: If I had to pick one, I would say that the Ulta Beauty collection, the lip gloss is really good. So Ulta Beauty collection lip gloss is a great staple, but I like to try them all. Stoller: That’s always fun. And I need to know, what are your predictions for next year? What do you think is going to be hot in 2026? What are the trends in the beauty space we’re going to see? Brady: Certainly, that’s certainly true for me. And let’s go back. You’ve said you’ve been passionate your whole life about retail, but yet you’ve learned a lot along the way. So what would you say is advice, either to your younger self or to the next group starting out in this space? Steelman: Maybe two different things. To my younger self. I would say, Have a little more grace for yourself. I was a pretty hard-charging driver early on, and I should have been a little bit kinder to myself. So that would be the one thing I would say to myself. To the younger generation, I would say, prepare hard to finish easy. And really invest in your education, your experiences. Take a lot of different opportunities. Don’t put yourself just in the eye of one specific job. Learn from everyone that’s around you. And when you feel like you’re starting to get a little bit bored or complacent in your role, challenge yourself to go do something different. That’s how you learn and grow. Brady: Yeah, I love that. Brady: Thank you, and thanks for being here as one of our most powerful women. Brady:Leadership Next is produced and edited by Hélène Estèves. Brady: Our head of video is Adam Banicki.

"COIMBATORE: Textile Association of India (TAI) expects that the crisis caused by the US tariff hike -- which affected the apparel industry the most -- will be resolved by December, said a TAI office-bearer. âThe apparel industry is capital, power and labour intensive. The raw material price is much higher than the international cost. Almost 30% of textile export is to the US. It is not the entire sector that has got affected, but sectors like bed linen are facing the consequences,â said K Ramalingam who is the convenor of the 78th All India Textile Conference which TAI is hosting here on Nov 21 and 22. The theme of the conference is âGlobal Textiles: Unearthing Opportunities.â Around 600 delegates from all over the country are expected to participate in it. 'Love Us Again': Donald Trump Offers Fair Trade Deal, Promises To Reduce India Tariffs After Tension Ramalingam said industrial excellence awards would be presented to Durai Palanisamy, executive director, Pallavaa Group, and L S Manivannan, chairman and MD, LS Mills Ltd, Theni, during the conference. Speaking about power tariff hike in Tamil Nadu, TAI Coimbatore unit secretary Sivakumar said, âMost of the players are becoming self-dependent by shifting to renewable energy. At present, most of them use a portion of their power consumption through solar or wind. Also, with emerging hybrid models of renewable power, people are exploring ways to be more self-reliant.â",right
"Groww IPO to Test India's Investor Appetite After Lenskart's Muted Debut Before the trading day starts we bring you a digest of the key news and events that are likely to move markets. Today we look at: (Bloomberg) — Before the trading day starts we bring you a digest of the key news and events that are likely to move markets. Today we look at: - Tech earnings outlook - Hedge fund-styled products - RBI to the rescue Good morning, this is Ashutosh Joshi, an equities reporter in Mumbai. Indian stocks look poised for another positive start after two days of gains, buoyed by upbeat global cues as the US government shutdown nears an end. Locally, all eyes are on the trading debut of Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd., the parent of India’s largest online broker, Groww. The listing is the latest test of investor appetite following Lenskart’s muted debut earlier this week. Traders also have one eye on politics, with exit polls showing Prime Minister Modi’s alliance leading in Bihar state elections. A potential win would boost Modi’s authority, though such polls are known to surprise. On the data front, a report due today may show retail inflation eased further on softer food prices, fueling hopes of RBI policy support. IT earnings may have bottomed out Some IT services companies surprised in the September quarter, with growth that topped beaten-down expectations. While the demand environment may remain challenging amid macro and tariff uncertainties, Nuvama says it remains positive on medium- and long-term outlook as technology spending is expected to recover. Earnings estimates have been adequately cut and stocks have corrected sharply, making current valuations attractive, the brokerage noted. Infosys and HCL Technologies raised the lower end of their fiscal year 2026 revenue guidance, while others maintained their outlook. Steady debut for hedge fund-styled products India’s much-awaited specialized investment funds (SIFs) — products that offer sophisticated strategies to individuals with at least one million rupees to invest — had a steady debut in October. SIFs allow money managers to short stocks, use derivatives and pursue absolute-return strategies. Last month, four such products — one equity long-short fund and three hybrid funds — raised a total of 20 billion rupees ($226 million) from about 10,000 investor accounts, according to AMFI, the industry body. While SIFs are expected to trigger a migration from existing alternative investment funds — products aimed at wealthy investors — it’s a long road ahead before they can rival AIFs and mutual funds. RBI does its bit to ease tariff pain The central bank is supporting the rupee and debt markets as harsh US tariffs take a toll on local assets. In recent days, the authority has signaled unease with investors pushing for higher government bond yields, and data suggests it has bought about $2 billion of bonds to cool borrowing costs. At the same time, it is estimated to have sold about $20 billion in dollars from its reserves to stop the rupee from making new lows. Essentially, the RBI is trying to hold the line as the country navigates one of its toughest external shocks in years, with officials saying the long-awaited deal is nearing. Analysts actions: - Bajaj Finance Cut to Reduce at Emkay Global; PT 1,000 rupees - Hitachi Energy India Reinstated Buy at William O’Neil - Bharat Forge Cut to Sell at Asian Markets; PT 1,000 rupees Three great reads from Bloomberg today: - Trump’s Visa Curbs to Accelerate Wall Street’s India Expansion - ‘Big-Talking’ Billionaire’s Legacy Threatened by Nidec Scandal - Matt Levine’s Money Stuff: The Hedge Funds Are Hiring And, finally.. The IPO market in India remains hot, with almost $17 billion raised this year and more offerings lined up for the final weeks of 2025. However, the boom in new listings seems to have weighed on block trades and share placements by listed firms, causing a dip in such deals. Waning cash turnover on local bourses also points to a slowdown in block trade activity, even as the depth of the Indian market and strong domestic liquidity continue to provide easy exits for large investors. —With assistance from Alex Gabriel Simon, Ravil Shirodkar and Bhaskar Dutta.

"Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) said that Democrats were using the suffering of Americans for “leverage” in the government shutdown. Host Kristen Welker said, “I do want to ask you about the people who are suffering right now. You have talked about this, this SNAP, the food assistance program, roughly 42 million people, Senator, rely on this. That ran out of funds on November 1st. The Trump administration has fought this all the way up to the Supreme Court to not fully fund this critical food assistance program. What do you say to the allegations made by many Democrats that the Trump administration is simply weaponizing hunger?” Lankford said, “Yeah, this is the spin. Literally, this is the painful spin that people across the country are saying: ‘I’m so sick of the politics.’ And that’s been just fixed. The problem is, 14 times we voted to reopen the government two weeks ago, we brought a bill that would fully fund SNAP for the entire year. Last week, we brought a bill that would just pay our federal employees. Democrats have voted no, no, no, no, every single time because the goal for them is leverage. If you listen to the things they say over and over again, they say people are suffering. But that gives us more leverage in our debate here. He added, “Listen, people don’t want leverage. They want to get access to food. And I would only say President Trump diverted tariff revenue into the wake, funding women, infants and children’s funding to be able to make sure their programs stay solid. The problem with Snap is you would have to take funds away from the disaster aid that’s there if we have a hurricane that comes in, or take it away from the school lunch program. So it’s this terrible choice the president has to make, take it away from the school lunch program or deal with SNAP, he said over and over, open the government. That’s the solution.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format Proposed $600 Stimulus Check Stalls in Congress The proposal, led by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, was first introduced in July, as per a report. Hawley’s American Worker Rebate Act calls for a minimum of $600 per adult and dependent child, meaning a family of four could receive $2,400. The plan is designed to return tariff-generated revenue to Americans, echoing the stimulus checks distributed during the pandemic.Senator Josh Hawley’s American Worker Rebate Act Hawley said, Americans deserve a tax rebate after four years of Biden policies that have devastated families’ savings and livelihoods,"" adding, “Like President Trump proposed, my legislation would allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump’s tariffs are returning to this country,” as quoted by The Sun.ALSO READ: Government shutdown fallout: How your money, social security and investments could take a hit Minimal Progress in Congress Despite the promise, progress on the bill has been minimal. According to congressional records, it’s been read twice and referred to the Senate Committee on Finance, but has no cosponsors. Finance expert Michael Ryan, founder of MichaelRyanMoney.com, told Newsweek that he doubts the legislation will advance, citing the absence of support from Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo.Other Stimulus Proposals and Ideas The idea of tariff rebates has circulated for months, gaining traction earlier this year after Elon Musk discussed a similar plan under the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

"At Fleece & Harmony, a woolen mill and yarn shop in bucolic Belfast, Prince Edward Island, in Canada, owner Kim Doherty used to be able to send yarn skeins to U.S. customers across the border with little fanfare. The yarn orders usually met an import tax exemption for packages valued at under $800, meaning it could be imported tariff-free and avoid the customs process. But ever since the Trump administration eliminated the exemption as of Aug. 29, the cost to send yarn to U.S. customers has skyrocketed. The bill for a $21 ball of yarn now includes $12 to $15 in brokerage fees that her shipper UPS charges, plus state taxes and a 6.5% tariff, all of which almost doubles her costs. “We had orders that have reached the customers and they’re in shock about the fact that they have to pay,” she said. “And it’s amazing how many people really didn’t know what the impact was going to be.” Getting rid of the so-called de minimis exemption was meant to curb drug trafficking and stop low-quality goods from discount sellers like Temu and Shein flooding the U.S. market. But as the all-important annual holiday shopping season kicks off, it is putting a crimp on small businesses and shoppers now facing higher costs. Chad Lundquist in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, ordered fragrance oil from a site called Oil Perfumery in October, but he didn’t realize the business was based in Toronto, Canada. His total was $35.75, which included an $8 standard shipping fee. But when his package arrived, he was hit with a $10.80 tariff bill from FedEx. “It wasn’t worth the $10 tariff for a $27 purchase,” Lundquist said. Oil Perfumery did not respond to a request for comment. He’s not the only skittish shopper. Three months after the exemption ended, sellers abroad are reporting drastic declines in U.S. sales. Some are paying the duties themselves instead of passing them to consumers. They are also trying to focus on domestic customers to replace U.S. ones and adjusting product lineups to feature best selling items to try to goose sales. Martha Keith, founder of British stationery brand Martha Brook, which is based in London with a small office in Melbourne, Australia, said U.S. sales from her Etsy store — her main e-commerce channel in addition to her own website — were up 50% for the year before the exemption ended. But sales fell dramatically when the tariffs hit, and continue to drop even though she’s paying the import taxes and customs fees herself so customers aren’t impacted. Sales are down about 30% year-over-year. “The issue seems to be in customer confidence hitting the desire to order from businesses outside of the U.S., because of confusion about how the tariffs will affect them,” Keith said. She’s also in a bind because she sold a £109 ($144) stationery advent calendar to about 200 U.S. customers ahead of the tariffs, and now she has to ship them. Shipping and tariffs will cost a combined £25 ($33), meaning Keith will have to find an additional £5,000 ($6,583) to cover shipping the advent calendars already sold. “The whole thing has been a bit of a nightmare for businesses like ours, and such a huge shame, as the U.S. market was such a valuable growth area for us, particularly through Etsy,” she said. The timing was particularly bad for Sue Bacarro, who along with her sister co-owns Digi Wildflowers, an Etsy shop that sells embroidered baby blankets, gifts and custom quilts for wedding and anniversaries, located across the border from Detroit in Windsor, Ontario. Before the announcement of the removal of the de minimis exemption, they placed a large inventory order to prepare for the holiday season and early 2026 demand. But when the de minimis exemption ended, “inventory wasn’t moving as expected, and we suspected customers were hesitant to purchase due to potential duty charges,” Bacarro said. Sales — 70% of which come from Americans — finally started to rebound when Digi Wildflowers prominently added a banner on its site that said, “U.S. Import Duties On Us.” “Heading into this holiday season, we’re keeping that message front and center through banners, social media, and direct communication,” said Bacarro, who is also expanding their product line. But not all businesses can — or want to — pick up the tariff tab. Kim Doherty, who runs the woolen mill on Prince Edward Island, doesn’t plan to pay the tariff and fees for her customers. “I’m not in a position as a small business owner to do that. The profit margins are already rather thin,” said Doherty, adding that “on principle,” she shouldn’t have to do it. Right now, her shipments to U.S. customers are about 10% of what they were. Instead, she’s working on expanding her fiber offerings to Canadian customers at her brick-and-mortar store and fiber festivals. “We’ll see what happens,” she said. “I’m pretty sure that my U.S. customers were shopping and not even thinking about it, but now they’ll be evaluating the purchases that they’re making, knowing that they are going to have the extra fees on top of whatever they see.” Some Etsy businesses have been stymied by international postal services temporarily halting deliveries to the U.S. because of the confusion around the ending of de minimis. Selene Pierangelini’s business, Apricot Rain Creations, based in Brisbane, Australia, which sells crystals, candles, and spiritual wellness products on Etsy, depended on the Australia Post to get deliveries to U.S. customers. More than three-fourths of her customer base comes from the U.S. Australia Post suspended service to the U.S. for about a month, resuming on Sept. 22. She temporarily switched to FedEx and UPS — private shippers that are more expensive than Australia Post. Since it resumed, Australia Post is working with Zonos, a provider of cross-border shipping technology, to offer a shipping calculator that lets her prepay duties and fees. They themselves charge a fee of $1.69 plus 10% of the total duty fee. So far, the items she ships from Australia have been tariffed at a 10% rate, the baseline tariff for the country. She increased her shipping costs to help cover the expense. It is manageable, but tricky, she said. “You don’t really know how much (the cost) is going to be until the package clears custom in the U.S., and you get an invoice which is automatically paid out of your account,” she said. And her sales have not recovered. Before the tariffs, her U.S. sales were about 85% of her total sales, and now they’re around 35%. She’s hopeful people are just holding off until Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday sales. In the meantime, she has restarted sales to Europe, which she had paused in 2024 due to increased regulations. And she’s launched a Facebook marketing campaign and is exploring print-on-demand services from U.S.-based providers for production and fulfillment. “This situation highlights how fragile small businesses can be when dependent on one market,” Pierangelini said. “While it has been a shock, it’s also pushed me to diversify — something that will hopefully make my business stronger and more resilient in the long run.”",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format Speaking to ET Now, Shetty said the market is now “following earnings, not sentiment,” with management commentaries post-festive season pointing to stabilising demand and the end of negative earnings surprises. “H2 should be a lot better, and some upgrades are likely,” he noted. Valuations back in comfort zone After months of time-wise correction, valuations—especially in largecaps—are no longer stretched. Shetty believes the market is “very well positioned” for a steady uptrend, supported by the GST cut, better monsoons, an expected India–US tariff deal, and the upcoming Union Budget.Value emerging in banks, IT & insurance While the broader market is not cheap, Shetty highlighted strong pockets of opportunity:Private sector banks: Valuations below long-term averages; credit books cleaner; potential for re-rating. IT services: Pessimism around AI and H-1B costs is “fully priced in,” with the weak rupee acting as a tailwind. Shetty said Quantum Advisors has “large allocations” to these segments. Industrials & consumer staples may lag Despite a strong run, Shetty warned that industrial stocks are reflecting frothy valuations, similar to the 2003–07 cycle, without corresponding earnings.“There is no reason to pay 60x earnings for 10–12% growth,” he said, adding the same applies to consumer staples, which remain expensive even after corrections. Discretionary play via autos Shetty prefers to ride the consumption recovery through automobiles rather than staples, citing better valuations and benefits from GST rate cuts.FIIs may return as China trade eases Foreign investor outflows—largely triggered by global EM funds rotating back into China—may now normalise, he said. “Most investors are still underweight India relative to what they should hold.” As fundamentals strengthen, long-term pools like pension and sovereign funds are expected to increase allocations.Long-term outlook: Stable & upward With expected GDP growth of ~6.5% and corporate revenue growth of 12–13%, Shetty sees a balanced environment for steady earnings expansion.“There are enough catalysts in place for markets to move higher—whether in December or January doesn’t matter. For a 1–2 year investor, India looks structurally strong.” If you'd like, I can also create a 60-word meta description, social media snippets, or a Google Discover slideshow for this story.

"Trade Policy Is the New Monetary Policy The new San Francisco Fed paper on tariffs that we’ve been discussing this week opens the door for using customs duties in a way that the economics profession has almost never considered: as a macroeconomic policy tool. Over 150 years of history in the U.S., U.K., and France, Régis Barnichon and Aayush Singh find that a tariff hike raises unemployment and lowers inflation. In other words, tariffs work the way we think tax hikes and monetary policy work. Which means we should start to think of them as part of the toolkit for keeping the U.S. economy from going awry. What’s more, it means we should rethink how tariffs are managed by the government. If tariffs reliably move inflation and unemployment, then they should be data-dependent, dynamic, and discretionary. And that implies that tariffs should sit primarily in the hands of the executive. (iStock/Getty Images)The Tariff Tool Kit Start from the San Francisco Fed’s bare facts. A sizable tariff hike historically raises unemployment and lowers inflation, across multiple countries and regimes. That alone tells you two things. First, tariffs are not just “sectoral distortions” off in relative-price land. They show up in aggregate variables in a consistent way. Second, they have the same sign pattern as monetary or fiscal tightening: prices cool, joblessness ticks up. If you saw the same impulse responses after a rate hike, nobody would say, “Rates are immoral and must never change.” You’d say, “Okay, rates are a macro instrument. The question is how to use them.” Tariffs should be treated the same way. Not as a taboo, not as an identity statement about whether you’re a free trader, but as one more knob that moves inflation and employment. Once you see them that way, three design principles follow naturally. Tariffs Should Be Data-Dependent If tariffs have macro effects, they shouldn’t be frozen into a 20-year schedule negotiated by trade lawyers. They should respond to the state of the economy. Barnichon and Singh’s estimates imply a simple, almost Taylor-rule logic: When unemployment is very low and inflation is high, tariffs behave like a disinflationary tool with only a modest employment cost. When unemployment is high and inflation is soft, higher tariffs are counterproductive—they push in the same direction as the slump. So, from the point of view of workers who both earn wages and buy goods, a simple rule of thumb emerges: If unemployment is low and inflation is high, tariffs are too low. If unemployment is high and inflation is low, tariffs are too high. That is exactly what “data-dependent” means. You don’t fix the tariff schedule in Geneva and walk away. You look at unemployment and inflation and adjust tariff policy to the state of the cycle. We let the Fed move rates meeting by meeting. Why should tariffs be locked in stone regardless of whether the economy is booming or in a slump? Tariffs Should Be Dynamic The paper’s other important contribution is historical: tariff changes over 150 years are not tightly tied to the business cycle. Different parties raised and cut tariffs for political reasons at all points in the cycle. In other words, the world accidentally ran a lot of tariff experiments at random times. That’s what lets the authors estimate causal effects in the first place. The lesson is not “never touch tariffs again.” The lesson is: stop doing this accidentally. If tariffs move inflation and unemployment, they should be moved on purpose, and more often. Raise tariffs when the labor market is extremely tight and prices are running hot. Cut tariffs when unemployment is elevated and you need all the demand and hiring you can get. Dynamic tariffs are not some radical innovation. We already adjust interest rates every six weeks, regulations in response to crises, energy policies after price shocks. We just pretend tariffs are sacred and must be set once per trade agreement and then treated as permanent. The SF Fed paper is a giant flashing sign saying, “Tariffs are macro-relevant. Stop pretending they’re static.” Tariffs Should Be Discretionary Once you say “tariffs should respond to current data,” you’re also saying: Tariff policy needs discretion, not just rules. You cannot hard-code into statute: “If unemployment is below four percent and CPI is above three percent, raise the average tariff by X.” Real-world shocks are messy. You need judgment about how broad the tariffs should be, which countries and sectors are involved, and how tariffs interact with immigration, tax, and monetary policy. That kind of real-time, cross-cutting judgment is exactly what we elect a president to exercise. Congress is not built to do this. Legislating tariffs is slow, infrequent, and larded with logrolling and parochial interests. International agreements are even worse as macro tools—they lock the U.S. into multi-year schedules negotiated under totally different economic conditions. If tariffs are going to be data-dependent (responsive to unemployment and inflation), dynamic (adjusted as conditions change), and discretionary (used with judgment alongside rates, taxes, and immigration), then they almost by definition have to be controlled by the executive branch—subject to statutes and oversight, but with real day-to-day authority in the White House. In practice, that means making peace with something like what Trump has already done de facto: broad delegated authority over tariffs under existing laws, used in response to perceived macro and geopolitical conditions, rather than as a once-a-generation tweak to the WTO schedule. The Fed and Tariffs Should Work Together If tariffs reliably lower inflation and raise unemployment, they are not competitors to monetary policy—they are inputs to the Fed’s reaction function. A sensible division of labor would look like this: The president uses tariffs (and immigration and tax policy) to shape the structure of production and the distribution of gains. The Fed sets interest rates using tariffs as data. If the White House has just imposed a disinflationary, growth-dampening tariff shock, the Fed should lean a bit easier, not tighter. But that only works if we stop pretending tariffs are “just about trade,” and we stop pretending the sign is unknown. The San Francisco Fed has told us: tariffs, historically, are disinflationary. Once you know that, the only rational response is to treat tariffs as part of the macro toolkit and put them where real-time, data-dependent, discretionary tools belong: under the control of the executive, guided by economic conditions, not locked away in a museum case labeled “Smoot-Hawley—Never Touch.” COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"President Donald Trump will propose a two-year extension to enhanced subsidies under the Affordable Care Act to avoid a massive spike in premiums next year, sources told Politico. The proposal would require a minimum premium payment and limit eligibility for the subsidies, which come in the form of tax credits, to enrollees with income up to 700% of the federal poverty line, the report said. The administration is also seeking an option that would let enrollees get part of their tax credit through a savings account, according to Politico. That’s after Trump had suggested earlier that consumers receive subsidies directly. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, shares of insurer Centene, which is a top participant in public health exchanges, jumped 8% on Monday, Molina Healthcare rallied 5%, and Oscar Health soared 24%. Without an extension of the subsidies, consumers who buy policies on the ACA marketplace would see insurance premiums more than double on average. Millions of Americans have already gotten sticker shock as open enrollment for 2026 began earlier this month. The subsidies were at the center of the longest government shutdown in history as Democrats pushed to renew the COVID-era aid, while Republicans and the White House insisted on letting them expire at year’s end. The shutdown ended without a renewal, with Democrats only getting a promise for a vote in the Senate. But the GOP’s stunning losses in this month’s off-year elections highlighted affordability as a top voter concern. Since then, Trump has rolled back tariffs hitting groceries, floated a $2,000 tariff “dividend” payment, and backed an idea for a 50-year mortgage meant to lower monthly payments. Trump’s Oval Office meeting on Friday with New York City Mayor–elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, was also surprisingly friendly as the president emphasized their common ground on improving affordability rather than wide ideological differences. A two-year extension for the subsidies would notably stretch beyond next year’s midterm elections, potentially giving Republicans some political cover amid fears of a Democratic wave. Letting them expire, however, would risk significant voter backlash in GOP strongholds, as more than half of the 24 million enrollees receiving the subsidies live in a handful of Southern states. A KFF analysis last month of ACA marketplace data found 57% of enrollees live in congressional districts represented by a Republican. In fact, all congressional districts in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina have at least 10% of their populations enrolled in ACA plans, according to KFF. That goes for nearly all districts in Texas and Utah. “While a relatively small share of the national population gets their coverage through the ACA marketplaces, in some districts, the number of ACA enrollees could be enough to swing a close election,” KFF said last month.",right
"Candace Laing is the president and chief executive of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. We have turned Canada’s major-project announcements into what feels like a raffle, with everyone from investors to businesses to economists checking to see whose number comes up. According to the federal government, there are hundreds upon hundreds of major projects in the federal inventory, 32 considered for Major Projects Office attention, and only 11 hand-picked so far. On Thursday, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a handful more of the winners, but our eyes immediately turned to those who once again missed out this round. “If you’re lucky, the government will pick you” cannot be the long-term message we send to project proponents and investors. To get things built in Canada, we need “one project, one review” to be more than a slogan. It must be a binding and uniting principle. It’s simply fairness. While the new major projects legislation is a workaround for the time being, we ultimately need one consistent process. And it can’t be a fast lane for a few marquee projects alongside an endless lineup for everyone else. A patchwork system of approvals will leave holes in our already lagging economic growth – our new Canadian Chamber of Commerce GDP nowcast tool is showing a measly 1.5-per-cent growth for the third quarter. Decoding the Major Projects Office, the centrepiece of Carney’s nation-building plans It’s an economic imperative to jump-start projects of all sizes right now, given the slow and low growth that’s signalling fragility. Our Business Data Lab’s third quarter of 2025 survey shows that after five consecutive quarters of decline, overall business confidence is merely holding flat. Firms remain cautious, weighed down by trade uncertainty, tariff pressures and policy ambiguity. Many are hesitant to commit to costly capital investments in the current business climate. Despite significant policy movement recently, capital is quietly flowing elsewhere. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, Statistics Canada says, the country experienced a net outflow of $43.7-billion from portfolio investments. That’s foreign and domestic investors alike choosing other jurisdictions. This quiet exodus is a warning: When the rules are opaque or uneven, investors don’t wait around. They move elsewhere. At a time when the U.S. is weaponizing tax and regulatory tools and investors are carefully comparing competitiveness, Canada cannot afford to fall behind. Our self-imposed productivity problem is seeing us drop in the international rankings. As of 2023, the OECD ranked us the second-lowest in GDP per hour worked among the G7. The United States is at the top, producing $24 in GDP more per hour per person than us. If these disadvantages continue, setting up and maintaining a business in Canada will start from a comparatively weak position, making it more and more attractive for global companies to look elsewhere. The Major Projects Office rests on a simple premise: Too many projects were not completed or even started when we need them. But as the Association of Consulting Engineering Companies rightly says: “All projects are major projects.” The risk of a two-tier system that leaves smaller, regional or non-“national interest” projects to languish is real. If only a fraction of our country’s projects ever proceed, then investors will know it’s a feature, not a bug. Opinion: We must make Canada worth investing in We need bold action that creates a consistent environment in which all eligible projects have a clear, fair path – one that attracts and retains capital while respecting Indigenous rights, environmental assessments and community consultation. We also need a regulatory and tax environment that encourages growth and launches new ventures. While tariffs dominate headlines today, structural changes in U.S. tax and regulatory regimes – the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and its ripple effects – will challenge Canada’s long-term competitiveness if we don’t act. The government’s Red Tape Review, which highlighted 500 achievements and forward-looking actions, is encouraging, but it is only a starting point. Incremental fixes will not be enough. To truly build investor confidence and transform our economy, the next step must be a systemic review of the project approval framework. One predictable process, applied consistently, is what will signal that Canada is a place where business can thrive and capital will choose to stay. If we fail to fix the patchwork, the raffle mentality will persist. Businesses are left to gamble on their odds. Investors and entrepreneurs need more than chance. They need a system they can trust. That’s the principle we must live by: one project, one review, one process. Get that right and Canada’s economic future will be far more secure than any lottery ticket could ever promise.",right
"Canada's corporations churning out profits despite tariff hit The data show Canada’s companies holding up well overall despite the ongoing pressures of United States trade policy Canada’s corporations continue to expand their profits, even as the economy contends with tariff damage. Operating profits rose 3.8 per cent to $200 billion in the third quarter, according to data released Monday by Statistics Canada. That’s the fastest pace of growth in two years and follows a seasonally adjusted contraction of 2.4 per cent in the second quarter. In the financial sector, earnings before interest and taxes rose six per cent to $96 billion, driven higher by lower provisions for credit losses and increased non-interest income in banking, the agency said. Non-financial industries also expanded their operating profits 1.9 per cent between July and September, and increases were recorded in 25 of 39 subcategories. Profits rose in 10 of 14 of the country’s manufacturing industries. The data show Canada’s companies holding up well overall despite the ongoing pressures of United States trade policy and an elevated unemployment rate. Major tariffs remain in place on steel, aluminum, autos and lumber products, and the central bank expects meagre economic growth in the second half of 2025 as business investment and exports languish. At the same time, many of Canada’s goods exports to the U.S. are exempt from duties provided they’re covered by the free trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, leaving the country with a relatively low effective tariff rate. “Tariffs are having a brutal but narrow hit,” said Fred Demers, head strategist of multi-asset solutions with BMO Global Asset Management. “Firms are defending strong profit margins and investors should remain comfortable,” he said. —With assistance from Mario Baker Ramirez.

"Canada's retail sales slow to weakest pace in more than a year Latest data will do little to move needle on Bank of Canada decision Canadian consumer spending slowed in the third quarter as a painful trade war with the United States persisted and population growth continued to wind down. Retail sales grew 0.2 per cent between July and September after rising 0.3 per cent in the previous quarter, according to Statistics Canada data Friday. September sales fell 0.7 per cent, matching the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists, while a flash estimate suggested October sales were flat. The quarterly retail figures — the weakest pace in more than a year — underscore consumer caution around spending in the face of economic and tariff uncertainty. They also likely reflect federal immigration curbs that have slowed Canada’s once-explosive population gains to a crawl. The Bank of Canada plans to move to the sidelines after cutting its benchmark overnight rate to 2.25 per cent, saying rates are at “about the right level” if the economy and inflation evolve as it expects. The central bank foresees household consumption slowing due to the immigration changes and a soft labor market. In volume terms, retail sales fell 0.3 per cent on the quarter and dropped 0.8 per cent in September. Overall, sales were down in six of nine subsectors that month, led by autos, a volatile category this year amid US tariffs. Bank of Canada surveys have shown Canadians expect the levies to cause vehicle prices to surge. Motor vehicle sales fell 2.9 per cent in September, the first decline in three months and led by lower receipts at new car dealers. Still, auto purchases were still up 7.4 per cent in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period last year, likely reflecting a rush by some consumers to get ahead of the tariff impacts. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.2 per cent on the month, beating economists’ expectations for a 0.5 per cent decline. This suggests underlying consumer spending is holding up, Charles St-Arnaud, chief economist at Alberta Central, said in an email. Still, he said the quarterly slowdown suggests consumer spending only contributed marginally to gross domestic product growth in the third quarter, which likely rose a meagre 0.4 per cent on an annualized basis. Statistics Canada reports those figures Nov. 28. “Whether the labour market continues to be resilient remains key for the economic outlook,” he said. Core retail sales, which exclude gas stations and car dealers, were relatively unchanged in September. The largest decrease to core retail sales came from building material and garden equipment dealers, which fell 2 per cent and recorded a third monthly drop, while sales also dipped at general merchandise stores. The largest increase to core retail sales came from food and beverage retailers, which rose 0.8 per cent and were led by growth at beer, wine and liquor retailers, followed by supermarkets and grocery stores. In September, sales declined in six of 10 provinces. The largest provincial decrease in dollar terms was seen in Ontario, the country’s manufacturing heartland, which dropped 1.2 per cent while sales in Toronto were down 2.3 per cent. British Columbia saw a decline of 0.9 per cent, with a 1 per cent drop in Vancouver. The statistics agency didn’t provide details for the October estimate, which is based on responses from 54.2 per cent of companies surveyed. “Canadian retail sales continue a holding pattern as support from lower interest rates faces headwinds from trade uncertainty,” Shelly Kaushik, senior economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a report to investors. “The bigger picture is one of mild economic growth that will do little to move the needle for the Bank of Canada heading into its December meeting.” — With assistance from Mario Baker Ramirez and Erik Hertzberg.

"UK will increase its spending on medicine under a zero-tariff deal with the US LONDON (AP) — The U.K. has secured a 0% tariff rate for all U.K. medicines exported to the U.S. for at least three years, officials said Monday, in return for the U.K. spending more on new medicines. Under the deal, the U.S. agreed to exempt U.K.-origin pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical ingredients, and medical technology from import taxes. The Trump administration said in return U.K. drugs firms committed to invest more in the U.S. and create more jobs. The U.K. government said the 0% rate on all of its pharmaceuticals exports was the lowest offered to any country. As part of the deal, it said the country’s National Health Service will spend around 25% more in new and effective treatments — the first major increase in such spending in over two decades. Officials said that means U.K. health authorities will now be able to approve medicines that deliver significant health improvements but might have previously been declined purely on cost-effectiveness grounds, including breakthrough cancer treatments or therapies for rare diseases. “This vital deal will ensure U.K. patients get the cutting-edge medicines they need sooner, and our world-leading UK firms keep developing the treatments that can change lives,” said Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said the deal was “an important step towards ensuring patients can access innovative medicines needed to improve wider NHS health outcomes.” “It should also put the U.K. in a stronger position to attract and retain global life science investment and advanced medicinal research,” said ABPI chief executive Richard Torbett. U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement “strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to U.S._U.K. pharmaceutical trade.” AstraZeneca is among pharmaceutical giants that have cancelled or paused their investments in the U.K. in recent months. U.S. ambassador Warren Stephens recently warned said American businesses will cut future investments if “there are not changes made and fast.” Earlier this year President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer agreed on a framework for a trade pact that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products, including beef and ethanol.

"Key things in the BFSI list this year included a) a dedicated refinance window on the lines of NHB for the NBFC sector; and b) alignment of long-term capital gains tax with fixed deposits to encourage deposit mobilisation. Finance Industry Development Council CEO Raman Aggarwal underlined the need for a dedicated refinance window for NBFCs. This, he said, will ensure a smooth and sustainable flow of funds. Money raised via this mechanism may be exclusively used to finance MSMEs and priority sectors, he added. Aggarwal told news agency PTI after the FM meeting that the industry is also asking for some tweaking in the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, which he said will benefit NBFCs with regard to debt recovery. As of now, the SARFAESI Act limit in this regard is Rs 20 lakh. The industry wants it reduced so that smaller NBFC players can be brought into the ambit as well. FIDC is making a case for reducing this limit to Rs 1 lakh (from the present Rs 20 lakh), PTI reported. Another key point in the wish list was the removal of TDS on non-individual borrowers as ""there is no extra revenue generated from this provision"". One of the recommendations pertained to education loans, with the industry seeking a notification for NBFCs for deduction in taxable income under section 80E on education loan interest. At the meeting with Sitharaman, representatives from the banking sector underlined the need to align long-term capital gains tax with fixed deposits, PTI reported citing sources. Such a move, industry people said, will encourage deposit mobilisation. According to banking industry representatives, income tax is levied on return generated from term deposits, which discourages people from putting their savings in FDs. Union Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs Anuradha Thakur, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran and other senior officials from the Ministry of Finance were also present in the meeting. This year's will be Nirmala Sitharaman's ninth budget. Budget 2026-27 comes in a difficult backdrop of major geopolitical upheavals and Trump's tariff blow on India. In the coming financial year, India will be staring at the issues of boosting demand, job creation and putting the economy on a sustained 8 per cent-plus growth path. According to government projections, India's economy is likely to grow between 6.3-6.8 per cent during the current fiscal year.

"South Korea Submits Special Bill Aimed at Cutting US Car Levies South Korea’s ruling party has proposed a special bill to implement the country’s $350 billion investment pledges to the US, paving the way for American tariffs on Korean automobiles to be lowered to 15% starting this month. (Bloomberg) — South Korea’s ruling party has proposed a special bill to implement the country’s $350 billion investment pledges to the US, paving the way for American tariffs on Korean automobiles to be lowered to 15% starting this month. The submission of the bill — which outlines how the pledged investments will be executed — was a prerequisite for reducing the 25% levy on South Korean vehicles to 15%, South Korean officials have said. “With the introduction of this special bill, the conditions are now in place to retroactively apply the tariff cut on automobiles and auto parts — from 25% to 15% — as of Nov. 1,” South Korea’s Finance Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. South Korea notified the US Secretary of Commerce of the move and requested a prompt publication of a notice in the Federal Register to confirm the modification to the tariffs as agreed, the ministry said. The bill said that a Korea-US strategic investment fund will be established, while a separate entity dedicated to running the fund up to 20 years will be set up to ensure efficient management. The tariff reduction is critical for Korean automakers, as the US accounted for nearly half of the industry’s $70.8 billion in vehicle exports in 2024, government data show. Automobiles and auto parts rank among South Korea’s largest export categories to the US. The two countries agreed to a broad framework that capped US tariffs on Korean goods at 15% in July but the 25% levy on autos and auto parts has remained in place while the two countries hashed out details of the investment fund. The deal was finalized during President Donald Trump’s visit to South Korea in October and the two sides issued a joint fact sheet earlier this month outlining their trade and security agreements. While both Japan and South Korea reached initial trade deals in July that included a drop in auto tariffs to 15%, the US didn’t lower the duty and essentially used that as a further leverage to finalize details of the investment funds. In Japan’s case it agreed to a memorandum of understanding in September that eventually led to the auto tariffs falling to 15% and giving its carmakers an advantage over South Korea. In South Korea’s case, the details took longer to hammer out as South Korea raised concerns over the impact of the funds on its currency. The US confirmation will finally give Seoul what was agreed in the summer. The investment pledge is a key pillar of their trade deal meant to channel Korean funds into strategic US industries including shipbuilding, energy and semiconductors. The bill also outlined that the fund will be sourced through earnings generated from managing South Korea’s foreign exchange reserves, entrusted by the government and the Bank of Korea, and by issuing government-backed bonds overseas. While the reduced levy represents relief compared with duties introduced earlier this year, it’s still much higher than rates in place before Trump took office in January. Exports are equivalent to more than 40% of Korea’s GDP. —With assistance from Haram Lim and Susie Kang. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"President Donald Trump issued a ""Complete and Total"" endorsement of Lone Star State Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday. Abbott, a Republican, launched his reelection campaign at an event in Houston on Sunday. In a Truth Social post on Tuesday evening, Trump called Abbott ""an exceptional Governor and man,"" declaring, ""HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!"" ""Greg Abbott is the strong and highly respected Governor of Texas, a State I love and WON BIG three times, including with 6.4 Million Votes in 2024 (The most Votes in History, BY FAR)!"" Trump wrote. ABBOTT DEPLOYS ‘ELITE TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD’ AFTER TRUMP CALLS FOR REINFORCEMENTS: ‘EVER READY’ He credited Abbott’s leadership for the successful passage of the Texas mid-decade redistricting bill that will potentially give Republicans an additional five congressional seats in the 2026 Midterm Elections. ""Thanks to Greg’s bold and effective Leadership, the wonderful people of Texas will have the opportunity to elect 5 new MAGA Republicans in the 2026 Midterm Elections with the passage of their new, fair, and much improved, Congressional Map — A BIG WIN for Republicans in The Lone Star State, and across the Country! "" wrote Trump. The president went on to tout many of Abbott’s priorities, saying, ""As Governor, Greg is also fighting tirelessly to Champion Texas Values, Grow the Economy, Cut Taxes and Regulations, Support our Amazing Farmers and Ranchers, Advance MADE IN THE U.S.A., Unleash American Energy Dominance, Promote School Choice, Keep our now very Secure Border, SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime, Murderers, and other Criminals from illegally entering our Country, Ensure LAW AND ORDER, Protect our Brave Military, Veterans, and Law Enforcement, and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment."" ""Greg Abbott has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-Election,"" he concluded. Abbott responded to the endorsement by calling it an ""honor."" ""Together, we’ve worked to secure our border and defend the values that keep Texas strong. President Trump has always been a champion for Texas,"" wrote Abbott, adding, ""I look forward to our ongoing work to build a stronger, safer, more prosperous Texas and America."" Abbott is seeking a fourth term in the Lone Star State. At his campaign launch on Sunday, Abbott outlined a sweeping property tax reform plan, addressing what has become one of the state’s most pressing, hot-button issues. ""It’s time to drive a stake through the heart of local property tax hikes for good,"" Abbott said. ""We are going to turn the tables on local taxing authorities, put the power with the people, and put an end to out-of-control property taxes in Texas."" Despite much speculation of Texas turning purple or even blue in recent years, Abbott has won each of his three previous elections by decisive margins. In 2022, he defeated the once-rising star, former Rep. Robert Francis ""Beto"" O’Rourke by over ten percentage points. TEXAS GOVERNOR REVEALS REASON WHY HE AND TRUMP HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SO CLOSELY In an interview with Fox News Digital in October, Abbott, whose National Guard troops were deployed in support of Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Chicago, revealed the ""substantive reason"" why he has such a good working relationship with the president: ""We both believe in the rule of law."" ""President Trump and I have a good, long-standing, working relationship, and there's a substantive reason behind that. We both believe in the rule of law. We both believe in public safety. We both believed in securing the borders,"" he explained. Abbott said that he and President Donald Trump are ""operating very closely aligned in ensuring that our country's going to be safe."" Abbott emphasized that the Trump administration shares a common vision with Texas, making them apt partners. ABBOTT VOWS TO IMPOSE A ‘100% TARIFF’ ON ANYONE MOVING FROM NYC TO TEXAS AFTER ELECTION DAY ""What Texas is trying to do is the same thing the United States is trying to do. And that is very simply, carrying out the functions of the federal government. One of them is immigration enforcement, and another is public safety. The National Guard from Texas [is] not there to police the city of Chicago or any other place. They are there to ensure the safety and security of the ability of federal officials to fulfill their constitutional duty to enforce the laws of the United States."" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Though he gave no indication of what other collaborations Texas might undertake with the Trump administration in the future, he said that Texas remains ready for whatever is needed. ""No one can accurately predict exactly what's going to happen in the future. What I can predict is how Texas will respond. And that is, whenever the country is in time of need, Texans will step up and help out any way we possibly can.""",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format Speaking at an interactive session organised by industry body PHDCCI in New Delhi, Azizi said Afghanistan sees strong potential for collaboration across mining, agriculture, health and pharmaceuticals, information technology, energy and textiles. Azizi, who arrived in India on a five-day visit along with a high-level delegation, invited Indian industrialists to explore “the current enabling environment” in Afghanistan. “There is a huge opportunity available in the mining industry, the agriculture sector, health and IT. I would like to kindly invite you to come and visit them,” he said, adding that his government remains committed to supporting foreign investors. The minister detailed a set of incentives aimed at attracting investments, including a 1 per cent tariff on raw materials and machinery, free land allocations, reliable power supply and proposed five-year tax exemptions for new industries — particularly those set up by returning Afghan refugees. He also encouraged participation from Afghan Sikh and Hindu communities, stressing that Afghanistan is working to ensure a “peaceful, inclusive and business-friendly environment”. Bilateral trade between India and Afghanistan currently stands at around $1 billion, with both sides agreeing to deepen cooperation. Measures include posting a commercial attache in each other’s embassies and reactivating the joint working group on trade, commerce and investment. Separately, the Indian government said air cargo services between the two countries will resume shortly. Anand Prakash, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of External Affairs, announced that the air freight corridor on the Kabul–Delhi and Kabul–Amritsar sectors “has been activated”, and cargo flights will begin “very soon”. “This will significantly enhance connectivity and further strengthen our trade and commercial ties,” he said, noting that both governments see “significant scope for further growth” in bilateral trade.

"China just placed its largest order of U.S. soybeans in two years, offering a sign of improving trade conditions after months of China snubbing American soybean farmers. This week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the sale of 792,000 metric tons of soybeans to China. The move follows a meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the end of last month to ease trade tensions, with China committing to resume orders of U.S. soybeans and purchase 12 million tons of of the crop by the end of the year, as well as at least 25 million tons in each of the next three years. Earlier this month, China bought 332,000 tons of U.S. soybeans, bringing the total so far in November to more than 1 million tons. COFCO, China’s largest state-owned agriculture and food business, had not ordered soybeans from the U.S. since May and had not purchased the crop since the 2025 U.S. harvest season began. These fresh purchases offer hope for U.S. farmers following months of tariff disputes that disincentivized China from purchasing American soybeans and effectively priced them out of the global market. It’s a good start, industry leaders said, but farmers want more assurance of a steady market moving forward. “We want to trust what we’ve heard,” Todd Main, the director of market development at the Illinois Soybean Association, told Fortune. At the same time, farmers are fed up with the uncertainty that has unaccompanied the trade policy of the Trump administration. “We are concerned about the volatility in the trade relationships,” Main continued. “It’s hard for people to make plans—whether that’s farmers planning for next year’s crop, or buyers that are planning to make big investments in equipment or facilities or what have you—where there’s lots of instability.” In 2024, soybeans made up about 20% of U.S. “cash crop receipts,” worth about $46.8 billion, according to USDA data. While about a quarter of those soybeans went to China, retaliatory tariffs as a result of trade disputes with Beijing hobbled the U.S. soybean industry while South American countries gobbled up market share. Brazil and Argentina are replacing U.S. farmers, with Brazil making up about 71% of China’s soybean imports, according to the American Soybean Association. Three decades ago, Brazil accounted for just 2% of those imports. A new trade era Even with thawing relations between the U.S. and China, soybean farmers have reason to be on edge about restoring trade ties. For one, the USDA’s figures for soybean exports could be skewed and harder for economists and farmers to interpret. The USDA may not be releasing up-to-date weekly export summaries for the rest of the year as a result of the shutdown slowing down the release of key data. Therefore, farmers and economists rely more on the USDA reporting flash sales, or crop purchases that exceed a certain volume and warrant their own report. Not everyone is sold on China’s commitment, either. StoneX chief commodities economist Arlan Suderman said in a note earlier this month that China’s data “provided no evidence to support the notion that there will be a substantial increase in state purchases to meet the 12 million metric ton commitment for calendar year 2025 as stated by the White House” and that China’s soybean processors have “zero financial incentive” to buy more U.S. supply because of the more affordable options from South America. Main is likewise skeptical. He said during Trump’s first term, China and the U.S. similarly made an agreement to resume soybean trade, but there was a delay in initial follow-through from China. The threat of future trade tensions hasn’t completely disappeared. The consequences of reopened tariff disputes between the U.S. and China would mean Brazil and Argentina would once again have another opportunity to expand their dominion over China’s soybean import market. “Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of soybeans, and so the real concern has been, if we have another trade war, we’re incentivizing faster expansion in South America, which has long-run effects for us,” Scott Gerlt, chief economist for the American Soybean Association, told Fortune. Still, soybean farmers aren’t completely at the mercy of fragile trade relations. Even before the 2025 slate of tariffs, soybean farmers have made inroads to diversify demand for their crops, including opening “soybean excellence centers” meant to provide training and best practices globally for soybean producers, as well as expand infrastructure to be able to process and distribute more soybeans domestically, according to Main. Others have found other trade partners, such as Southeast Asian buyers to partially offset lost business from China. “It’s not going to be just, OK, everything’s all better—or, everything’s a disaster,” Main said. “It’s going to be somewhere in between going forward.”",right
"William Watson: Carney takes up the art of the political deal Balancing opposed interests is key to an Alberta pipeline deal but also to next year's CUSMA talks, which will require concessions on dairy In a recent conversation with the podcaster John Batchelor, Conrad Black used the adjective “agile” to describe Mark Carney. Central bankers don’t always have to be agile but politicians do. As he closes out his first year in office, we’re going to see — Carney himself is going to see — whether he can master the art of the political deal. With all our political cracks and fissures, Canada is not an easy place to practice that art. In a just-published FP Comment column, Peter Flynn argues that decarbonization of our energy exports, which looks like it will be part of the Ottawa-Alberta pipeline deal, makes no sense. He’s almost certainly right. Building very expensive infrastructure, its costs measured in percentage points of GDP, to capture and bury emissions generated in the mining and processing of oil and gas mainly adds to our costs, making exports less likely — despite the fact that global emissions would fall if other countries switched from coal and dirtier oil even to our un-decarbonized product. But, much as it pains me to say so, economics isn’t everything. Though suspect on economic grounds, carbon capture and storage may make political sense. They give Carney a fig leaf and a palm frond in dealing with caucus members, provincial governments and activists opposed to pipelines. Absolutists such as the Green Party’s Elizabeth May will put their foot down and fulminate: “This shall not pass!” But more persuadable actors will see that carbon capture means all sides of the question are being attended to. We columnists generally prefer politicians who do exactly what we recommend and simply tell their opponents: “Sorry, you lose!” Steamrolling is sometimes unavoidable and occasionally works. But logic and history both suggest that politicians who can find ways to share the gains from a policy that improves things will do better. Carney will be telling his B.C. caucus, who are saying “Not on our West Coast!”, and Quebecers, who are fat and happy with all their hydro power, that if the federation is to succeed, Ottawa can’t just keep saying “No, you lose again” to Alberta. It’s a strong message on its own but in delivering it to carbon-worriers, it probably helps if he can give them a mollifier. - William Watson: Does Carney’s 'round the world every 44 days' really help Canada? - William Watson: Real-time budget spreadsheets reveal a lot - Advertisement 1Story continues below Economics says that instead of building elaborate, expensive infrastructure it would be more efficient to just give maybe half its cost in cash to pipeline opponents to persuade them to chill. But our politics frowns on naked cash bribes so build we probably will. If Carney’s agility gets him through that political deal, a bigger one awaits: making the domestic political concessions that renegotiating CUSMA will require. The Wall Street Journal’s indispensable Americas columnist Mary Anastasia O’Grady wrote this week about how even in Trump’s Washington it might yet be possible to save North American free trade. “The trade deal with Mexico and Canada works well,” her sub-head read, “but there are problems to fix.” As evidence it does work she cited submissions by major U.S. industry organizations to the U.S. Trade Representative in response to his legally-required pre-renegotiation request for comments on how the deal is working. More than 1500 were received, some running to dozens of pages. Sample passages are cited in a Nota Bene published today in FP Comment. After a year of ever-deepening pessimism on the trade front, it is heartening to read comments from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and others explaining in detail just how good a deal North American free trade is for the U.S. and how it helps achieve Trump’s goal of keeping U.S. manufacturing internationally competitive (see Nota Bene below). As the Chamber of Commerce says, yes, if it wanted to, the U.S. could produce all its own aluminum instead of importing from Canada, but achieving self-sufficiency “would take decades, cost tens of billions of dollars, and require additional electricity production equivalent to that of the state of Nevada.” The submissions O’Grady cites are impressive. Washington lobbyists clearly know what they’re doing, which is not surprising, given all the money involved. Playing to the president’s vanity, their stories are all about how great the Trump USMCA is for America’s strategic economic goals. OK, a Canadian is likely to react. Whatever works. But even a friend of free trade like Mary Anastasia O’Grady also says next year’s negotiations will have to address “glaring holes” in the current agreement. What’s the first Canadian irritant she mentions? “Canada’s dairy subsidies remain a sore spot for the U.S. and Mexico …” On CUSMA, Donald Trump’s lack of attention to detail will work in our favour. He doesn’t know the much longer list of trade irritants the State Department tracks. But he does know dairy. And Canada-U.S. free trade isn’t going to survive without Canadian concessions on dairy. That means we’re going to need an internal political deal. We’ll never bring dairy farmers on board. They’re like Elizabeth May on pipelines: they only know “No!” But an artful politician will need to persuade people with more open minds that we’ll be as fair as possible to dairy farmers but they can’t continue to hold the rest of our economy hostage. If Mark Carney is agile enough to do that, all sorts of people may surprise themselves by voting for him. Nota Bene: Some important Americans still like free trade The Office of the United States Trade Representative is asking for public comment on the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA or USMCA, as it is known in the U.S.) in preparation for its renegotiation next year. So far, 1,515 submissions have been received. Here are excerpts from three: Many of these new (2025) tariffs have been applied under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, under which tariffs are imposed on imports that “threaten to impair the national security; on the contrary, these duties impose a heavy burden on U.S. manufacturing and consumers, notably imposing significant costs on the U.S. auto manufacturing sector, the nation’s largest manufacturing subsector … It is not reasonable to claim that imports of these goods from a close ally somehow pose a threat to U.S. national security when these imports are essential to the competitiveness of U.S. industry. The U.S. tariff on Canadian aluminum is a vivid case in point: Replacing Canadian aluminum with domestic production — as is the apparent objective of the present 50 per cent tariff — would take decades, cost tens of billions of dollars, and require additional electricity production equivalent to that of the state of Nevada … The USMCA has provided substantial benefits to American workers, farmers, ranchers, and companies across the breadth of the U.S. economy. More than 13 million American jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico, and the agreement has fostered U.S. economic growth in ways that support many additional high-wage jobs. U.S. manufacturers export more made-in-America manufactured goods to our North American neighbours than they do to the next 12 largest export markets combined, and the two countries purchase one-third of all U.S. agricultural exports. — U.S. Chamber of Commerce The U.S. aerospace industry and the Trump administration share the same objectives: advance aviation safety, grow U.S. jobs, expand U.S. manufacturing, and ensure American companies are engaged in reciprocal trade, with fair access to foreign markets. There is no better example for the Trump administration’s vision for the American production economy than the U.S. aerospace industry. The zero-tariff regime that has been in place since 1980 has provided robust economic growth, as well as ensured a safe and secure supply chain for the aviation industry. The U.S. aerospace industry has achieved these objectives … The USMCA has supported the strength of the North American supply chain and has continued to facilitate significant aerospace investment in the United States, providing a stable framework for manufacturers and trade flows within North America. In turn, this supply chain has helped to ensure that the United States remains at the pinnacle of the global aerospace value chain in both design authority and as final exporter. GAMA supports the Trump administration’s continued ambition to support and expand U.S. manufacturing, including in the aerospace sector … GAMA believes that a zero-tariff environment is the best way to maintain the U.S. aerospace sector’s competitive position and urges the administration to focus on implementing a reciprocal zero-tariff regime with Canada and Mexico in the USMCA … — General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) The administration has rightly pursued a comprehensive manufacturing strategy. Implementing the president’s tax reforms, unblocking permitting approvals, rebalancing regulations and making investments in the American manufacturing workforce are all vital to achieving a renaissance in American manufacturing. The USMCA, as negotiated and ratified during the first Trump administration, not only supports manufacturing at home and for the North American market, it is also a core driver of the global competitiveness of manufacturers in the U.S. … The USMCA is the most pro-manufacturing trade agreement in history. Through complementary cross-border commercial relationships and investments, U.S.-based manufacturers leverage unique and complementary regional assets to effectively outcompete all other major economies, including China. In the face of geopolitical instability, the drive to win the technological race, the imperative of energy dominance, workforce challenges and other headwinds, the enduring advantage of geography persists. By utilizing the opportunity of the USMCA, manufacturers structure their operations to maximize U.S. strengths in R&D, product development and process innovation and increase productivity and returns … Mexico and Canada are major sources of intermediate goods and capital equipment for manufacturing in the U.S. Seventy-two per cent of imports from Canada and 63 per cent of imports from Mexico are industrial materials, parts and components that go into further manufacturing in the U.S. and the machinery and equipment installed in American factories. These inputs are crucial to manufacturers’ ability to make things in the U.S. …The value of imports of manufacturing inputs from North America is now three times greater than from China. … In grappling with geopolitical risks and the mounting impacts of nonmarket unfair trade practices, manufacturers prioritize security and reliability of supplier networks over low-cost considerations. With partners in Mexico and Canada, cross-border trade achieves these long-term security benefits while also shortening supply chains. — National Association of Manufacturers Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Markets, rejoice! The U.S. government shutdown, the longest in history, has finally come to an end. An optimist might assume the funding deal will avert a similar crisis—perhaps until the next administration, or for a couple of years at least? Not so. The countdown is already on, and the clock is set to 78 days. Last night, President Donald Trump signed a funding bill to end the 43-day impasse on Capitol Hill. In it were funding provisions for departments including SNAP food aid, the Department of Agriculture, Congress, and veterans affairs through September next year. Unfortunately, the vast majority of federal departments only had their budgets approved until January 30. While Wall Street rarely misses a step because of Washington’s fiscal fisticuffs, the longer the shutdown, the greater its potential to have an adverse effect on the economy. Some flights were grounded after Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) staff went unpaid during the shutdown, while furloughed workers more widely pulled back on spending as they wondered when they would next receive a paycheck. The issue investors may have focused on most was the void of data during the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics could not provide its hotly-anticipated jobs market reports, adding to fears that the employment market may be slowing at an increasingly faster rate. Similarly, inflation data went unreleased. This means that concerns over tariff-induced price rises (or retailers sneaking up their price tags in a data blackout) may have trickled through unnoticed, leading to a reckoning further down the line. The combination of no inflation and no labor data also presents a specific problem for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets the base rate precisely on the metrics of inflation at 2% and full and stable employment levels. The Fed flying blind on a market-altering decision added to a sense of unease about what’s been happening in the real economy while Washington argued with itself. The reprieve from such uncertainty may not last long. As Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid highlighted to clients Thursday morning: “We could be on the verge of another shutdown in just over 10 weeks’ time, not least if tensions over health care subsidies that Democrats had pushed for escalate between now and then. But for now, the end of the shutdown has boosted the market mood.” Markets are relatively flat this morning. Before the bell in New York, the S&P 500 posted marginal gains yesterday while the Dow Jones increased 0.68%. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 posted minor losses. In early trading in Europe, Germany’s DAX and the FTSE 100 both declined by 0.4%, while France’s CAC 40 posted a marginal gain of 0.69%. In Asia, markets were buoyant: the Nikkei 225 rose 0.43%, the Shanghai Stock Exchange increased by 0.73%, and the Hang Seng Index advanced 0.56%. Setting the tone for January In signing the deal, President Trump also set the tone for future negotiations: “We’re sending a clear message that we will never give in to extortion,” he said. At the same time, the White House confirmed economic data for October may never be released. “All of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed, flying blind at a critical period,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. Alternative assets are likely to trade well in a period of volatility, noted UBS. In a note to clients on Monday, the financial giant wrote: “Political uncertainty should continue to support gold.” It explained: “Partial shutdown remains a possibility after 30 January if Congress does not pass another continuing resolution or make progress on funding for other federal departments. Additionally, uncertainty around the Supreme Court’s ruling over the legality of tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) should provide ongoing support for gold.” Here’s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning: - S&P 500 futures are down fractionally by 0.021%. - STOXX Europe 600 was up a touch by 0.079% in early trading. - The U.K.’s FTSE 100 is down 0.40%. - Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.43%. - China’s CSI 300 is up 1.21%. - India’s NIFTY 50 is flat. - Bitcoin is at $103K.",right
"President Donald Trump's proposed $2,000 tariff dividend check has already bagged all the headlines but what this could mean for the eligible Americans. That's the major question -- who will receive Trump's $2,000 tariff dividend check? While White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt didn't divulge too many details, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has revealed a possible income cut off for the social security measure. According to USA Today report, Bessent suggested $100,000 as the income cut off for Americans to receive Trump's $2,000 tariff dividend check. Pew Research Center’s 2025 report shows that middle-class Americans have average income from $41,392 to $124,176, according to U.S News. One of Trump's most eye-catching suggestions came on social media over the weekend as he proposed dividends of $2,000 for each American, funded by the sweeping tariffs he has imposed around the world. The scheme is reminiscent of the Trump-branded stimulus checks he sent out during the Covid pandemic, but economic figures suggest that it may be a while before any tariff dividend checks arrive in the mail. Trump said tariffs were bringing in ""trillions of dollars,"" but US Treasury Department data showed customs revenues -- which includes tariffs -- rose by $179 billion in the January to September period of this year. The US Supreme Court is meanwhile examining whether the levies are even legal. Trump's spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt insisted that the White House was 'committed' to the dividends and exploring legal options, but said there was ""no timeline"" for Trump's scheme. Q1.

"Elon Musk’s Tesla will exclude China-made components from its cars manufactured in the United States. The move is designed to address escalating trade tensions and geopolitical risks The Wall Street Journal reports that Elon Musk’s Tesla is taking decisive steps to reduce its reliance on Chinese suppliers for its U.S.-made vehicles. The company has mandated that its suppliers exclude China-made components in the manufacturing of Tesla cars in the United States, according to people familiar with the situation. This move comes as a response to the deepening geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. The electric car maker has already started replacing some China-made components with parts manufactured elsewhere, in collaboration with its suppliers. Tesla aims to completely transition to non-Chinese components for its U.S. production within the next one to two years. This accelerated strategy was triggered by President Trump’s imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese imports, making it imperative for the company to minimize its exposure to the uncertainties of the U.S.-China trade war. China has been a major producer and exporter of auto parts, including chips, batteries, and materials used in car manufacturing. The country’s massive production scale, lower costs, and weak currency have made Chinese components more affordable for automakers. However, the fluctuating tariff levels resulting from the trade dispute have made it challenging for Tesla to develop a consistent pricing strategy. The recent geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing have further intensified Tesla’s urgency to pursue a China-free supply chain. Fresh disruptions in the supply of automotive chips, stemming from a dispute between China and the Netherlands, have prompted discussions within Tesla about the need to accelerate diversification efforts. Tesla’s strategy to exclude China-made components is the latest example of how trade and geopolitical tensions are driving a decoupling of the world’s two largest economies and reshaping global supply chains. Many American companies are seeking to reduce their reliance on China-made components or manufacture outside of China for products destined for the U.S. market. Similarly, Chinese technology companies are removing American components and technology from their supply chains. While Tesla produces cars at its Shanghai plant using mostly locally sourced components, the vehicles manufactured there are shipped within China and to other markets in Asia and Europe, but not to the United States. Over the years, Chinese suppliers that Tesla has been working with in China have increasingly been shipping parts globally for the carmaker’s factories elsewhere. To support its strategy of reducing reliance on Chinese components, Tesla has been working with its Chinese suppliers to set up factories and warehouses in Mexico and Southeast Asia. However, finding a substitute for the lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery, supplied by China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), remains a challenge. Tesla has stopped selling cars with Chinese-produced LFP batteries in the U.S. due to tariffs and ineligibility for EV-related tax credits. The move by Tesla to eliminate China from its supply chain is particularly interesting given that Musk maintains a tight relationship with the country’s communist dictatorship. Chinese state media was quick to defend Musk when he clashed with the Trump administration this summer over the “Big Beautiful Bill” as Breitbart News previously reported: Lü Xiang, a research fellow often quoted in the pages of the state-run newspaper, described cooperation between Trump and Musk as “inconceivable” from the beginning, “considering they have opposite views and interests in regard to EVs and clean energy industry.” “According to Lü, the bill will not only affect Musk’s EV giant, but signals a major veering of US energy policy: touting US fossil fuels while suppressing its own clean energy sectors,” the Times noted, paraphrasing Lü as stating that passing the bill would “not only have an impact on America’s own energy transition, but also, considering the US’ global influence, deal a blow to international carbon cut and climate response efforts.” Read more at the Wall Street Journal here.

"Underwhelmed and unimpressed are how shoppers are feeling about Black Friday deals so far. The Repasky family makes a tradition of coming out to Tysons Corner Center shopping mall in Virginia on Black Friday. One change they noticed this year: fewer doorbuster deals and freebies. Jennifer Schmuck reported the same from Westfield Montgomery Mall in Maryland Friday morning. “I don’t think the deals were as good,” the 50-year-old banker said. Last year Macy’s Inc. gave her a $10 coupon for being among the first in line, but didn’t this year. Near Philadelphia, Melissa Ritzius, a 50-year-old homemaker, was similarly unimpressed with the sales at the Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Store. Even though the deals looked comparable to last year, with higher listed price they didn’t amount to much of a discount. One Polo sweater she was eyeing went from $125 last year to $170 this year. “It’s a big change,” she said. Ritzius didn’t end up buying it. Many shoppers said they came out for the experience of big crowds, yet that too was disappointing for some. Some malls and shopping centers across the US today, like Patrick Henry Mall in Virginia, were empty this morning. Others had lines at a few stores, like Macy’s, Old Navy, Target and Edikted. “It feels like less than a normal Saturday,” said Nicole Slaughter from the Mall of Georgia in the Atlanta area. Deontay Phillips, a 26-year-old who serves in the military, who came out for his first Black Friday was underwhelmed by the lack of deals and festivities. “It’s not really what I expected,” said Phillips from a Best Buy Co. store in Newport News, Virginia. “I probably won’t do this again.” US consumers are heading into the official start of the holiday shopping season Friday with a host of economic concerns, including a cooling job market, stagnant wages, persistent inflation and the looming fallout from tariffs. Black Friday will be a litmus test: Will American shoppers push through growing economic headwinds or will the consumer-powered US economy start to fizzle? Signs point to a less indulgent holiday season. “We are not expecting it to be an overzealous, exciting holiday,” said Marshal Cohen, chief retail adviser at research firm Circana. While overall spending is estimated to be on par with last year, according to Circana, unit sales could fall as much as 2.5%. In other words: People will spend more to buy less stuff. “The tree is not going to be jammed this year,” Cohen said. US retailers generate 20% of their annual sales in November and December. This year, companies are competing for an increasingly price-sensitive and anxious consumer. While people are still willing to spend — particularly those in the top 10% of earners — they’re being picky about where they put their dollars. Some shoppers say they’re planning on taking advantage of Black Friday sales not to splurge, but to stock up on essentials. Tariffs, meanwhile, are making it harder for some brands to offer the big discounts usually associated with Black Friday. And shoppers who venture to stores may encounter longer lines and less help. Seasonal retail hiring is expected to fall to its lowest level since 2009. “Nothing is discounted enough that it moves the needle where I’m like, ‘oh I don’t need it, but I need to get it now,’” said Jennifer Greenberg, a 29-year-old who lives in New York City, while shopping for a menorah at Bloomingdale’s. Still, the day won’t be entirely devoid of promotions. Walmart Inc. is offering discounts on a range of items including 50% off Vizio TVs and a puffer jacket for just $10. Amazon.com Inc. has discounts of up to 50% on beauty products from Lancôme and luxury fragrances from other brands. Target Corp. is offering nearly half off SodaStream machines and up to $200 off on Apple products, in addition to $1 bow ornaments, $5 Barbie fashionista dolls and $10 throws. At Home Depot Inc., some power tools and refrigerators will be 50% off. Kohl’s plans to be “highly” promotional this holiday season to win over stressed shoppers. Best Buy is predicting a stronger Black Friday than in years past. Stores are also hoping to draw shoppers in other ways. Target was planning to give away free gift bags to the first 100 customers at every store on Black Friday and will offer exclusive Wicked-themed items and frozen peppermint hot chocolates at the Starbucks locations in its stores. Abercrombie & Fitch Inc.’s Hollister is teaming up with Taco Bell to sell limited-edition merch that will debut on Cyber Monday. Walmart and Target are rolling out a new AI-driven shopping tools to help customers find deals and make purchases more easily. Consumer spending has held relatively steady this year despite macroeconomic turbulence. Earlier in the year, some shoppers fueled sales with big ticket items they purchased to avoid impending tariffs. Since then, a buoyant stock market has kept people in the top income brackets spending. Many retailers have said that people’s purchasing habits remain consistent and that tariffs haven’t affected prices as much as initially expected. More recently, however, gloomy signals have started to emerge. Lower-income consumers are pulling back their spending, while US consumer confidence slid in November by the most in seven months. Retail sales growth slowed in September. Shoppers are likely to gravitate to items that could be hit by tariffs next year, said Jessica Ramírez, managing director at the Consumer Collective consulting firm. People are also purchasing things that bring them joy during an otherwise stressful time, she said. That includes keychains and other accessories to spruce up their handbags and home decor items to brighten up their living space. In recent years, Black Friday has become less of an event as more shoppers take advantage of fall and online sales, like Amazon’s Prime Day, to get an early start on holiday shopping. That trend is even more pronounced this year, due to tariff fears, said Michael Brown, the Americas retail leader at strategy firm Kearney. That could weigh on overall spending during the next two months, he said.",right
"Costco has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of International Trade seeking to preserve its right to a refund of tariffs paid under President Donald Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The warehouse club chain filed the complaint Nov. 28, joining dozens of other companies that have brought similar cases in recent weeks as the Supreme Court weighs the legality of Trump’s tariff program. The lawsuit aims to ensure Costco remains eligible for refunds if the high court ultimately rules against the tariffs. The company said Customs and Border Protection denied its request to extend deadlines for finalizing tariff determinations, which could jeopardize its ability to seek full refunds later. Costco did not specify in the filing how much it has paid in tariffs under IEEPA. The company has previously said about a third of its U.S. sales are imported products, with items from China representing roughly 8% of total U.S. sales. The Supreme Court heard arguments on Trump’s tariffs Nov. 5 and placed the case on an expedited schedule, though the justices have not indicated when they will rule. Other major companies that have filed similar protective lawsuits include Revlon, Kawasaki Motors, and EssilorLuxottica. COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Canada adds surprise 67,000 jobs in October, unemployment rate drops to 6.9% OTTAWA — Canada’s labour market caught economists off guard with a second straight month of surprise job gains in October. Statistics Canada said Friday the economy added 67,000 jobs in October, good enough to drive the unemployment rate down two tenths of a percentage point to 6.9 per cent. October’s growth was driven by part-time work with 85,000 positions added, coming off solid gains in full-time work in September. The private sector meanwhile added 73,000 jobs for its first gain since June. Economists polled by Reuters ahead of Friday’s release expected Canada’s labour market would take a breather with a loss of 2,500 jobs in October, following a surprise gain of 60,000 positions in September. Job gains across October and September now more than offset sharp drops observed in August and July. The wholesale and retail trade sector saw the most growth with 41,000 positions added in October, followed by transportation and warehousing with 30,000 jobs and the information, culture and recreation sector with 25,000 roles. Tariff-sensitive manufacturing posted a gain of 8,700 positions in October while construction lost 15,000 jobs. StatCan said goods-producing industries have shed 54,000 positions on net since January — when uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs and global trade started to ramp up — while the services side of the economy had added 142,000 jobs over that time. Ontario, a province hit hard by the trade war, led job growth provincially with 55,000 positions added for its first gain since June. Manufacturing-heavy Windsor’s unemployment rate peaked at 11.2 per cent in June but has since trended down to 9.6 per cent, according to three-month moving averages. Young workers saw some relief in October after struggling for months in a tough labour market as youth aged 15 to 24 saw 21,000 jobs added last month, the first gain since January. That drove the youth jobless rate down 0.6 percentage points to 14.1 per cent in October after reaching a 15-year high in September, outside the pandemic. Average hourly wages were up 3.5 per cent annually in October, accelerating from 3.3 per cent the month before. The Bank of Canada will be parsing labour data closely as it prepares for its final interest rate decision of the year on Dec. 10, though the central bank will also get a look at November’s jobs figures before making that call. The bank’s benchmark interest rate stands at 2.25 per cent following a pair of consecutive cuts. Governor Tiff Macklem signalled last month that the central bank may be satisfied with where the benchmark interest rate stands unless incoming economic data strays from its forecasts.

"Figures from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) show that India shipped 4,319 tonnes of goods to the US between January and June 2025, a sharp decline from 7,152 tonnes during the same period last year. Even at the height of the pandemic, freight volumes stayed between 5,000 and 9,000 tonnes, the data revealed. The last comparable dip occurred in 2016, when the figures hit 3,750 tonnes. Industry experts say the tariff surge has crippled demand and forced exporters to shrink order sizes drastically. Members of the Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations in India (FFFAI) noted that exporters are struggling to stay afloat amid higher costs and reduced buyer interest. “When Trump took office, tariff rates initially rose by 25%. It later shot up by 50%, severely affecting key export segments. Handicrafts, one of India’s major exports to the US, have taken a severe beating,” said Rajesh Verma, vice-chairman of FFFAI, in comments to TOI. A Punjab-based trader told the publication that he has been forced to cut daily shipments of engineering tools from 30 orders to around 10-12, with “just a handful of buyers willing to purchase increasingly expensive goods.” Dealers in gems and jewellery, textiles, readymade apparel, and perishable goods—which make up a major portion of India’s air freight to the US—have been among the hardest hit. “Although pharmaceuticals have largely been spared for now, products like garments, diamonds, and engineering tools have been hit hard. Products that cost $100 earlier are now priced at approximately $150. Additional restrictions imposed by US authorities have slowed clearances and affected trade volumes,” said S. Anil Kumar, president of the Hyderabad Customs Brokers’ Association, as quoted by TOI.

"Nvidia stock was down 2.59% yesterday, and it’s now down 7% for the month. The negativity continued this morning: The company’s shares were down a further 1.34% overnight, mostly on news that Meta was considering using Google’s chips to power its AI models. Normally, given the excess valuations that the Magnificent Seven tech companies carry, this would be a disaster for stocks. But this morning, traders are ignoring Nvidia and a global rally in stocks is underway. S&P 500 futures were up 0.29% this morning, premarket, after the index closed up 0.91% yesterday. Markets in Asia and Europe were up across the board. Perhaps most interestingly, tech stocks that aren’t Nvidia are also holding their own—the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.58% yesterday. Jim Reid and his team at Deutsche Bank described the buoyant mood like this: “The three-day advance for the S&P since Thursday’s low stands at +3.47%, which is the strongest three-day move since the U.S.-China tariff reduction back in May and leaves the index less than 2% from its all-time high. The U.S. equity advance was broad-based, with the small-cap Russell 2000 up +2.14% and the equal-weighted S&P 500 up +1.45% on the day.” Why the good cheer? Five main factors: First, companies in the S&P are actually doing quite well. With 95% of them having reported Q3 results: “Earnings per share (EPS) growth is tracking over 13% … cruising past the 7.4% consensus forecast,” according to LPL Financial analysts Jeffrey Buchbinder, Adam Turnquist, and Brian Booe. “S&P 500 revenue grew 8.4%, an atypically strong 2.5% above expectations at quarter-end.” That good fortune is reflected in the private markets, too. Lincoln International—which tracks the private credit market—told Fortune that 68% of companies in its database grew their revenue over the preceding 12 months, and 62% grew their adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda). Revenue was up an average of 6.5% in the 12 months through Q3 2025; Ebitda was up 5.4%. The VIX “fear” index, which measures volatility, has declined 23.08% over the past five days, suggesting that stock investors have stopped being scared that an AI bubble will derail market momentum. JPMorgan set a new target for the S&P for the end of 2026: 7,500, projecting “above-trend earnings growth of 13% to 15% for at least the next two years,” Dubravko Lakos-Bujas and his team told clients this morning. And finally, it’s looking more and more likely that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again in December, delivering a new round of cheaper money, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which currently rates the possibility of a cut at 84%. Nvidia, in other words, is a fly in the market’s soup, but the soup still tastes pretty good. (Don’t cry too many tears for Nvidia investors, by the way, its stock is still up 32.41% year to date.) Here’s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning: - S&P 500 futures were up 0.29% this morning. The last session closed up 0.91%. - The STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.45% in early trading. - The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.25% in early trading. - Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 1.85%. - China’s CSI 300 was up 0.61%. - The South Korea KOSPI was up 2.67%. - India’s Nifty 50 is up 1.24%. - Bitcoin was at $86K.",right
"Global Stock Leaderboards Are Ruled by Europe in Rare Dominance In the ranks of the world’s 20 best-performing stock markets this year, every second index is European. (Bloomberg) — In the ranks of the world’s 20 best-performing stock markets this year, every second index is European. It’s an achievement the region has managed only three times before and is a testament of revived investor confidence in Europe, where growth prospects have finally been improving. It also came as a surprise, as most strategists had predicted the year would bring meager gains while the US economy was set to fuel superior performance on Wall Street. With a month left of trading for 2025, markets including Hungary, Slovenia and the Czech Republic have rallied more than 60% in dollar terms. That places them among the top 10 best performers globally. Spain, Poland and Austria are close behind, while Germany — one of the region’s biggest markets — has surged 20% in euros and 34% in dollar terms. As the broader Stoxx 600 Index closes in on its biggest outperformance over the S&P 500 since 2006 in dollars, some investors say the outlook for Europe is only looking up. Inflation remains lower than in America, Germany is about to open the fiscal taps and corporate earnings are projected to rebound. The latest monthly survey by Bank of America Corp. showed investors are now net overweight European stocks, while being slightly underweight US equities. “At the beginning of the year, people were very reluctant about the rally in Europe, and they got forced into that based on the outperformance,” said Nick Laux, head of international equity trading at Bank of America Corp., adding that there’s scope for the region to outperform further next year. In a year rocked by President Donald Trump’s trade war, European countries that make most of their money at home such as Italy and Spain have proved to be investors’ favorites. The region’s relatively lower exposure to the artificial intelligence trade has also been a big draw at a time when there are mounting concerns about another US technology bubble. Overall, 10 of the top 20 markets to have risen the most this year are in Europe, a feat only achieved in 2004, 2015 and 2023 in data going back to the creation of the euro area. While benchmarks in Germany and France are lower on the list at 34 and 53, respectively, they’re still well ahead of the S&P 500, which ranks 63rd in dollar terms among 92 global indexes tracked by Bloomberg. Part of the outperformance is down to a stronger euro. The currency has rallied 12% against the greenback this year as Germany promised to spend billions on defense and infrastructure, reviving the local economy. German lawmakers are set to approve in the coming days spending €2.9 billion ($3.4 billion) on military procurement contracts, including for drones, rifles and missiles, in deals that will go largely to domestic manufacturers, Bloomberg reported on Friday. Inflation is also back within a targeted range, allowing the European Central Bank to lower interest rates faster than the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, the dollar has slumped as Trump’s historic tariffs fueled worries about the end of so-called American exceptionalism. Strong Showing That’s not to say US stocks have had a bad year. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 16% in 2025, tracking a third straight year of double-digit gains. And while there are some concerns about the tech rally running too hot, investors are broadly confident that the economic outlook remains resilient. Still, European indexes have managed to hold their own even when measured in local currencies, driven by sectors such as banking, defense and renewables. “Europe is in a very nice place at the moment,” said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. “Whenever there are doubts about the US rally, Europe is here to protect you because basically it’s not loaded with tech.” European banking stocks have been at the forefront of the rally with gains of 67%, and investors are betting they’ll continue to shine on the back of robust earnings, a pick up in M&A activity and the outlook for stable interest rates. Shares in defense stocks including Rheinmetall AG and Leonardo SpA have also surged in anticipation of higher military spending for years to come, while renewable stocks have jumped on strong demand to power AI infrastructure. Things are also looking up for the key luxury sector, with heavyweights such as LVMH signaling a rebound in consumer demand after several quarters of malaise. Meanwhile, rising demand for metals in the energy transition and tight supplies have turned Europe’s mining stocks into a “must-hold,” and even the defensive health care sector is starting to attract investors as easing concerns over drug pricing and tariff risks complement tempting valuations. Earnings Boost Analysts expect European earnings growth can finally close the gap with the US after lagging behind since 2023. Stoxx 600 firms are expected to post an 11% jump in profits next year, while S&P 500 earnings are projected to increase by 13% in 2026, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. However, some market participants said optimism about Europe may have gone too far. There’s the threat from lingering political uncertainty in France, questions around the impact of German stimulus and rising competition from China in key industries such as consumer goods and automakers. “European stocks face a high risk on earnings expectations next year,” said Marina Zavolock, chief European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. “We think analyst projections are too elevated and there is high potential for downgrades.” Valuation Appeal The good news for European stocks is that they remain relatively cheap even after this year’s rally. The Stoxx 600 trades at a 35% discount to the S&P 500 based on forward price to earnings ratios. This means that even a small rise in earnings after near zero growth in 2025 could be enough to carry the market to fresh peaks. Money flows also suggest investors remain optimistic. European equity funds drew about $52 billion this year, a stark reversal from outflows of $66 billion last year, according to figures from Bank of America, citing EPFR Global. “In January, there will be some allocation to markets outside the US,” said BofA’s Laux. “But then beyond that it will all depend on the performance. If Europe can demonstrate compelling performance, then the money will come.” Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI: Indian spice merchants and tea growers will be among global exporters who will breathe easy along with American consumers after US president Donald Trump, feeling the heat of rising domestic prices due to tariffs, moved to lower import duties on nearly 200 food, farm, and agricultural items. Tucked deep in the list is a range of spices, including black pepper, cloves, cumin, cardamom, turmeric, ginger, varieties of tea, mango derivatives, and some nuts, including cashew, all of which India exports to the US.

As Americans go bananas over tariffs, Trump smells the coffee, eases import duties; relief for Indian tea and spices Trump's duty waiver gives major boost to India's key agri exports Indian spice exports to the US were valued at more than $500 million in 2024, and the US imported tea and coffee from India worth nearly $83 million in the same period. The US also imported $843 million worth of fresh or dried cashew nuts - which also got a break - from across the world, with India accounting for around 20% of the imports. Not making the cut, however, are Indian seafoods, including shrimp, and basmati rice, which are multi-billion dollar exports from India to the US. Indian gems, jewellery, and apparel, too, remain under 50% US tariff sanctions, pending a trade deal that Trump has said will happen once New Delhi turns off the Russian oil spigot and steps up buying US energy. Effectively, the exemptions apply only to little over $1 billion in qualifying agricultural exports from India. Indian govt officials said in New Delhi that 50 processed food products, whose exports were estimated at $491 million last year, including coffee and tea extracts, cocoa preparations, juices, fruit pulps, mango-based products and vegetable waxes, will be the top gainers. Next will be spices, whose exports were pegged at $359 million last year. They said that 48 fruits and nuts, such as coconuts, guavas, mangoes, cashew nuts, bananas, areca nuts, and pineapples, also stand to benefit although the value of these exports was around $55 million. This amounts to nearly a fifth of India's agricultural exports, estimated at $5.7 billion. Exempted products were estimated at around 40% of India's goods exports of $86 billion last year.

Our products are well-placed to gain due to existing supplier credibility, established distribution networks, and strong diaspora-driven demand - factors that provide a competitive edge in the US,"" said an Indian govt official. Trump's rollback, announced through an executive order he signed on Friday, comes amid growing disquiet across the country over the cost of living, reflected in voter dissatisfaction that led to a GOP rout in byelections at the hands of Democrats who campaigned on the ""affordability"" message. The US president has also floated the idea of using tariff revenue to issue $2,000 rebate checks to Americans and launched a probe into the meat packing industry following Americans' beef over high prices.

The US president and his followers are accused of being tone deaf to cost-of-living issues, prompting one wag to remark: ""My budget and my reality are not on speaking terms anymore."" The subject became a lightning rod for criticism after Trump hosted a Gatsby-themed Halloween party at his Mar-a-Lago estate and embarked on building an extravagant ballroom bigger than the White House it will be attached to - all the while preening about what critics describe as a gilded Oval Office now garishly overlaid with gold curios and accents.",right
"India, Canada deepen energy, mineral ties amid U.S. tariffs The two nations will also widen aerospace investment and trading opportunities India and Canada will work together to secure supply chains in critical minerals and clean energy, according to a joint statement, signalling a reset in bilateral ties amid trade tensions driven by U.S. policies. The two nations will also deepen engagement to widen investment and trading opportunities in the aerospace sector, the statement issued Friday said. Relations between the two countries have been rocky since 2023, when then-prime minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused India of killing a Sikh separatist leader outside a temple in Surrey, B.C. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government denied involvement and blamed Canada for harbouring Sikh separatist groups, resulting in a pause in trade talks. However, United States President Donald Trump’s trade policies have pushed the nations to revisit their positions as countries across the globe scramble to diversify supply chains and find new markets to shield their economies from Washington’s tariff onslaught. Trump singled out India for purchasing Russian oil and imposed a crushing tariff of 50 per cent that hit more than half of Indian exports to the U.S. The U.S. halted all trade talks with Canada in late October over a Canadian advertisement against Trump’s tariff policy. After Mark Carney became Canada’s prime minister, the two countries have taken a series of steps in repairing ties, including restoring their envoys and seeking to establish a information-sharing framework to curb cross-border crime. Earlier this week, Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met his counterpart, Anita Anand, in Ontario while Canadian Trade Minister Maninder Sidhu is visiting India. Bilateral trade in goods and services stood at US$23.66 billion in 2024, with merchandise trade valued at nearly US$8.98 billion, a substantial 10 per cent increase over the previous year, according to the statement.

"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said President Donald Trump’s proposal to send $2,000 “dividend” payments from tariffs to US citizens would require congressional approval. “We will see,” Bessent said on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures. “We need legislation for that.” Trump, who has touted the billions raised in US tariff revenue this year, has talked about the checks as public frustration mounts over the cost of living. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Friday, Trump said the checks would go out sometime next year to “everybody but the rich.” “It’s a lot of money,” he said. “But we’ve taken in a lot of money from tariffs. The tariffs allow us to give a dividend.” He added that “we’re also going to be reducing debt.” Read More: Trump’s $2,000 Tariff ‘Dividend’ Marks Throwback to Covid Checks The plan could cost the US government double what it’s projected to take in for 2025, according to one estimate. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a centrist watchdog group, estimated a preliminary $600 billion cost for the proposal, if the dividends were designed along the lines of government stimulus payments during the Covid pandemic. Net US tariff revenue for the fiscal year through September totaled $195 billion and many economists have penciled in about $300 billion for calendar-year 2025. Bessent said Americans should start feeling more economic relief in the beginning of next year, citing the tax cuts in Trump’s signature policy bill passed earlier this year. “So I would expect in the first two quarters we are going to see the inflation curve bend down and the real income curve substantially accelerate,” he said.",right
"The tariffs that President Donald Trump rolled back this past week will barely move the needle on consumer inflation, but his retreat potentially signals a major shift, according to a Wall Street analyst. On Friday, Trump said he will scrap tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and a range of other commodities, even after insisting that his duties haven’t raised prices. That followed off-year elections that delivered stunning defeats to Republicans as voters protested the high cost of living. Given that imported food makes up just 10% of what U.S. households consume, the tariff rollback’s impact on inflation is a “practically a rounding error,” wrote Bernard Yaros, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note on Friday. But they will have outsized effects beyond the economic data. “Food prices also weigh heavily on consumers’ inflation psychology, not to mention their sentiment,” he explained. “Of all major food categories, consumer sentiment is historically most sensitive to the price of meats, poultry, and eggs, followed by cereals.” Indeed, sticker shock at the grocery store has fueled demands for more affordability, which was a central issue in the recent elections. Despite consumer inflation cooling sharply from 9% in 2022, prices are still ticking up, and tariffs have kept the annual rate sticky—even edging higher since Trump launched his trade war. Voters are now rewarding politicians who promise to freeze certain costs. With both parties already looking ahead to the 2026 midterm elections, Yaros sees Trump providing more tariff relief if his latest move is any indication. “What matters more for the outlook, though, is the signal that this move sends about the directional shift of future tariff adjustments,” he said. “As we near the election, the administration may broaden these tariff exemptions to a wider swathe of food products.” Yaros pointed to other signs of easing tariff pressure, such as Trump’s recent trade deal with Switzerland that will slash the rate to 15% from 39%. Additional agreements with Brazil and India may follow, lowering tariffs on those countries as well. But according to a working paper from San Francisco Fed researchers, Trump may actually want to maintain his tariffs if his goal is to fight inflation. The study examined 150 years of tariffs and concluded that they depress economic activity and employment, resulting in lower inflation. “The inflation response goes against the predictions of standard models, whereby CPI inflation should go up in response to higher tariffs,” researchers Régis Barnichon and Aayush Singh wrote. “Instead, tariff shocks appear to act as aggregate demand shocks—moving inflation and unemployment in the same directions.”",right
"People trying to understand politics in the United States today often turn to history for precedents and perspective. Are our current divisions like the ones that preceded the American Revolution or the Civil War? Did the dramatic events of the 1960s generate the same kind of social and political forces seen today? Are there lessons from the past that show us how eras of intense political turmoil eventually subside? As a scholar of American politics and the presidency, I believe one American historical period is especially worth revisiting in this turbulent moment in the U.S.: the 20 tumultuous years between the presidencies of Ulysses S. Grant and William McKinley in the second half of the 19th century. The two decades between 1876 and 1896 are usually remembered as a time when the cities in the East grew rich and the West was wild – a “Gilded Age” in New York City and gunslingers on the frontier. It was also a time when Americans struggled with immigration issues, racial injustice, tariff levels, technological change, economic volatility and political violence. There was even a president, Grover Cleveland, who served two nonconsecutive terms in the White House – the only time that happened before Donald Trump. In the elections between Grant and McKinley, the nation was closely divided. No president in those years – not Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, Chester Arthur, Cleveland or Benjamin Harrison – served for two consecutive terms. No presidential candidate won more than 50% of the popular vote, except the Democrat Samuel Tilden. And Tilden, after winning 50.1% of the ballots cast in 1876, lost in the Electoral College. That happened again in 1888 when Cleveland, the first time he was seeking a second term, won the popular vote but failed in the Electoral College. The narrow victories that characterized presidential politics in the 1870s and 1880s were matched by constant shifts on Capitol Hill. In the 20 years between Grant and McKinley, there were only six years of unified government, when one political party controlled the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives. In the remaining 14 years, presidents encountered opposition in Congress. The U.S. has the same kind of divided politics today. Heating up partisanship and raising stakes President Bill Clinton had two years of unified government; President George W. Bush had less than that. Barack Obama, Donald Trump in his first term and Joe Biden all came into office with party majorities in the House and Senate, and then, like Clinton, their parties lost the House two years later. Divided politics, with close elections and neither party in power for very long, make partisanship more intense, campaigns harder fought and the stakes sky high whenever voters go to the polls. That’s part of what produced instability in the second half of the 19th century and part of what produces it today. Divided government is, of course, one of the most powerful “checks” in the constitutional system of checks and balances. Intense competition between political parties can prevent the national government from making rash decisions and serious mistakes. It can sometimes generate compromise. But there’s a cost. Political division can also allow critical problems to fester for far too long. The dramatic changes brought on by the Industrial Revolution after the Civil War were not seriously addressed in federal legislation until the Progressive Era early in the 20th century. In the second half of the 19th century, Congress raised or lowered tariffs – depending on which party controlled the White House and Capitol Hill. The nation debated immigration but only once passed meaningful legislation, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. A long list of issues connected to railroads, banks, currency, civil service, corruption and the implementation of the post-Civil War constitutional amendments were ignored or only partially addressed. When major legislation was passed in 1883 to create a merit-based civil service – reforming the spoils system of political appointments – it passed because Garfield’s 1881 assassination by a disgruntled federal job seeker temporarily pushed the issue to the top of the national agenda. Immigration, fake news and riots Political violence accompanied the period of closely divided national elections in the 1870s and 1880s. In the 1880 presidential campaign, both candidates – the Republican, Garfield, and the Democrat, Winfield Hancock – called for restrictions on Chinese immigration to the United States. Neither supported the complete ban that many Westerners wanted. But just before Americans went to the polls, newspapers across the country printed a letter, allegedly written and signed by Garfield, that endorsed an open border to Chinese immigrants. Before anyone could learn that the letter was a fake, there was public uproar. In Denver, an angry mob burned down all the homes in Chinese neighborhoods. There were more incidents of political violence: anti-Chinese riots in Los Angeles in 1871, in San Francisco in 1877 and in Seattle in 1886. Throughout the 1880s, anti-immigrant nativists targeted immigrants from Italy and sometimes vandalized Catholic churches. Political violence in the South successfully suppressed Black voting rights and reestablished white control of state and local politics. Realignment Political division in the second half of the 19th century produced more problems than solutions. How and when did it end, or become less intense? The simple answer is what political scientists call a “realignment,” a major shift in national electoral patterns. In 1893, the first year of Cleveland’s second term, the nation suffered a financial crisis followed by a severe economic depression. As a result, McKinley was able to win solid victories in 1896 and 1900 and build a Republican coalition that dominated presidential politics until the election in 1932 of Democrat Franklin Roosevelt. It’s not hard to imagine how an economic disaster, or a crisis of some kind, could shake the country out of a period of closely divided politics. But that’s a painful way of building a higher level of national unity. Can it happen when large numbers of voters get thoroughly frustrated by languishing issues, swings back and forth in Washington, nasty elections and rising political violence? Perhaps. But either way – responding to crisis or finding a public change of heart – is a reminder that voters are the ultimate arbiters in a functioning democracy. Today, as in late-19th-century America, elections make a difference. They can mark continued division or they can take the nation in a new, and perhaps more unified, direction. Robert A.

"Dorel Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results - Dorel Juvenile delivers resilient third quarter financial results amid market challenges - Dorel Home restructuring on plan - New financing arrangements in place strengthen Company’s financial position MONTRÉAL, Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Dorel Industries Inc. (TSX: DII.B, DII.A) today announced its financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Third quarter revenue was US$298.6 million, compared to US$354.2 million, a decrease of 15.7% from the same period a year ago. Reported net loss was US$47.4 million or US$1.45 per diluted share, compared to US$21.9 million or US$0.67 per diluted share last year. Adjusted net loss1 for 2025 was US$29.8 million or US$0.91 per diluted share as compared to US$20.2 million or US$0.62 per diluted share last year. Revenue for the nine months was US$911.4 million, compared to US$1,053.4 million, a decrease of 13.5% from the prior year. Reported net loss was US$117.6 million or US$3.60 per diluted share, compared to US$99.0 million or US$3.04 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net loss1 for the first nine months of 2025 was US$74.6 million or US$2.28 per diluted share as compared to US$50.7 million or US$1.56 per diluted share a year ago. “The third quarter ended with our significant agreement with new financial partners that will fund our strategic agenda, in accelerating the growth of the Juvenile segment and executing the repositioning of the Home segment. The lack of liquidity prior to these agreements seriously impeded our ability to develop and bring new products to market. This was most acute in the Home segment, but as the quarter progressed it also delayed key product development initiatives in Juvenile, a problem that has now been resolved. This internal challenge was compounded by external pressures, particularly in the U.S. where tariff uncertainty and higher retail price points are creating a slowing retail environment. Despite this, Dorel Juvenile delivered a quarter characterized by stable revenue as strong international performance, led by our European operations, offset softness in the U.S. These results again demonstrated the strength of our global footprint and our commitment to building a more agile and competitive business. Dorel Home progressed on its restructuring plan, including the cessation of manufacturing operations, further workforce and footprint reductions and aggressive inventory liquidation,” stated Dorel President & CEO, Martin Schwartz. ____________________ 1 This is a non-GAAP financial ratio or measure with no standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.

Revenue growth in Europe and International markets like Australia, Canada, and Export, was robust with a total increase of 9.6% in the quarter versus the prior year. This was more than offset by softer sales in the U.S. which was impacted by tariff-related pricing instability and cautious retailer behaviour. Organic revenue1 for the Juvenile segment declined by 3.0%, after removing the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations year-over-year. As in the quarter, year-to-date revenue growth in Europe and International markets offset challenges in the U.S. with total segment year-to-date revenue of US$654.2 million, an increase of US$3.0 million, or 0.5%, from US$651.2 million in 2024. The year-to-date organic revenue1 increase was approximately 0.1%, with International and Europe growing 10.3% year-to-date, offsetting declines in the U.S. Liquidity issues in the quarter began to affect the new product roadmap as the launch of several new products was delayed. In the U.S. market this was compounded by the impact of tariffs creating market instability. Key retail partners adjusted their ordering behavior in response to pricing uncertainty and shifting cost structures. Core categories such as car seats, strollers, and travel systems remained important, but were affected by softer demand and tighter retailer inventory. Dorel Juvenile remains well positioned relative to its competitors with its domestic manufacturing facilities, however this opportunity did not positively impact the third quarter as retailers were extremely cautious. As major retailers adjust their supply chain choices as tariffs evolve, the stability of domestic manufacturing presents opportunities for domestically produced items versus imports. Gross margin dollars and operating expenses for the quarter were broadly flat year-over-year resulting in an operating profit of US$4.9 million compared to US$7.2 million in 2024. Excluding restructuring costs, adjusted operating profit1 for the quarter was US$6.6 million, a decline of 17.3% from US$7.9 million the prior year. Year-to-date reported operating profit, including restructuring costs was US$14.4 million compared to US$14.0 million the prior year. Year-to-date adjusted operating profit1 was US$18.6 million, an increase of 16.7% versus the prior year. Similarly to the split of revenue, operating profit declines in the U.S were more than offset by earnings in the remaining markets. | Dorel Home | |||||||||||| | All figures in thousands of US $ | |||||||||||| | Three Months Ended September 30, (unaudited) | |||||||||||| | 2025 | 2024 | Change | |||||||||| | $ | % of rev. | $ | % of rev. | % | |||||||| | Revenue | 78,329 | 132,122 | (40.7 | )% | |||||||| | Gross profit | (13,239 | ) | (16.9 | )% | 2,809 | 2.1 | % | n.m. | |||| | Operating loss | (25,618 | ) | (13,177 | ) | 94.4 | % | |||||| | Adjusted gross profit (1) | (2,107 | ) | (2.7 | )% | 3,547 | 2.7 | % | n.m. | |||| | Adjusted operating loss (1) | (10,182 | ) | (12,039 | ) | (15.4 | )% | |||||| | n.m. = not meaningful | |||||||||||| | (1) This is a non-GAAP financial ratio or measure with no standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.

Dorel Home is being substantially reduced in size through the intentional reduction of active SKUs that are now considered non-core. In addition, sales were impacted by product availability issues, compounded by most customers holding orders due to the uncertainty of tariff rates on imports from Asia. As was the case in the second quarter, the marked decline in revenue in the third quarter was most acute in the e-commerce channel as this channel is being de-emphasized in the go-forward business model. Year-to-date revenue was US$257.3 million, a decrease of US$144.9 million, or 36.0%, compared to last year. Gross profit for the third quarter decreased by US$16.0 million compared to last year’s third quarter. The current year amount includes restructuring costs, consisting mainly of inventory write-downs, as part of the Home segment’s restructuring program to exit non-profitable items and reduce its overall distribution footprint. Adjusted gross profit1 excluding these amounts decreased by US$5.7 million and was primarily due to lower sales volumes on imported products, which more than offset the benefits of lower overhead, and a reduced domestic operations loss. Operating expenses were significantly reduced for the quarter at US$8.1 million versus US$15.6 million in the prior year’s quarter, a direct result of the restructuring activities since December of last year. As a result, the adjusted operating loss1 for the quarter was US$10.2 million, compared to US$12.0 million in the same period last year. Reported operating loss for the quarter, including restructuring costs was US$25.6 million compared to US$13.2 million the prior year. Year-to-date reported operating loss, including restructuring costs was US$72.3 million compared to US$70.4 million the prior year. Year-to-date adjusted operating loss1 was US$34.0 million compared to US$23.8 million the prior year. Liquidity issues in the quarter became more acute and prevented the segment from launching new items that were on the new product pipeline. As such sales were limited to existing items and the sale of items that are being eliminated from the product portfolio in the long term. This situation was worsened by the business environment created by new and evolving tariffs announced since the start of the year, which affected sourcing and pricing strategies. Restructuring Update During the quarter, manufacturing ceased at the Cornwall, Ontario facility as part of a broader transition to a leaner organization with a reduced product line, focused on profitable categories. In addition, the segment exited its California warehouse at the end of the quarter and shipments are now managed out of a much smaller space at the Juvenile segment’s facility in nearby Fontana, California. At the end of October, the same occurred at the segment’s Montreal facility with Dorel Home occupying a small portion of a new Juvenile warehouse. Both moves were facilitated by the active reduction of inventory levels of non-core go forward items. Work is on-going on the integration of back-office administrative functions and systems into Dorel Juvenile and the Company remains on track to complete its transition with a go-live date planned in the fourth quarter. At the end of the third quarter North American non-manufacturing headcount has been reduced from approximately 470 employees to 240 employees. By year end this figure is expected to be further reduced to approximately 160 employees, with a permanent run rate of approximately 100 employees by the second quarter of 2026. This will be split evenly between Juvenile managed distribution/support functions, with a core Home segment team focused on sales, marketing and product development. In connection with these activities, the Home segment recorded total restructuring costs of US$15.4 million, of which US$11.1 million was for write-downs on discontinued inventory items, grouped in cost of sales, and US$4.3 million was for accrued employee severance and termination costs. New Credit Facilities and Issue of Preferred Shares As announced on September 29, 2025, the Company entered into a new financing agreement with a group of lenders led by affiliates of TCW Asset Management Company LLC (“TCW”), that includes senior secured credit facilities in an amount up to US$310.0 million, consisting of a US$175.0 million senior secured asset based revolving credit facility subject to a borrowing base, of which US$110.0 million was drawn at the closing of the transaction, and a US$135.0 million term loan facility. In connection with the term loan, the Company issued warrants to TCW and certain other lenders under the credit facilities in an amount equal to 5% of the number of Dorel’s outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis, representing 1,877,408 warrants (the “Lender Warrants”). Each Lender Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one Class “Bˮ Share at an exercise price of CAD$0.01 per Lender Warrant for a period of seven years. Also, as announced on September 29, 2025, the Company entered into an agreement with Alberta Investment Management Corporation (“AIMCoˮ) for a private placement of 3,000,000 preferred shares issued for a total amount of US$75.0 million. The preferred shares have an initial annual dividend yield of 17%, paid quarterly. In connection with the issuance of the preferred shares, the Company issued warrants to AIMCo (the “AIMCo Warrants”) in an amount equal to 8% of the number of Dorel’s outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis, representing 3,003,853 AIMCo Warrants. Similar to the Lender Warrants, each of the AIMCo Warrants entitles the holder thereof to acquire one Class “Bˮ Share at an exercise price of CAD$0.01 per AIMCo Warrant for a period of seven years. The Company used the proceeds from the new credit facilities and preferred shares to repay in full Dorel’s previous senior secured debt, to pay for certain restructuring costs of Dorel’s Home segment and for working capital purposes. The new credit facilities and the proceeds from the preferred shares re-capitalized Dorel’s financial position and the Company now believes to be well positioned to advance its strategic agenda, particularly in accelerating the growth of the Juvenile segment and executing the repositioning of the Home segment. In connection with the repayment of Dorel’s previous senior secured debt, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debts in the amount of US$9.7 million mainly explaining the increase in finance expenses for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Dorel to Launch Normal Course Issuer Bid Dorel also announced today that the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) has approved Dorel’s normal course issuer bid (“NCIB”). Under the NCIB, Dorel may purchase for cancellation a maximum of 1,643,612 Class “B” Shares, representing 10% of the 16,436,129 Class “B” Shares forming the public float as at October 30, 2025. The shares may be purchased through the facilities of the TSX and on alternative trading systems in Canada over the twelve-month period from November 12, 2025 to November 11, 2026. As of October 30, 2025, Dorel had 28,530,351 Class “B” Shares issued and outstanding. Any shares purchased by Dorel under the NCIB will be at the market price of the shares at the time of such purchases. The actual number of Class B Shares that may be purchased and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by Dorel. Any purchases made by Dorel pursuant to the NCIB will be made in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSX. TSX rules permit Dorel to purchase daily, through TSX facilities, a maximum of 6,862 Class B Shares under the NCIB, representing 25% of the average daily trading volume of 27,450 Class B Shares on the TSX over the last six calendar months, subject to an exception for a “block purchase” on the TSX once per calendar week. Dorel has not repurchased any Class B Shares during the last twelve months. The Board of Directors of Dorel believes that, at appropriate times, repurchasing its shares through the NCIB represents a good use of Dorel’s financial resources, as such action can protect and enhance shareholder value when opportunities arise. In connection with the NCIB, Dorel has entered into an automatic share purchase plan with TD Securities Inc. in order to allow for purchases under the NCIB during Dorel’s “black-out” periods, as permitted by the TSX Company Manual and the Securities Act (Québec). Outside of these “black-out” periods, Dorel may repurchase shares at its discretion. Outlook “The outlook for Dorel Juvenile remains very positive and our resilience to a difficult environment is evident in our results thus far this year. We remain confident in Dorel Juvenile’s ability to navigate ongoing market challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities across our global footprint. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect further improvement in our U.S. business, which coupled with our other markets, gives us confidence that we deliver results that will well exceed prior year,” commented Dorel President & CEO, Martin Schwartz. “In the Home segment, our focus remains firmly on executing the transformation of the segment into a leaner, more agile organization. We are confident that the structural changes underway, including back-office integration with Dorel Juvenile, inventory liquidation, and facility consolidation, will position us for improved financial performance in 2026. For both our segments, while the retail environment remains challenging, and tariff pressures persist, we are actively working with our key customers and suppliers to stabilize pricing, rebuild trust, and re-establish momentum. Our team’s resilience and commitment throughout this transition give us confidence that we will enter the new year with a strong foundation to deliver significantly improved earnings,” concluded Mr. Schwartz.

These non-GAAP financial ratios and measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These non-GAAP financial ratios and measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure prepared in accordance with IFRS. Contained within this press release are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial ratios and measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. Dorel believes that the non-GAAP financial ratios and measures used in this press release provide investors with additional information to analyze its results and to measure its financial performance by excluding the variation caused by certain items that Dorel believes do not reflect its core business performance and provides better comparability between the periods presented. Excluding these items does not imply they are necessarily non-recurring. The non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess Dorel’s financial performance and to make operating and strategic decisions. Adjustments to non-GAAP financial ratios and measures As noted above, certain of our non-GAAP financial measures and ratios exclude the variation caused by certain adjustments that affect the comparability of Dorel’s financial results and could potentially distort the analysis of trends in its business performance. Adjustments which impact more than one non-GAAP financial ratio and measure are explained below. Restructuring costs Restructuring costs are comprised of costs directly related to significant exit activities, including the sale of manufacturing facilities, closure of businesses, reorganization, optimization, transformation, and consolidation to improve the competitive position of the Company in the marketplace and to reduce costs and bring efficiencies, and acquisition-related costs in connection with business acquisitions. Restructuring costs are included as an adjustment of adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating profit (loss), adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share. Restructuring costs were respectively US$17.6 million and US$43.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 (2024 – US$1.9 million and US$3.2 million). From this amount, restructuring costs recorded within cost of sales were respectively US$11.1 million and US$24.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 (2024 – US$0.7 million and US$0.7 million). Refer to the section “Impairment loss on goodwill and restructuring costs” in the MD&A for more details. Impairment loss on goodwill Impairment loss on goodwill is included as an adjustment of adjusted operating profit (loss), adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share. Impairment loss on goodwill was respectively nil and US$45.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (none in 2025). Refer to the section “Impairment loss on goodwill and restructuring costs” in the MD&A for more details. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding the impact of restructuring costs. Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP ratio and is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by revenue. Dorel uses adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin to measure its performance from one period to the next, without the variation caused by the impacts of the items described above. Dorel also uses adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin on a segment basis to measure its performance at the segment level. Dorel excludes this item because it affects the comparability of its financial results and could potentially distort the analysis of trends in its business performance. Certain investors and analysts use the adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin to measure the business performance of the Company as a whole and at the segment level from one period to the next, without the variation caused by the impact of the restructuring costs. Excluding this item does not imply it is necessarily non-recurring. These ratios and measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to a similar measure presented by other companies. | Three Months Ended | Nine Months Ended | |||||||| | Sep 30, | Sep 30, | Sep 30, | Sep 30, | |||||| | 2025 | 2024 | 2025 | 2024 | |||||| | Gross profit | 47,883 | 65,570 | 157,561 | 199,988 | ||||| | Adjustment for: | ||||||||| | Restructuring costs recorded within gross profit | 11,132 | 738 | 24,743 | 738 | ||||| | Adjusted gross profit | 59,015 | 66,308 | 182,304 | 200,726 | ||||| | Adjusted gross margin(1) | 19.8 | % | 18.7 | % | 20.0 | % | 19.1 | % | | | (1) This is a non-GAAP financial ratio and it is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by revenue. | ||||||||| | Three Months Ended | Nine Months Ended | |||||||| | Sep 30, | Sep 30, | Sep 30, | Sep 30, | |||||| | Dorel Home | 2025 | 2024 | 2025 | 2024 | ||||| | Gross profit | (13,239 | ) | 2,809 | (25,677 | ) | 19,103 | ||| | Adjustment for: | ||||||||| | Restructuring costs recorded within gross profit | 11,132 | 738 | 24,743 | 738 | ||||| | Adjusted gross profit | (2,107 | ) | 3,547 | (934 | ) | 19,841 | ||| | Adjusted gross margin(1) | (2.7 | )% | 2.7 | % | (0.4 | )% | 4.9 | % | | | (1) This is a non-GAAP financial ratio and it is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by revenue. | ||||||||| Adjusted operating profit (loss) Adjusted operating profit (loss) is calculated as operating profit (loss) excluding the impact of restructuring costs.

"A risk-off week on Wall Street is drawing to a close, with some of the most-expensive areas of the market driving stocks lower while a renewed slide in crypto leaves the asset class barely up for 2025. Equities fell on Friday, with the S&P 500 set to halt a streak of three weeks of gains as a gauge of US consumer sentiment sank to a more than three-year low. Things were even worse for the Nasdaq 100 as a rout in artificial-intelligence winners put the tech-heavy measure on track for its worst week since the April tariff-fueled tantrum – when the index entered a bear market. Worries about valuations in AI high-flyers reaching unsustainable levels surfaced after a torrid surge from this year’s bottom spurred calls for a breather. Technical indicators started flagging reasons for caution, adding to the drag on sentiment from warnings by Wall Street chief executives about a frothy market. “Major indices are facing selling pressure this week,” said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler. “Investors should prioritize good risk/reward setups, potentially after a healthy pullback within this bull market.” This week’s slide also comes at a time when earnings season is winding down, with investors becoming reliant on private data amid a dearth of economic figures due to the ongoing government shutdown. That’s left the market vulnerable to volatility as it happened in the previous session with a report painting a bleak jobs picture. While the US payrolls report was not released this Friday due to the shutdown, a survey conducted by 22V Research showed that a labor-market unwind is the biggest risk to trading. That explains why risk assets and bond yields have been unusually sensitive to any news data on that front. The S&P 500 fell to around 6,670. The Nasdaq 100 slid 1.1%. A gauge of the Magnificent Seven megacaps sank 1.8%. Bitcoin extended this week’s slide to 9%. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.09%. The dollar lost 0.2%. “While there is no jobs report Friday due to the government shutdown, there is enough private payroll and layoff data to suggest that the labor market is cooling,” said Glen Smith at GDS Wealth Management. “This cooling keeps the Fed’s rate cut plans alive for December and potentially into early 2026.” The economy remains on an upward trajectory even if economic growth slows toward trend levels in 2026, according to Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management. “The bigger concern — and the key focus of the Fed’s debate —will be the health of the labor market,” she said. “We anticipate the Fed will continue to implement rate cuts to prevent any weakness in employment from accelerating. Much of the market’s optimism hinges on the assumption that policymakers will maintain some level of support.” Despite the slide, flows remain supportive. US equity funds had an eighth consecutive week of inflows, the longest streak this year, but cash attracted the bulk of inflows, Bank of America Corp. said citing citing EPFR Global data. Traders are pondering a moment of weakness embedded in a multi-month rip higher for stocks, yet the market on balance looks poised for further gains, said Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Tony Pasquariello. “I’m not saying that risk/reward is overly compelling, nor that this is an ideal location to add a bunch of incremental risk,” the head of hedge fund coverage at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. “Looking forward, I’d argue the balance of risks still points in favor of the bulls.”",right
"Two closely watched surveys of U.S. manufacturing activity painted sharply divergent pictures in November, with one showing continued expansion and the other reporting accelerating contraction, highlighting deep uncertainty about the sector’s health amid ongoing adjustment to the new rules of global trade. The S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI registered 52.2 in November, marking the fourth consecutive month above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction. However, the reading slipped from 52.5 in October. By contrast, the ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.2, down from 48.7 in October and marking the ninth consecutive month of contraction. The divergence places the two surveys on opposite sides of the expansion-contraction divide, an unusual occurrence that suggests significantly different conditions across the manufacturing landscape. Both surveys agreed on one troubling development: manufacturers produced more goods in November even as demand weakened, leading to a substantial buildup of unsold inventory. S&P Global reported the steepest rise in warehouse stocks in the survey’s 18-and-a-half-year history, while companies reported that sales volumes fell short of expectations. “Manufacturers are making more goods but often not finding buyers for these products,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. “This unplanned accumulation of stock is usually a precursor to reduced production in the coming months.” The ISM survey showed new orders contracting for a third straight month, falling to 47.4 from 49.4 in October. S&P Global also reported a sharp slowdown in demand growth, though its measure remained in expansion territory. Export performance proved particularly weak across both surveys. ISM reported new export orders at 46.2, marking nine consecutive months of contraction. S&P Global noted the steepest decline in export orders since July, with sales to neighboring countries and key Asian economies dropping off. The Labor Market: Deteriorating or Reboudning The surveys sharply diverged on employment. S&P Global reported job growth accelerated to a three-month high, while ISM showed employment contracting at 44.0, down two percentage points from October and marking the tenth consecutive month of job losses. ISM noted that 67% of panelists reported managing head counts rather than hiring. One potential explanation for the divergence lies in the composition of the survey panels. ISM surveys tend to include larger manufacturers with more substantial international exposure, while S&P Global’s panel includes a broader cross-section of companies, including smaller, more domestically-focused firms. This difference could matter significantly given the state of global demand. European economic growth has proven sluggish, with the eurozone expanding just 0.2% in the third quarter. More critically, EU goods exports to the United States dropped more than 25% in August following implementation of a 15% tariff, according to European data, with Germany and Italy—major manufacturing economies—seeing their GDP growth stall. If large, export-oriented U.S. manufacturers are facing weak demand from abroad while smaller domestic producers fare better serving the U.S. market, the two surveys could accurately reflect different segments of the manufacturing sector. Tariffs Drive Costs Higher, Squeeze Margins Both surveys reported that tariffs continued to drive input costs higher, with metals prices particularly elevated. However, manufacturers struggled to pass these costs through to customers. S&P Global reported selling price inflation among the lowest of the year so far, citing intense competition and weak demand. Comments from ISM survey respondents painted a picture of mounting pressure and uncertainty. A transportation equipment manufacturer reported instituting “reduction of staff, new guidance to shareholders, and development of additional offshore manufacturing that would have otherwise been for U.S. export.” An electrical equipment manufacturer said conditions were “more trying than during the coronavirus pandemic in terms of supply chain uncertainty,” while a wood products company noted that “planning has been undermined by unpredictability due to inconsistent messaging from Washington.” ISM also reported that supplier delivery times improved to 49.3 from 54.2, indicating faster deliveries. While the change partially reflected resolution of some tariff-related border delays, faster deliveries also typically signal that suppliers are less busy—a sign of weakening demand in the supply chain. Inventory Buildup Raises Recession Concerns The unprecedented inventory accumulation reported by S&P Global represents a significant warning sign. When manufacturers produce more than they can sell, the typical response is to cut production in subsequent months to work down stock levels. Such production cuts often lead to reduced employment and can contribute to broader economic weakness. ISM reported a different but related concern: customers’ inventories registered 44.7, indicating they remain “too low.” Normally this would signal coming strength as customers restock, but with new orders falling, it suggests customers are reluctant to build inventory despite depleted stocks—a sign of caution about future demand. Despite current weakness, both surveys showed some improvement in business confidence. S&P Global reported optimism reached its highest level since June, with manufacturers citing expectations of improved policy support, lower interest rates, and greater political stability following the end of a federal government shutdown. However, S&P Global noted that “uncertainty remains elevated and a drag on business growth in many firms, holding confidence well below levels seen at the start of the year.” The conflicting signals leave the outlook for manufacturing uncertain. Production remained positive in both surveys, but the combination of weakening new orders, mounting inventories, and depressed export demand suggests potential challenges ahead, particularly for manufacturers dependent on international trade.

"Listen to this article in summarized format How Would the $2,000 Tariff Dividend Work In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump said, “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trump posted on Truth Social Sunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”The idea, which Trump has mentioned several times this year, would use tariff revenue collected from US importers to fund the checks, not taxpayer dollars, as per the CNN report. Trump first floated the concept in August, saying, “We’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America,” as quoted in the report. But while the idea resembles pandemic-era stimulus payments, it faces significant financial and legal hurdles, as per the report. ALSO READ:The PR genius who helped Zohran Mamdani win big — meet 35-year-old Zara Rahim Can Tariff Revenue Really Fund $2,000 Stimulus Payments According to the US Treasury, the administration has collected over $220 billion in tariff revenue, including older tariffs that predate Trump’s presidency, as per CNN. Meanwhile, the IRS reports that about 163 million Americans filed tax returns in 2024, as per the report.If every filer received $2,000, the total cost would be roughly $326 billion, more than the total tariff revenue collected, as per CNN. Even if wealthier Americans were excluded, it’s unlikely there would be enough money to cover the full amount. Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, estimated that even with an income cap of $100,000, about 150 million adults would still qualify, costing around $300 billion, as reported by CNN. ALSO READ:Private employers struggled badly — Goldman Sachs says the US lost 50,000 jobs in October Treasury Secretary Responds to Trump’s $2,000 Check Promise Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was cautious when asked about the plan. In an interview with ABC’s This Week, he said no formal proposal had been made and suggested that Trump’s mention of $2,000 could “come in lots of forms,” including through tax breaks or other offsets such as not taxing tips or overtime pay, as reported by CNN.Supreme Court May Block Trump’s Tariff Rebate Plan A major complication is the legality of the tariffs, as the Supreme Court has questioned the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to impose certain tariffs, which account for about $100 billion of the total collected revenue, as per the report.If the Court rules against the administration, some of that money may have to be returned to businesses, leaving even less available for rebate checks. Can Trump Send $2,000 Checks Without Congress Approval The US Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, and all previous stimulus payments required congressional approval. Even with Trump’s support among some lawmakers, it’s unclear whether Congress would back the plan, as per the report.Economists Warn $2,000 Tariff Checks Could Fuel Inflation While stimulus checks have been politically popular, economists warn this proposal could add fuel to inflation, reported CNN. Rebate checks could give Americans temporary financial relief but might push prices higher, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again, a move that could frustrate both consumers and fiscal conservatives. When Could Americans Receive Trump’s $2,000 Tariff Checks Even if approved, payments would take time. During the pandemic, direct deposits arrived within about a week after Congress passed relief bills, but paper checks took nearly 20 weeks to reach households, as per the report. With no formal proposal yet on the table, Americans shouldn’t expect these “tariff dividend” checks anytime soon.FAQs What is Trump’s $2,000 tariff rebate check?It’s a proposed payment to Americans funded by money collected from tariffs, not taxes. How much would each person get? Trump said “at least $2,000 per person,” excluding high-income Americans.

"Democrats say they will make life more affordable for Americans. What a joke. People should ask: If Democrat policies lower costs for Americans, why are all the most expensive cities in the U.S. run by Democrats? NEWT GINGRICH: THE SIMPLEST WAY TO MAKE AMERICAN LIFE AFFORDABLE AGAIN Where were these concerned politicians when their party and President Joe Biden blew up federal spending and drove inflation to 9% — the highest since Democrat Jimmy Carter was president? Show me one Democrat who backs sustainable measures that actually lower the cost of living, rather than fake fixes like freezing prices. Why is it so expensive to live in cities and states run by Democrats? Because they impose high taxes, costly labor regulations, expensive green mandates and restrictions on new building that drive construction costs higher. 'GONE TO FLORIDA AND TEXAS': NEW BILLBOARDS SLAM NY, NJ OVER MASSIVE RESIDENT FLIGHT TO RED STATES New York, San Francisco, Boston, San Jose and Honolulu are the costliest cities in the U.S. All are run by Democrat mayors and are in states with Democrat governors. Of the top ten most expensive towns in the country, all but one – Miami – are similarly ruled by one party – the Democrat Party. The list includes Washington, D.C. and Seattle. Why is that? First, high taxes. New York has the highest personal income tax in the U.S.; California, Hawaii and Massachusetts are close behind. Why are taxes high? Because these cities and states spend too much money and have to finance their largesse by taxing their citizens. New York, for instance, will spend some $254 billion this year, up an astonishing $100 billion from ten years ago. There are roughly 20 million people living in New York State; Florida has 23 million residents, but a budget of only $117 billion. To repeat: Florida has more citizens, but is spending about half as much as the wastrel government of New York. Naturally, Florida’s taxes are lower, and so is the cost of living. DEMOCRATS LIKE ZOHRAN MAMDANI CLAIM TO EMBRACE YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY’RE BETRAYING THEM People living in blue states don’t just get socked with high taxes, in other words, they also get hit with a high cost of living, because businesses pass along those taxes by raising prices. Blue cities and states also hit employers with costly labor rules and regulations, which find their way into the prices people pay. In California, for instance, the government demands high pay as well as complicated work scheduling and overtime rules. When the Golden State demanded fast-food companies pay their employees $20 per hour, for example, more than 10,000 workers in that business lost their jobs. More painful for consumers, a study by the Berkeley Research Group found that menu prices increased 14.5% due to the $20 wage hike. So much for helping the ""little guy."" And how about rents? In the recent New York City mayoral race, affordable housing was a big issue, helping to elect democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani. It was clever of the 34-year-old candidate, who has never held a private-sector job, to campaign on solving a problem created by his own party. DAVID MARCUS: WHY MAMDANI WILL SERVE TWO TERMS NO MATTER HOW BAD NYC GETS Mamdani is right that rents are too high in New York City. Construction costs are out of control in the Big Apple mainly because it takes too long to build, thanks to cumbersome approval processes that require sign-off from multiple agencies and the City Council, which is notoriously anti-business. Time is money in real estate. Numerous changes to that onerous regulatory process were passed by voters in the latest election, but the mayor-elect has so far not committed to reducing the power of bureaucrats to throw a proverbial spanner in the works. Instead, Mamdani proposes freezing rents on some apartments, even though studies of such measures show that over time rent caps reduce the housing stock and drive rents higher. He prefers a failed policy to one that would reduce the bureaucratic daisy chain of approvals that fatten local politicians’ coffers and sustainably drive down costs. Democrats have been seeking for an issue with which they could puncture President Trump’s popularity and unite their riven party. He was elected by a majority of Americans partly because he campaigned on ""fixing"" the inflation that drove Biden’s approval ratings into the gutter. While he has not entirely succeeded, he has made progress in three important ways: * Removing the costly green energy mandates demanded by his predecessor; * Reducing taxes for middle-class Americans and for businesses, who will feel that relief next year; * Deporting or causing millions of people in the U.S. illegally to leave on their own, relieving pressure on housing and healthcare caused by the sudden influx of millions of people. However, President Trump also adopted tariffs on imported goods that resulted in modest price hikes on items like clothing and washing machines. The liberal media predicted the White House’s tariff regimen was likely to send prices soaring; in recent weeks those alarmists have backed off their dire predictions, but there is no doubt that the tariffs have slightly boosted inflation. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In particular, tariffs drove prices on certain goods, like coffee and bananas, up substantially. Just recently, President Trump rescinded those levies, which will help shoppers. Elsewhere, healthcare premiums for the 7% of Americans using Obamacare are set to rise substantially in the new year. This sudden leap in ACA premiums is being blamed on President Donald Trump, but the GOP should remind voters that Obamacare was voted in by Democrats alone, and that they are also responsible for not only the premium subsidies that aimed to hide the real cost of insurance, but also their termination as of December 31. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Over the next year, President Trump and the GOP will have to protect Obamacare customers from losing their healthcare. At long last they must craft some changes to the ACA that will deliver on its original promise to make healthcare insurance more affordable to all Americans. Meanwhile, Republicans need to drive down the cost of living through lower taxes and reduced regulations. Those are real policies that work, not TikTok sound bites.",right
"The subsidiary of India’s Hindalco Industries will restart this hot mill in December. It had It had previously anticipated starting this mill in the March quarter. “Teams have been working around-the-clock to restore operations at Oswego quickly and safely, while leveraging alternative resources to minimize customer disruption,” it said in a statement. Novelis has recognised charges of $21 million related to this incident during the quarter. It also said that the plant is insured for property damage and business interruption losses related to such events, and about 70-80% is recoverable through insurance in future periods. The company also reported its earnings on Tuesday, and has reported a 27% year-on-year growth in its net income for the September quarter at $163 million. Excluding special items, the bottomline was 37% lower compared to the previous year at $113 million. The US-based aluminium-maker’s net sales were 10% higher compared to the previous year at $4.7 billion, mainly driven by higher average aluminum prices. Total rolled product shipments for the quarter were in line with the previous year at 941 kilotonnes. “Slightly higher automotive and aerospace shipments were offset by lower beverage packaging and specialty shipments,” the company said in a statement. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell 9% on year to $422 million, while the adjusted EBITDA made on each tonne of aluminium stood at $448, down 8% on year. The fall in EBITDA was primarily on account of a net negative tariff impact and higher aluminum scrap prices, which was partially offset by higher product pricing and cost efficiency actions, the company said. “Our second quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations for sequential improvement, reflecting solid execution in a continued dynamic environment,” Steve Fisher, chief executive officer of Novelis Inc was quoted in a release. “Our diverse global footprint will be further strengthened with the significant investment we are making in the U.S. to construct a state-of-the-art plant in Bay Minette to bring needed capacity to an undersupplied domestic market,” he said. Novelis has spent $913 million on capital expenditure in the six months of the current fiscal so far. This was primarily for strategic investments in new rolling and recycling capacity under construction, including the company's new greenfield rolling and recycling plant in Bay Minette, Alabama. The company announced its earnings after market hours in India, and shares of Hindalco Industries ended down 1.8% at 830.70 rupees on the BSE. Hindalco Industries will announce its earnings on Friday.

"Canada adds surprise 67,000 jobs in October, unemployment rate drops to 6.9% OTTAWA — Canada’s labour market caught economists off guard with a second straight month of surprise job gains in October. Statistics Canada said Friday the economy added 67,000 jobs in October, good enough to drive the unemployment rate down two tenths of a percentage point to 6.9 per cent. October’s growth was driven by part-time work with 85,000 positions added, coming off solid gains in full-time work in September. The private sector meanwhile added 73,000 jobs for its first gain since June. Economists polled by Reuters ahead of Friday’s release expected Canada’s labour market would take a breather with a loss of 2,500 jobs in October, following a surprise gain of 60,000 positions in September. Job gains across October and September now more than offset sharp drops observed in August and July. TD Bank senior economist Leslie Preston leaned on baseball metaphors in a note to clients Friday, calling the back-to-back monthly job gains a “double.” “The labour market is proving a bit more resilient to trade tensions than we had expected, but October’s data is not a home run,” Preston said. The wholesale and retail trade sector saw the most growth with 41,000 positions added in October, followed by transportation and warehousing with 30,000 jobs and the information, culture and recreation sector with 25,000 roles. Tariff-sensitive manufacturing posted a gain of 8,700 positions in October while construction lost 15,000 jobs. StatCan said goods-producing industries have shed 54,000 positions on net since January — when uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs and global trade started to ramp up — while the services side of the economy had added 142,000 jobs over that time. Ontario, a province hit hard by the trade war, led job growth provincially with 55,000 positions added. Manufacturing-heavy Windsor’s unemployment rate peaked at 11.2 per cent in June but has since trended down to 9.6 per cent, according to three-month moving averages. Young workers saw some relief in October after struggling for months in a tough labour market as youth aged 15 to 24 saw 21,000 jobs added last month, the first gain since January. That drove the youth jobless rate down 0.6 percentage points to 14.1 per cent in October after reaching a 15-year high in September, outside the pandemic. Average hourly wages were up 3.5 per cent annually in October, accelerating from 3.3 per cent the month before. While wages heated up on a monthly basis, Preston noted pay hikes have cooled from last year’s pace and the unemployment rate remains elevated in a still-soft hiring environment. “While this report shows some resilience in Canada’s labour market, it is not strength,” she said. The Bank of Canada will be parsing labour data closely as it prepares for its final interest rate decision of the year on Dec. 10, though the central bank will also get a look at November’s jobs figures before making that call. The bank’s benchmark interest rate stands at 2.25 per cent following a pair of consecutive cuts. Governor Tiff Macklem signalled last month that the central bank may be satisfied with where the benchmark interest rate stands unless incoming economic data strays from its forecasts. “Overall, today’s data is supportive of the Bank of Canada’s thinking that interest rates are now low enough to stimulate the economy, and we continue to forecast no more rate cuts from here,” said CIBC senior economist Andrew Grantham in a note. Preston agreed that October’s job figures should give comfort to the Bank of Canada that it can sit on the sidelines while the stimulative forces from previous rate cuts work their way through the economy.

"Canadians Take on More Credit Amid Lower Interest Rates as Mortgage Churn Rises and Economic Disparities Deepen Key findings from TransUnion report: - Total consumer debt rose to $2.6 trillion, driven by increased mortgage balances amid falling interest rates; mortgage originations jumped 18% YoY as Canadians opted for shorter-term fixed mortgages. - Delinquency trends reveal widening financial disparity across regions; early-stage delinquencies declined, but late-stage delinquencies rose, with Ontario, Alberta and Quebec showing the sharpest increases. - Credit card market shows signs of slowdown as originations declined further. TORONTO, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — In the third quarter of 2025, total Canadian consumer debt grew by 4.1% to reach $2.6 trillion, according to TransUnion’s Q3 2025 Credit Industry Insights Report (CIIR). Total balances grew across all products and across all risk tiers. Mortgage balances rose 4.1% year-over-year (YoY) to $1.89 trillion, while total non-mortgage debt increased 4.3% to $673 billion. This growth was driven by the combination of rising average loan sizes as well as the number of borrowers. The number of credit-active consumers grew by 2.7% YoY, while total credit balances increased at a faster pace of 4.1% over the same period. The average non-mortgage balance per consumer reached $27,100 – up 2.6% YoY – marking a shift back to the more moderate pace of growth seen before the pandemic. Homeowners Prioritize Affordability with Lower Interest Rates on New Mortgages Lower interest rates led to a combination of refinancing activity and earlier renewals that drove the continued growth in mortgage originations, which were up 18% YoY. Many borrowers opted for shorter one- or three-year fixed terms, where historically the five-year mortgage term has been the most popular choice. Borrowers are strategically choosing shorter terms to wait out the current high rates, positioning themselves to potentially secure a more favourable rate when they renew in a couple of years. The shorter mortgage terms have driven turnover in the market, creating a spike in origination volumes that may continue until interest rates become steadier. The average new mortgage loan amount increased 4.1% YoY to $359,623, indicating that affordability remains a challenge across the country, despite some easing in housing prices. The level of the national average for new mortgage amounts is primarily driven by Toronto and Vancouver, which remain Canada’s least affordable markets. Quebec City, Montreal and Saskatoon had the highest rates of average new mortgage amount increase over the last year. | Ranking Average New Mortgage Loan Size by City | |||||| | Q2 2024 | Q2 2025 | Q2’24-Q2’25 Difference | |||| | Quebec City | $ | 208,033 | $ | 237,168 | 14.01% | | | Montreal | $ | 341,085 | $ | 374,035 | 9.66% | | | Saskatoon | $ | 291,731 | $ | 316,552 | 8.51% | | | Calgary | $ | 386,825 | $ | 416,225 | 7.60% | | | Edmonton | $ | 318,151 | $ | 338,928 | 6.53% | | | Regina | $ | 263,355 | $ | 279,183 | 6.01% | | | Ottawa | $ | 379,111 | $ | 400,042 | 5.52% | | | Winnipeg | $ | 281,947 | $ | 294,597 | 4.49% | | | Vancouver | $ | 637,140 | $ | 655,359 | 2.86% | | | Toronto | $ | 541,246 | $ | 552,659 | 2.11% | | | Hamilton | $ | 429,209 | $ | 435,841 | 1.55% | | | Halifax | $ | 362,444 | $ | 361,810 | -0.17% | | Despite the increase in loan size and average owed monthly payment, mortgage delinquency rates have remained relatively low, with serious consumer delinquency rates remaining near historic lows despite an increase of 2 basis points (bps) YoY to 0.26%. Built-in resiliency measures, such as the federal mortgage stress test, have helped reduce defaults and foreclosures, driving overall delinquency rates lower. This improvement in credit performance has reinforced stability and strength across Canada’s mortgage market. “In today’s elevated interest rate environment, consumers are potentially tempted to opt for shorter-term mortgages to optimize for renewal at favorably lower rates,” said Matt Fabian, director of financial services research and consulting at TransUnion Canada. “Lenders will need to watch out for shifts in market share and adjust retention strategies in order to maintain a strong customer base as consumers shop around for more affordable rates.” Geographic Disparity in Credit Performance Rising Delinquency trends are revealing a significant disparity in the ability to pay bills and loans between those who are financially secure and those experiencing financial hardship. Early-stage delinquency rates (30 or more days past due) have declined, suggesting that fewer consumers are missing payments or that more are recovering quickly after a missed payment. However, late-stage delinquency (90+ days past due) continued to rise, indicating that those who do fall behind are struggling more severely. This contrast underscores a critical dynamic of this recovery. While overall delinquency rates may appear stable or improving, the financial health of the most vulnerable consumers is worsening and the gap between those managing to stay current and those falling deeper into delinquency is widening. Overall consumer-level early-stage delinquency (consumers 30+ days past due) has shown signs of modest improvement this year, falling 6 bps to 4.38% in Q3 2025. Meanwhile, the late-stage delinquency rate (90+ days past due) has risen by 4 bps YoY to 1.77%. While later stage delinquency has risen slightly, these levels are in line with levels observed prior to the pandemic. Given the increase in credit activity and debt levels in recent years, a corresponding increase in delinquency is to be expected. Geographic differences in performance also reflect divergent regional macroeconomic trends. Regional cost of living and wage growth differences have had a significant impact on delinquency variation between provinces. Additional pressure from macro-economic cycles as well as tariffs may also be disproportionately impacting certain goods-producing sectors and regions heavily dependent on U.S. trade, while other areas have experienced more resiliency. | Ranking Consumer Total Delinquency Rate (90+ Days Past Due) on all products by Province | ||||| | Q3 2024 | Q3 2025 | Y/Y change (bps) | ||| | Canada | 1.73 | % | 1.77 | % | 4 | | AB | 2.21 | % | 2.31 | % | 10 | | NB | 1.99 | % | 1.98 | % | 0 | | MB | 2.02 | % | 1.93 | % | -9 | | NS | 1.94 | % | 1.92 | % | -2 | | ON | 1.84 | % | 1.90 | % | 6 | | SK | 1.97 | % | 1.85 | % | -13 | | NL | 1.80 | % | 1.75 | % | -6 | | PEI | 1.69 | % | 1.74 | % | 5 | | BC | 1.64 | % | 1.65 | % | 0 | | QC | 1.21 | % | 1.26 | % | 5 | Ontario, Alberta and Quebec have seen more pronounced performance deterioration over the past year. Alberta had the highest delinquency rate in the country and the sharpest increase in delinquency rate, rising 10 bp YoY to 2.31%. This significant rise reversed a generally improving trend in prior years and was driven by a high unemployment rate1 increase, which generally impacts the financial stability of affected households. Ontario’s consumer delinquency rate rose 6 bp to 1.90%, which may signal mounting financial stress as it has also seen a larger increase in its unemployment rate than other regions, rising from 5.6% in 2023 to 7.8% in 2025 likely driven by manufacturing slowdown and impacts of tariffs on auto, steel and aluminum manufacturing. Quebec’s delinquency rate increased 5 bps from the prior year to 1.26% in Q3 2025, indicating some growing credit stress from the impacts of U.S. tariffs on exports. Despite the delinquency rate increase, Quebec’s households are overall better positioned than Ontario and Alberta with relatively lower delinquency and unemployment rates. Delinquency rates in British Columbia remained stable at 1.65%, the second lowest delinquency rate across all provinces. However, lumber tariffs and the potential for related unemployment could cause a future rise in delinquencies, especially in lumber producing areas. Card Growth Slows Down with Scaled Back Appetite New credit card originations remained restrained, down 8.6% YoY as lenders maintained a cautious stance. Even so, the YoY pace of decline has slowed compared to previous quarters, signaling the early signs of stabilization amid improving macroeconomic conditions. While total originations were lower, average new card limits climbed 4.8% to over $6,500, pointing to selective lending and a focus on lower risk acquisition strategies. The decline in originations also mirrors the slowing of the country’s new Canadian population, since this segment usually takes on a credit card as their first credit product. Average card balance per consumer rose 1.9% YoY to $4,652, with below-prime consumers seeing a sharper increase of 2.4%, compared to just 1% among prime and super-prime tiers, signaling that financial pressure is disproportionately impacting higher-risk borrowers. The recent upward trend in household financial activity suggests mounting pressure on consumers, likely driven by rising living costs and evolving spending behaviors, and has led to average card balances rising to pre-pandemic levels. Overall revolving balances (the portion of that total balance that is carried over from one month to the next and is subject to interest charges) remained flat from prior year. However, looking at specific consumer segments shows a different, yet potentially more accurate, picture. Below prime consumers saw an increase in revolving balances, up 2% YoY, while prime and better consumers saw lower revolving balances, down 4% YoY. Average monthly credit card spend per consumer was down 3.4% YoY to $1,373, possibly connected to consumers declining optimism around the economy amid rising unemployment and continued trade tension. Card delinquency rates continue to reflect a divide in consumer payment behavior. Early-stage delinquency held steady year-over-year at 2.51%, remaining more than 20 basis points below pre-pandemic levels. This stability may be partly due to lenders’ more cautious stance, including reduced originations to subprime borrowers, which has helped keep early-stage delinquencies in check. Later-stage delinquency also showed modest movement, rising just 1 basis point year-over-year to 0.91%. However, it remains slightly above pre-pandemic levels, as consumers who fall into late-stage delinquency often face mounting fees and interest, making recovery more difficult. Additionally, the lag between financial distress and charge-offs, typically 9-12 months, means current late-stage delinquencies may reflect economic stress from earlier periods. Millennials and baby boomers, who had seen increases in card delinquency through 2023, are showing signs of recovery, with millennial consumer-level delinquency down 3 bps YoY to 1.11% while baby boomer delinquency rates improved 1 bp to 0.49%. Gen Z consumers continued to struggle with consumer-level card delinquency as rates rose 8 bps to 1.29%. There was also improvement from subprime cardholders, with delinquency rates improving 12 bps to 10.7% after rising over 100 bps the prior year, potentially pointing to easing strain on this segment. Other risk tiers remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. “Looking ahead, while rising unemployment and tariff-related pressures continue to pose challenges, early signs of stabilization in core economic indicators—particularly interest rates and inflation—are beginning to offer some relief to consumers. In response, issuers are cautiously re-engaging with the market through targeted acquisition strategies, disciplined credit line management and personalized offers aimed at driving sustainable balance growth while maintaining a prudent approach to risk. ,” Fabian said. “These approaches aim to capture high-value segments while maintaining portfolio resilience, positioning lenders for a more competitive and adaptive credit landscape in the months ahead.” Consumer Credit Indicator Remains Muted Compared to Prior Year In Q3 2025, Canada’s Consumer Credit Industry Indicator (CII) fell 6 points compared to the same quarter in 2024. This lower indicator value indicates a continuing deterioration in the overall health of the Canadian credit market, reflecting weakening consumer behaviors and worsening credit supply conditions.

"Eby says B.C. won't run anti-tariff ads alone as it had planned VANCOUVER — British Columbia Premier David Eby says the province is walking back plans to run anti-tariff advertisements in the United States after a meeting with federal officials about the province’s beleaguered forestry sector. Eby said Monday that B.C. won’t be running the ads “by ourselves,” in favour of aligning with the federal government in its dealings with the U.S. government under President Donald Trump. “The unfair and unjustified tariffs imposed by the White House on this sector directly threatens thousands of jobs right across the country,” Eby said at a news conference after a forestry summit meeting with federal officials and others. “Our deep concern is that without imminent action, that things will get significantly worse for families and for communities across the county and particularly in British Columbia.” Eby, speaking alongside Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, said the shift in strategy is to ensure communications with U.S. authorities are aligned with federal officials as they discuss softwood lumber tariffs from the United States. “Minister LeBlanc didn’t have to ask,” Eby answered Monday when a reporter asked LeBlanc if he requested that the B.C. government hold off on its anti-tariff advertising campaign. “I knew that it was a source of anxiety for many people, including potentially the federal government.” The decision comes after Trump last month blamed an anti-tariff ad campaign by Ontario for his cancellation of trade talks with Canada. The premier said the planned ad campaign by B.C. came up at the Vancouver summit on how to prop up the forest industry in the face of American fees and tariffs. “Given the reaction to the Ontario tariffs, one of my commitments to the federal government was that if they came to the table with us, if they sat with us, that we would work with them on communications, on strategy, on how to support the sector and how to move forward,” he said as the meeting wrapped up. He said LeBlanc and his team wanted an “integrated approach” and B.C. will ensure future communications are in line when it comes to speaking with the Americans. Eby said that the forest industry in Canada is larger than the automotive sector and it deserves to be treated with respect. After the meeting Monday, he said he’s confident the federal government understands that. “This was very heartening to me. I felt like we were going it alone there for a while, and to know that we’ve got this federal team in our corner is hugely helpful to me and resulted in our commitment to work forward, in terms of any communications with Americans, with the federal government.” LeBlanc said the forestry sector is “massively important” to B.C.’s gross domestic product, and the province and federal government must work together to bolster supports for the forestry sector. “The hour is grave,” LeBlanc said. “This is a critical industry to the fabric of the whole country.” In September, the Trump administration imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Canadian companies ranging from 26 per cent to more than 47 per cent, then threatened to add another 10 per cent last month, claiming Canada’s industry is a risk to U.S. national security. Eby announced that there will be a working group to set out supports for the sector. Kim Haakstad, the president of the BC Council of Forest Industries, said in a statement that the group is pleased the governments are working together to keep people working — even when markets are challenging. Haakstad said the working group should also include the industry to help focus on keeping mills open and people working, which means prioritizing a new “fair and durable” softwood lumber deal and accelerating the rollout of the $1.2 billion the federal government has already set aside for the industry. She said in an interview Monday that the federal and provincial governments’ co-ordination shows that “we’re starting to understand the real moment that forestry is in and the urgency of action that’s required.” She said Canadian lumber products are still a preferred building material despite that “there’s been a lobby group in the United States around for a long time that’s been trying to stop Canadian lumber from coming across the border.” “It keeps coming because people like our product.” Haakstad said the industry is “more united” across the country than ever and what happens in the U.S. can’t be predicted, but it still remains “our most important market and trading partner. “There is a need for Canadian lumber that still exists in the United States, and they’re just making it more expensive for Americans,” she said. The Canada-U.S. softwood lumber dispute has been a friction point for decades, with the United States imposing duties and fees alleging Canada subsidizes its industry and dumps lumber into the U.S. market. The U.S. Lumber Coalition said in a statement Monday that Canada has “massive excess and unneeded lumber capacity,” most of which it ships across the border “at the direct expense of U.S. jobs.” “Canada should reverse its massive lumber subsidy programs and should stop treating the U.S. market as its dumping ground for Canadian lumber,” said Zoltan van Heyningen, the coalition’s executive director.

"The report claims that the tribunal's order has recalibrated the methodology for calculating tariffs for the five-year span from FY09 to FY14, leading to a scenario in which the two airports now owe an amount of more than Rs 50,000 crore because of under recovery during that timeframe. The money will reportedly come from passenger fees, landing costs, and parking fees, which may make tickets more expensive, forcing people to pay more from their pockets. Airlines and AERA challenge order in Supreme Court, says report As per the report, the order has been challenged in the Supreme Court by the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA), domestic airlines as well as foreign ones such as Lufthansa, Air France and Gulf Air. The case will reportedly be heard by a bench of justices Aravind Kumar and Nilay Vipinchandra Anjaria on Wednesday. Mumbai and Delhi airportsâ user development fee to see huge jump? The user development fee for international travellers flying out of Mumbai is reportedly set to jump steeply from the current Rs 615 to Rs 13,495. The user development fee (UDF) levied on domestic passengers at Delhi airport may also increase to Rs 1,261 from Rs 129, and that for international passengers to Rs 6,356 from Rs 650, as per the report. At the Mumbai airport, it can reportedly jump from Rs 175 to Rs 3,856.TDSAT is the appellate tribunal responsible for adjudicating disputes and appeals related to both telecom and airport economic regulatory matters. Sharp fee hike could dampen passenger growth Government officials are reportedly worried that such a sharp increase in charges will hit passenger growth. ET Bureau quoted a government official as saying: âIrrespective of the merits of the order, passengers shouldnât become victims of protracted legal battles between airports and airlines.âThe government official further said: âThis will be a body blow to passengers as overnight, there will be a massive ticket price increase. Airports are natural monopolies and airlines will have no other option but to pass on the charges to passengers.â AERAâs late establishment led to data gaps in calculations, says report The report says that AERA sets airport charges for five-year periods based on the operatorâs investments and revenue, but the regulator itself was established only in April 2009 around three years after the Airports Authority of India (AAI) transferred ownership of the airports to DIAL and MIAL. DIAL belongs to GMR Group, while MIAL, which is now operated by the Adani Group, was under GVKâs control at the time. Since data on assets and investment prior to the handover were unreliable, an agreement between the government and the two private operators was reportedly made in 2006 for the Hypothetical Regulatory Asset Base (HRAB). While fixing the tariff for FY09-14, AERA only took into account the value of aeronautical assets such as infrastructure and facilities directly required for flight operations and passenger processing, such as runways, terminals and check-in counters, the report says. However, DIAL and MIAL moved TDSAT, saying AERA must consider the value of non-aeronautical assets too, as per the report. These assets include the likes of duty free shops, car parking and lounges, among others. The court passed the matter back to the tribunal, which, in July, overturned its previous order and supported the airport operators, saying non-aeronautical assets should have been considered by AERA, the report says The tribunal reportedly said in its defence that during the period under the dispute, airport tariffs were being calculated based on the value of non-aeronautical assets. TDSATâs revised method prompts proposal to recover Rs 50,000 crore via UDF As per TDSATâs revised directive on how charges should be calculated, the two airports are estimated to have under-recovered nearly Rs 50,000 crore in tariffs, as per the report.To bridge this gap, the tribunal has reportedly suggested raising the User Development Fee (UDF).",right
"Brazil hails US tariff rollback as 'significant progress' and seeks more exemptions SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil’s Vice President Geraldo Alckmin on Friday hailed U.S. President Donald Trump’s order to remove the additional import tariffs on some agribusiness products as “significant progress,” but said the country will keep pushing for more exemptions. “We want to exclude more products and move forward in the negotiation,” he told journalists in Brasilia. Alckmin, who also serves as Trade minister, led the negotiations with the U.S. along with Brazilian diplomats and business leaders. Cecafe, Brazil’s coffee exporters council, celebrated Trump’s latest order and called the tariff hike “a complete loss of competitiveness.” “The tariff reversal comes after months of intense work representing the interests of Brazilian coffee. It is a historic victory for the entire coffee agribusiness production chain,” the council said in a statement. Brazil has long been a key supplier of beef and coffee to the United States. On Thursday, Trump lifted tariffs on Brazilian goods as part of an effort to lower consumer costs for Americans. The decision affected coffee, fruit and beef, among other products. The U.S. leader had imposed additional import taxes on Brazilian goods, citing trade practices he deemed unfair and the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who was later sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting to stage a coup after losing the 2022 election. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, according to the Census Bureau. Before the tariffs, U.S. government data showed Brazil, the world’s top coffee producer, supplied about 30% of the American market, followed by Colombia at roughly 20% and Vietnam at about 10%. “The removal of the 40% tariff imposed by the U.S. government on several Brazilian agricultural products is a victory for dialogue, diplomacy and common sense,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Thursday on X. He also shared a video reacting to Trump’s order, saying he was pleased with the decision. Trump and Lula have been negotiating over trade, which could further reduce tariffs. Lula also praised “the frank dialogue” with Trump, and said that Brazil would continue talks. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Listen to this article in summarized format Economists expect the rupee to appreciate by 100-150 paise from current levels to 88/$1 in the event of a positive trade deal, while further delay could push the currency towards 90 to 90.5 This week is expected to be volatile, with the rupee likely to trade in the 89-90 per dollar range, reflecting the immediate market reaction after the currency breached the psychological 89 level, unless the central bank again steps in to defend the 89.49 mark. ""The narrow range seen in the past month has been broken on the upside (88.80), so there will be increased volatility in the coming weeks, and we may see movement from 88.50 to 90.50. The range gets wider now, so we can expect to see movement on developing US-India tariff updates and stop losses getting breached,"" said Abhilash Koikkara, head of forex and commodities at Nuvama. ""This sharp depreciation will further elevate volatility in November, which had been subdued earlier this month even though the rupee settled at a weaker value,"" Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser, State Bank of India Group, said in a report on Saturday. In case of a favourable trade deal, experts forecast the rupee to appreciate to 88, with a risk towards a stronger level. Dhiraj Nim, economist and FX strategist at ANZ Banking Group, expects a favourable trade deal and maintains his call of 88/$1 by December with an upside risk. However, a favourable trade deal isn't going to cause deep appreciation in the rupee, both Nim and Koikkara said. Both expect the Reserve Bank to absorb dollars and build its reserves back, and roll over its short forward book. India's forex reserves stood at $692 billion in the week of November 14, versus $703 billion in the week of September 12. RBI's short positions in the forward book increased in September for the first time in seven months by $6 billion to $59.5 billion, the latest data showed. ""The RBI would likely prefer to roll over the forwards book, which started to pile up from the central bank's intervention both in the spot and the NDF market. We expect the forward book to increase even more in October versus September. However, for this month, we may have to see how RBI's intervention pans out in the second half of November,"" Nim said. He and Koikkara expect the rupee to appreciate by 100-150 paise in case of a timely and positive trade deal.

"Listen to this article in summarized format For the first 11 months of 2025, foreign investors were net sellers of $16.4 billion (₹1.4 lakh crore) of Indian equities including primary and secondary markets. FPIs have sold aggressively in the domestic market in 2025 so far compared with an outflow of $1.7 billion (₹15,019.6 crore) in the corresponding period of the previous year. Moreover, they had turned to be net buyers last year as a whole with a modest purchase worth $124 million (₹427 crore), driven by their focus on the primary market where they invested net $14.5 billion (₹1.2 lakh crore). In the current year so far, they have invested $7.6 billion (₹66,187 crore) in the primary market notwithstanding their heavy selling worth $24 billion (₹2.1 lakh crore) in the secondary market, which has far exceeded the $14.3 billion worth of selling in the whole of 2024. The domestic mutual funds continued to offset the FPI outflow by increasing the extent of equity investments in November. The local mutual funds bought ₹38,173.8 crore worth of equities in November till 26th. This year so far, they have invested ₹4.5 lakh crore in equities, exceeding ₹4.3lakh crore invested in the whole of the previous year. For December, the better than expected growth in the gross domestic product (GDP), corporate earnings expectation for the third quarter and any progress on the US tariff front will be crucial factors for the FPI fund flow. In addition, their activity will likely be limited owing to the holiday season in the second half of the month.

"On Nov. 9, 2025, Trump posted on social media: “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.” But questions about who qualifies, how it’s paid, and whether it’s financially realistic remain largely unanswered. Economists quickly pointed out that the U.S. collected about $90 billion in tariff revenue last year, according to Treasury data. That’s only about one-third of what it would take to send $2,000 to roughly 150 million Americans — a payout totaling nearly $300 billion. Trump claims the dividend would exclude “high-income people,” but no income threshold has been released. Past stimulus programs, such as the 2020 CARES Act, used cut-offs around $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for joint filers, which analysts believe could serve as a model if the plan ever materializes. What is Trump’s $2,000 tariff dividend plan? President Donald Trump has promised a new “tariff dividend” of at least $2,000 per person. The proposal, announced on November 9, 2025, aims to return part of the tariff revenue collected from imported goods to U.S. citizens.Trump said on Truth Social that the money will go to “everyone except high-income people,” calling it a “dividend for the American people.” The payment, he said, is meant to share the benefits of his expanded tariff program, which has raised billions from imports, mainly from China and Mexico. The White House says the move could “reward working Americans” while maintaining pressure on foreign producers. However, no detailed rollout plan or legislative draft has been released yet. Who actually qualifies for Trump’s $2,000 tariff check? The eligibility details remain unclear, but here’s what is known so far. The payment would likely go to low- and middle-income Americans. High-income earners will be excluded, though Trump has not defined what income level counts as “high.”Officials suggest the program may follow income caps similar to the COVID-19 stimulus payments — which phased out for individuals earning above $100,000 and couples above $200,000. Sources close to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News that the payment could take several forms: a direct check, tax credit, or even a rebate deduction. Trump, however, insists that “people will see the money in their hands.” How much would it cost, and where will the money come from? Economists estimate the cost of the $2,000 tariff dividend could reach $600–700 billion if distributed to most U.S. adults. The Trump administration claims it will be funded from tariff revenues, which reportedly brought in over $200 billion since the start of 2025 due to new import duties on goods from China, Mexico, and Europe.But analysts warn the math doesn’t add up. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), tariff revenues currently cover only about one-third of what such a nationwide payout would require. Critics argue that tariffs also increase consumer prices, meaning Americans may indirectly “pay” for their own rebate through higher costs on everyday goods. Who gets left out under the current plan? Trump said the dividend will not go to “high-income people.” However, no firm income bracket has been set. It’s also unclear whether dependents, non-citizens, or retirees will qualify.Immigration and tax experts say the payment may follow the same eligibility structure as IRS-administered stimulus checks, which excluded nonresidents and undocumented workers. So far, the Treasury Department has not confirmed whether Social Security recipients or people without tax filings would automatically receive the dividend. When will the $2,000 tariff dividend payments begin? There’s no official start date yet. The plan still requires congressional authorization or an executive order detailing how the funds will be disbursed.Some White House insiders say the first payments could roll out by mid-2026, possibly timed with the 2026 midterm campaign season. Treasury officials are reportedly studying how to deliver funds through direct deposit systems already used for IRS refunds. For now, Americans are being told to “wait for further guidance” as the administration works on the legal framework. Until then, the tariff dividend remains a promise, not a payment.

"Christine Lagarde warns European growth is linked to 'disappearing' world ECB chief accuses policymakers of six years of inaction as export-dependent model becomes defunct Europe’s economic prosperity is “geared towards a world that is gradually disappearing”, Christine Lagarde said on Friday, imploring the bloc’s policymakers to finally overcome “years of inaction.” In a scathing speech, the president of the European Central Bank warned that Europe’s “old growth model” had become outdated, as its dependence on exports had become a “vulnerability”. Making the keynote address at the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt, Lagarde pointed to a two-year-old ECB forecast that predicted that euro area exports would grow by about 8 per cent by mid-2025. “In reality, they have not grown at all,” she said. Without directly mentioning Germany, she said that “countries with large manufacturing sectors” had faced “a prolonged slump in industrial production.” In Germany, the bloc’s largest economy, manufacturing output fell to 2005 levels over the summer, with carmakers and the wider engineering sector falling into crisis. Lagarde urged EU policymakers to respond by strengthening the domestic economy, which she said was already showing “latent strengths.” “Our experience this year has shown that a resilient domestic economy can shield Europe against global turbulence,” she said. Across the Euro area, growth this year has been slightly stronger than central bankers and most analysts expected. In the third quarter, GDP grew at twice the expected pace as French output expanded at its fastest rate since 2023. After a series of eight cuts in interest rates since mid-2024, which halved borrowing costs to two per cent, the ECB has kept monetary policy unchanged since June. - Lagarde: International trade will never be the same - Eurozone braces for conflicting data of negligible inflation gains - Advertisement 1Story continues below Lagarde called on policymakers to double down on existing domestic strengths by removing internal barriers to trade, pointing to a forthcoming ECB analysis showing that current hurdles were equivalent to a 100 per cent tariff on services and a 65 per cent tariff on goods. Lagarde accused policymakers of squandering the past six years, during which “our internal market has stood still”, and warned of a slide into slow but steady decline. “Another six years of inaction — and lost growth — would not just be disappointing. It would be irresponsible,” she said. Europe’s economic weaknesses “do not trigger dramatic crises” but “erode growth quietly, as each new shock nudges us on to a slightly lower trajectory”, Lagarde said. Over time, she said, this added up to a “material” setback to growth and productivity. © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"The Trump administration is preparing broad exemptions to certain tariffs in an effort to ease elevated food prices that have provoked anxiety for American consumers, according to three people briefed on the actions. The change would apply to certain reciprocal tariffs the president announced in April, including on products coming from countries that have not struck trade deals with the administration, the people said, discussing a pending announcement on the condition of anonymity. The exemptions are expected to include beef and citrus products, although the people cautioned that President Donald Trump has not made a final decision. The issue of foreign countries increasing beef imports has been a source of contention among U.S. ranchers, who say it runs counter to Trump's philosophy of boosting domestic production. If the proposal goes forward, it would be the latest rollback of one of the president's key economic policies over growing concerns about affordability, even as Trump has insisted -- wrongly -- that prices are down. Last week, Democrats won elections around the country in large part by harnessing worries about the cost of living. The plan likely to take effect goes beyond the exemptions that Trump proposed in September in an executive order, which would have been confined to products that are not primarily made or grown in the United States, and which are purchased from countries with which the Trump administration has struck trade deals. That order directed Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, and the U.S. trade representative, Jamieson Greer, to decide on exemptions for more than 1,000 product categories, including metals and minerals, antibiotics, plane parts, and foreign agricultural products including coffee, pineapples, avocados and vanilla beans. Lutnick has pushed for the series of exemptions on food items under consideration, citing high prices, according to two of the people briefed on the matter. If the administration chooses to offer exemptions for products from countries that have not entered into trade agreements with the United States, that could risk appearing to reward countries that did not try to work with the administration. The White House did not confirm the specifics of the proposal. Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement that ""the Trump administration is committed to pursuing a nimble, nuanced, and multifaceted strategy on trade and tariffs."" Officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce declined to comment. The executive order the administration issued in September specified that such exemptions would apply to tariffs set through the trade agreements the Trump administration has negotiated with other governments, a list that includes the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and a few other nations. On Thursday, the Trump administration announced four more trade deals, with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador. Trump imposed double-digit tariffs on countries globally in April, but has reduced those levies for governments that strike trade deals. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, said on Fox News Wednesday that the administration would be making ""substantial"" announcements about tariff exemptions over the next few days, saying that they would target ""things we don't grow here."" He named coffee, bananas and other fruits. ""So that will bring the prices down very quickly,"" he said. The administration's push to try to reduce food prices comes after Democrats won key elections in last week's off-year elections with candidates that focused heavily on affordability and a promise to bring down costs. Democrats won governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey by wide margins, and they won statewide races in Pennsylvania and Georgia. The day after the election, Vice President JD Vance posted on social media that Republicans need ""to focus on the home front."" ""We're going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that's the metric by which we'll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond,"" Vance wrote on social platform X. Even before the elections, administration officials have been concerned about high prices at American grocery stores, which have worsened the president's approval rating. Food prices have risen significantly this year, including for coffee and beef, government data has shown. Coffee prices were up nearly 19% for the year in September, the most recent month of data available. A gauge of consumer confidence hit near-record lows this month, weighed down in part by concerns over tariffs. But not everyone in the administration agrees that such broad exemptions from tariffs are wise. Exemptions could further rankle ranchers and farmers who are a powerful political bloc for the Trump administration. In recent weeks, Trump clashed with American ranchers over a plan to buy more beef from Argentina, a tiny source of U.S. imports, in a move the president said would lower domestic prices. It's also not clear how much of an effect the tariff exemptions would have on U.S. prices. Many agricultural products imported into the United States come from Canada or Mexico, which already have significant exemptions to tariffs under the trade agreement the United States shares with those countries. The new trade agreements announced Thursday, with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador, will open up those markets to U.S. exports, secure access to critical minerals and enshrine new rules for intellectual property and the tech industry, the administration said. An administration official who briefed reporters said the deals would leave U.S. tariffs on Ecuador at 15%, and the remaining three countries at 10%, though some goods that aren't produced in the U.S. will be tariff free. The official said the administration expected to see a positive effect on prices from exemptions on items like coffee, cocoa and bananas, and that the measure was a ""common-sense"" approach to trade policy that would still protect domestic producers.

"Reeves Finally Faces Day of Reckoning on Tax-Raising Budget In the 84 days since UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves announced the date of her second budget, she’s told both bond-market investors and Labour Party backbenchers that it was drafted with them in mind. (Bloomberg) — In the 84 days since UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves announced the date of her second budget, she’s told both bond-market investors and Labour Party backbenchers that it was drafted with them in mind. On Wednesday, it becomes clear whether she can please both of these very different audiences, when she stands at the dispatch box in the House of Commons and puts an end to months of speculation. Reeves left Downing Street to be escorted through crowds of protestors on her way to deliver the speech in Parliament. Earlier, Starmer had chaired a cabinet meeting in which he described the budget as a document built on choices centered on fairness, rather than a spreadsheet. While the chancellor began the unusually long budget run-up by signaling that she would prioritize the markets, she tacked left toward the demands of Labour Members of Parliament as the weeks wore on. The flurry of reports about what the Treasury was considering — and suddenly abandoning — was intense even by Britain’s traditional standard of pre-budget speculation. It didn’t help that appeasing the Labour Party turned into a matter of survival: with the budget looming, a series of shadowy challenges to Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s leadership called into question the future of the project of which she is an inalienable part. Reeves needs to announce measures that will both placate the rebels who rejected her past efforts to cut spending and the gilt holders who’ve been demanding a premium on UK debt relative to the likes of the US, Germany and Japan. Although Reeves is expected to start speaking around 12:30 p.m., it may be hours if not weeks before investors to settle on a view of whether her plans represent a credible solution to Britain’s fiscal challenges. “The market has had its expectations well-managed — the mood music is pretty low,” Victoria Clarke, chief UK economist for Santander, told Bloomberg Television on Wednesday. The pound traded in a narrow range against the US dollar and euro, while gilts edged lower alongside comparable bond markets as traders wait for the budget to begin. Only economic growth would free Reeves from these trade-offs, and that’s been elusive. Although, on paper, the government was quick to fulfill its target of registering the fastest-growing economy in the G-7, that rate’s not been sustained. And the dire productivity that’s hampered the UK for years is finally set to show up in the calculations of her budget watchdog, when the Office for Budget Responsibility corrects a historical track-record of excessive optimism and constrains her even further. Reeves made a direct appeal for public support in a video released ahead of the budget, acknowledging public frustration at the state of the economy and pledging to do more. “I know that the cost of living is still bearing down on family finances, I know that people feel frustrated at the pace of change, or angry at the unfairness in our economy,” Reeves said, blaming Brexit and austerity efforts under the previous Conservative government for the challenges she faced. What Bloomberg Economics says… “The prize for getting it right could be significant – gilt yields would likely fall and uncertainty would ebb. Recent reports suggesting the government has backed away from raising income tax makes it likely Reeves will pencil in the bulk of the fiscal adjustment toward the end of the decade and lean on numerous small revenue-raising measures. That’s a riskier strategy and one that investors may not buy.” —Dan Hanson and Ana Andrade, UK economists. Read the full PREVIEW on The Terminal. Reeves will need to perform a repair job on the UK’s finances, after factors such as costly policy U-turns, headwinds from President Donald Trump’s global tariff war and the OBR’s productivity downgrade have left her facing a £20 billion ($26 billion) fiscal hole. “It’s a balancing act,” said Luke Tryl, executive director for More in Common UK, referring to the task facing Reeves. “Her pitch that this is a responsible budget which leaves enough headroom but fundamentally has Labour values at its heart and is redistributive is probably the only way to land it.” That leaves the chancellor needing to draw up a hefty package of diverse tax hikes, a difficult sell to the public after she already raised levies by £40 billion at her inaugural budget last year and promised she wouldn’t come back for more. Measures she may announce are expected to include: - Freezing income tax thresholds for two more years from 2028 - Imposing a so-called mansion tax on properties worth more than £2 million - Capping salary sacrifice programs - Levying higher alcohol, gambling and dividend taxes - A new pay-per-mile tax for electric vehicles - A new tourist tax, to be levied by mayors - A cut to the annual tax-free cash ISA limit to £12,000, compared to £20,000 currently - A stamp duty holiday for three years for investors purchasing shares in newly-listed companies She’s due to deliver this package after the tumultuous build-up, which included a media intervention where she appeared to prepare the public for a hike in income tax, a highly controversial measure that would have breached Labour’s pre-election promises. The plan was dropped the very same week after people familiar with the matter said Reeves had received improved forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Yet there was a strong sense that political jeopardy also lay behind the hand-brake turn. The change in her messaging caused markets to whipsaw and fueled a sense of pre-budget chaos. For bond traders, a key focus will be how much of a buffer Reeves creates against her fiscal rules with her tax-and-spend package, having left a slim £9.9 billion margin at her last budget, which has since been eroded. Reeves is expected to build fiscal headroom of somewhere in the region of £15 billion-£20 billion, a cushion that would reduce the likelihood of further tax hikes in years ahead. Investors will be on the lookout for the credibility of her plans to achieve that goal. “One risk is around this so called ‘smorgasbord’ approach, a long list of tax rises, potentially including quite a lot of taxes on capital, mobile wealth and investment, that could maybe not end up raising the revenues that are forecast,” said Rupert Harrison, senior adviser at PIMCO who was economic adviser to the former Conservative Chancellor George Osborne, speaking on Bloomberg Radio. “The credibility of those tax rises is important.” Reeves is hoping her budget package will be rewarded by markets with a decline in government borrowing costs. But traders have also been bracing for potential market shocks, with investors loading up on currency hedges to protect against volatility. Reeves will also present tackling the cost-of-living as a key focus of her budget, with policies including hiking the national minimum wage and national living wage, freezing rail fares and cutting energy bills. More in Common’s Tryl said Reeves needed to stress those affordability measures to win over voters, given the period of pre-budget uncertainty. “Lots of voters are feeling more worried than normal about what’s coming,” he said. —With assistance from Philip Aldrick.

"Central 1 reports 2025 third quarter financial results VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Central 1 Credit Union (Central 1) today reported third quarter performance and stable financial results across business lines, consistent with plans and expectations. “This quarter’s results show consistent financial performance and solid management amid economic uncertainty,” said Sheila Vokey, Central 1’s President & CEO. “As an aggregated services provider, we continue to focus time and energy on investing in our payments infrastructure along with the industry and supporting clients through a generational transformation of Canada’s payments system.” Third quarter 2025 compared with third quarter 2024: - Net income was $24.9 million, compared with $5.8 million - Adjusted net income1 was $25.2 million, compared with $12.5 million - Net fair value gains were $30.7 million, compared with $6.9 million - Net interest income was $17.5 million, compared with $9.7 million - Return on equity (ROE) 2,3 was 12.2%, compared with 2.1% - Adjusted ROE2 was 12.1%, compared with 6.0% Year-to-date 2025 compared with year-to-date 2024: - Net income of $22.2 million, compared with $47.8 million, includes a $29.3 million⁴ provision associated with the transfer of the digital banking operations to Intellect Design Arena Ltd. that occurred in the first quarter of 2025 - Adjusted net income1 was $53.9 million, compared with $66.6 million - Net fair value gains of $41.7 million, compared with $60.2 million - Net interest income of $55.5 million, compared with $34.0 million - ROE2,3 was 5.4%, compared with 8.0% - Adjusted ROE2 was 8.9%, compared with 11.2% Core Business & Financial Performance Central 1’s third quarter and year-to-date (YTD) continue to report strong financial performance in 2025. Central 1’s net income for the third quarter was $24.9 million, an increase of $19.1 million, compared to the third quarter last year, reflecting continued strength in net interest income and significant net fair value gains. The reported YTD net income was $22.2 million, a decrease of $25.6 million, compared to the same period last year, primarily attributable to the recognition of the provision for onerous contracts related to the transition of Digital Banking to Intellect Design Arena Ltd. (Intellect). Treasury Treasury reported a net income of $31.3 million, an increase of $19.7 million compared to $11.6 million reported in the same quarter last year. The strong performance was primarily driven by a $7.7 million increase in net interest income and an increase of $24.1 million in net fair value gains. The growth in net interest income is driven by a favorable funding mix, leading to a meaningful reduction in interest expense. Additionally, the increase in net fair value gains was driven primarily by narrowing credit spreads, which contributed positively to the reported net income. Payments Payments delivered net income of $0.2 million for the quarter, compared to $0.7 million in the same quarter last year, reflecting continued investment in strategic initiatives to support long-term growth. Non-interest income grew by $2.5 million year-over-year, driven by increased transaction volumes across select payment services. A $3.2 million increase in non-interest expenses reflects Central 1’s ongoing commitment to innovation and digital transformation. The Payments group continues to invest in key technology initiatives that support the significant transformation of the payments landscape in Canada.

"Akio Toyoda, CEO of the Japanese car manufacturer Toyota, went full Make America Great Again at a NASCAR event in Japan, donning a red hat and a Trump-Vance shirt. Toyoda donned the pro-Trump garb on Sunday, just two days ahead of his company unveiling a $912 million investment in U.S. manufacturing on Tuesday, per Automotive News: With a toothy grin, “Make America Great Again” hat and Trump-Vance T-shirt, Akio Toyoda hosted a star-spangled, barbecued, all-American, NASCAR spectacle at Fuji Speedway in a new charm offensive aimed not only at motorsports fans and diplomats, but possibly also U.S. tariffs. Against the backdrop of global trade tensions, the Toyota Motor Corp. chairman billed the extravaganza, held in conjunction with an endurance race at the Toyota-owned circuit, as an international celebration of car culture and proof of Japan’s love for Motown metal. U.S. Ambassador George Glass accompanied the charismatic Toyota front man at the Nov. 16 event, which showcased a demonstration run of six NASCAR machines specially shipped over for the occasion, with a clutch of star drivers to wow the American flag-waving crowd. Prior to the vent, Toyoda said that he understands that countries use tariffs to protect certain industries but cautioned business leaders to remember consumers. “I’m not here to argue whether tariffs are good or bad. Every national leader wants to protect their own auto industry,” Toyoda said. “We are exploring ways to make tariffs a winner for everyone. The people we want most to be winners are our customers.” As noted by the New York Post, Japan is “facing a roughly 15% baseline tariff on auto imports, slashed down from 27.5% as part of a trade agreement in September.” Paul Roland Bois directed the award-winning Christian tech thriller, EXEMPLUM, which has a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic rating and can be viewed for FREE on YouTube, Tubi, or Fawesome TV. “Better than Killers of the Flower Moon,” wrote Mark Judge. “You haven’t seen a story like this before,” wrote Christian Toto.

"Trump's Canada envoy sees trade talks resuming after sudden halt Discussions between the longtime allies have been on ice since Ontario's ad campaign The U.S. ambassador in Ottawa said Canada and the U.S. have a chance to reach an agreement to reduce tariffs despite last month’s diplomatic blowup when U.S. President Donald Trump angrily halted negotiations. Until about a month ago, the two countries had been making progress on a limited deal to address certain trade frictions, Ambassador Pete Hoekstra told a conference of manufacturers in Ottawa on Wednesday. The talks will resume, he predicted, though he’s not sure when. “I’ve got suggestions that I think can get it restarted, but it’s not going to be easy,” he said. Discussions between the longtime allies have been on ice since Oct. 23, when Trump used his Truth Social platform to express his displeasure over a television ad campaign sponsored by the province of Ontario. The 60-second advertisement used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to make a case against tariffs. “Based on their egregious behaviour, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” wrote Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney said he asked the province not to run the ad, and later said he apologized to Trump. Hoekstra said Wednesday that Canada will have to accept that the days of duty-free trade between the North American neighbours are over. The two countries have enjoyed mostly tariff-free trade since the late 1980s, when Reagan and then-Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney struck a deal, the precursor to a wider North American accord that eventually included Mexico. “There will be a tariff, OK? The president has made it very, very clear,” Hoekstra said, adding that he has encouraged Canadian officials “just to really work closely with us” and “get into the lowest tariff bucket that the United States of America will have.” That might look something like the deal the White House struck with the U.K., the ambassador said. The Trump administration agreed earlier in the year to reduce tariffs on cars, steel and other U.K. products in return for more tariff-free access to the U.K. market. But the White House kept in place a baseline tariff of 10 per cent on most British goods, and getting the White House to follow through on lowering steel tariffs has been elusive so far. - Ottawa urged to pause its EV sales mandate - Trump hails McDonald's Extra Value Meals - Advertisement 1Story continues below For Canada, the economic risks of a lopsided trade deal are much higher than for the U.K. It exported about US$476 billion worth of goods and services to the U.S. last year, versus US$162 billion for the U.K. Canada is also the largest single U.S. customer, purchasing around US$440 billion from its neighbor last year, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

"The share of consumers taking out the riskiest form of loans has reached its highest peak this decade, a sign of growing financial stress for many Americans. The share of consumers taking on subprime loans accounted for 14.4% of borrowers in 2025’s third quarter, up from 13.9% from the same period in 2024 and the highest since 2019, according to a TransUnion report released Monday, which analyzes consumer credit data. About 25% of the U.S. population has a FICO credit score below 660, meaning they are subprime, according to Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk, citing data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The share of consumers in the subprime credit risk category fell during the pandemic as government stimulus helped many Americans pay down their debt. But as the subprime tier swells once more, it adds to signs that many are facing increased financial pressure: The percentage of subprime borrowers at least 60 days late on auto loan payments has reached 6.43%, double what it was in 2021, according to Fitch Ratings. Per property data firm ATTOM, August marked the sixth straight month of year-over-year rising home foreclosure filings. But the struggles of many borrowers don’t tell the full story. TransUnion also reported a growing share of super prime borrowers—which increased from 37.1% in 2019’s third quarter to 40.9% in the same period this year. The credit market has also expanded, growing the number of super prime borrowers by 16 million since 2019. These borrowers have higher credit scores and are likely to get more favorable loan terms, such as lower loan interest rates and higher credit limits. Additionally, consumer-level delinquencies declined seven basic points year over year to 2.37%, indicating strengthening consumer credit health, the report noted. “We are seeing a divergence in consumer credit risk, with more individuals moving toward either end of the credit risk spectrum,” Jason Laky, executive vice president and head of financial services for TransUnion, said in the report. “This shift suggests that while many consumers are navigating the current economic climate well, others may be facing financial strain.” Signs of a K-shaped economy Credit loan data aligns with what some economists are calling a K-shaped economy, one where higher-income earners are spending as they usually would on discretionary purchases like travel and premium goods, while lower-income earners cut back on dining out or trade down on purchases at the grocery store. “We’re sort of moving in the direction of two kinds of players in the economic market out there,” Lucia Dunn, sports and society research professor of economics at the Ohio State University, told Fortune. “I’m not so worried about the super prime category going into debt, maybe buying a Lamborghini instead of a Porsche.” Indeed, the Chicago Fed Advance Retail Trade Summary estimated retail sales excluding autos rose in September, building on 0.6% growth from July to August. Economists have attributed the strong growth indicators in the face of sustained tariff uncertainty and a beleaguered labor market to wealthier households continuing to spend, business as usual. A Moody’s analysis last month found the bottom 80% of earners spent in line with inflation since COVID, while the top 20% were responsible for economic growth. “We are losing the middle class,” Dunn said. “And when you get to a society where there are a lot of people at the bottom and then a small group at the top, that’s a prescription for real trouble.”",right
"As Switzerland closes in on a deal with the US to lower tariffs on the country, it will owe thanks to some of its richest executives who played a key role in wooing President Donald Trump. If the shuttle diplomacy of Switzerland’s top trade diplomat laid the groundwork for an agreement, crucial momentum was generated when businessmen led by billionaire figures from Richemont, Partners Group and Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. met Trump at the White House a week ago. The meeting, which also included Rolex Chief Executive Officer Jean-Frederic Dufour and Marwan Shakarchi, head of gold refiner and trader MKS PAMP Group, was like a gathering of old buddies, according to a person briefed on the encounter. That’s in sharp contrast to the heated conversation that took place between the US president and his Swiss counterpart at the end of July, after which Trump slapped Switzerland with the highest tariff of any developed country. Switzerland has since been engaged in efforts to reduce the levy, which stands at 39%. Bloomberg reported Monday that an agreement to cut it to 15% is close, and Trump said his administration is “working on a deal” to get it lower. The Billionaire Push The executives emphasized that they did not negotiate with Trump at the White House meeting, but their involvement reflects a deliberate Swiss pivot to leverage the strength of its business lobby. Their money and influence nudged Switzerland toward securing better terms. “It’s well known that Trump likes billionaires and business people, so this group isn’t surprising,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank. “The Swiss government has drawn a blank, so there was nothing to lose.” It’s a well worn path. Wealthy business people have been drafted in to lobby the US president on other issues, with Trump last month deciding against sending federal forces to San Francisco after calls with tech billionaires. The Swiss business leaders described their meeting with Trump as “highly constructive.” They raised the suffering of many companies in Switzerland and asked the US president if he thought the 39% import tariff was sustainable, according to the person briefed on the encounter, who asked not to be identified discussing the meeting. “Our discussions highlighted the strength of the private sector relationships that are a cornerstone of our bilateral cooperation and mutual prosperity,” the executives said in a statement. ‘New Dynamic’ Late last week, the Swiss Economic Affairs Department thanked Trump for a “great new dynamic in our bilateral relations.” But they also acknowledged the role played by the executives who included Alfred Gantner, co-founder of private equity firm Partners Group, and Johann Rupert, who leads luxury firm Richemont. Gantner owns 5% of Partners Group, which has a market value of 26 billion francs ($32.5 billion). The net worth of Rupert and his family stands at $17.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Five out of the six businessmen are from companies based in Geneva, highlighting the heft of Switzerland’s second city that’s home to private banks, commodity traders, watchmakers and luxury goods companies. The executives also bore gifts, including a gold Rolex clock and an engraved gold bar, according to media reports. “Trump is predominantly driven by one thing, which is personal gain,” said Kirkegaard. “The guy is a medieval prince, he needs to be buttered up. If it turns out to be private billionaires, then so be it.” Read More: Switzerland Moves Close to Securing Improved 15% Tariff Deal The warmth of the Oval Office meeting was far different to the frosty phone conversation between Trump and Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter just over three months ago. When Keller-Sutter pushed back on Trump’s view that Switzerland was responsible for the US losing $40 billion because of its goods trade surplus, the US president was frustrated that his concerns weren’t addressed. But following last week’s visit of what Trump called “high level Representatives of Switzerland,” he ordered US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to schedule follow-up negotiations. Those talks have now pushed Switzerland close to securing a 15% tariff on its exports to the US.",right

"President Donald Trump is adjusting his messaging strategy to win over voters who are worried about the cost of living with plans to emphasize new tax breaks and show progress on fighting inflation. The messaging is centered around affordability, and the push comes after inflation emerged as a major vulnerability for Trump and Republicans in Tuesday’s elections, in which voters overwhelmingly said the economy was their biggest concern. Democrats took advantage of concerns about affordability to run up huge margins in the New Jersey and Virginia governor races, flipping what had been a strength for Trump in the 2024 presidential election into a vulnerability going into next year’s midterm elections. White House officials and others familiar with their thinking requested anonymity to speak for this article in order to not get ahead of the president’s actions. They stressed that affordability has always been a priority for Trump, but the president plans to talk about it more, as he did Thursday when he announced that Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk would reduce the price of their anti-obesity drugs. “We are the ones that have done a great job on affordability, not the Democrats,” Trump said at an event in the Oval Office to announce the deal. “We just lost an election, they said, based on affordability. It’s a con job by the Democrats.” The White House is keeping up a steady drumbeat of posts on social media about prices and deals for Thanksgiving dinner staples at retailers such as Walmart, Lidl, Aldi and Target. “I don’t want to hear about the affordability, because right now, we’re much less,” Trump told reporters Thursday, arguing that things are much better for Americans with his party in charge. “The only problem is the Republicans don’t talk about it,” he said. The outlook for inflation is unclear As of now, the inflation outlook has worsened under Trump. Consumer prices in September increased at an annual rate of 3%, up from 2.3% in April, when the president first began to roll out substantial tariff hikes that suddenly burdened the economy with uncertainty. The AP Voter Poll showed the economy was the leading issue in Tuesday’s elections in New Jersey, Virginia, New York City and California. Grocery prices continue to climb, and recently, electricity bills have emerged as a new worry. At the same time, the pace of job gains has slowed, plunging 23% from the pace a year ago. The White House maintains a list of talking points about the economy, noting that the stock market has hit record highs multiple times and that the president is attracting foreign investment. Trump has emphasized that gasoline prices are coming down, and maintained that gasoline is averaging $2 a gallon, but AAA reported Thursday that the national average was $3.08, about two cents lower than a year ago. “Americans are paying less for essentials like gas and eggs, and today the Administration inked yet another drug pricing deal to deliver unprecedented health care savings for everyday Americans,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. Trump gets briefed about the economy by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other officials at least once a week and there are often daily discussions on tariffs, a senior White House official said, noting Trump is expected to do more domestic travel next year to make his case that he’s fixing affordability. But critics say it will be hard for Trump to turn around public perceptions on affordability. “He’s in real trouble and I think it’s bigger than just cost of living,” said Lindsay Owens, executive director of Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group. Owens noted that Trump has “lost his strength” as voters are increasingly doubtful about Trump’s economic leadership compared to Democrats, adding that the president doesn’t have the time to turn around public perceptions of him as he continues to pursue broad tariffs. New hype about income tax cuts ahead of April There will be new policies rolled out on affordability, a person familiar with the White House thinking said, declining to comment on what those would be. Trump on Thursday indicated there will be more deals coming on drug prices. Two other White House officials said messaging would change — but not policy. A big part of the administration’s response on affordability will be educating people ahead of tax season about the role of Trump’s income tax cuts in any refunds they receive in April, the person familiar with planning said. Those cuts were part of the sprawling bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July. This individual stressed that the key challenge is bringing prices down while simultaneously having wages increase, so that people can feel and see any progress. There’s also a bet that the economy will be in a healthier place in six months. With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s term ending in May, the White House anticipates the start of consistent cuts to the Fed’s benchmark interest rate. They expect inflation rates to cool and declines in the federal budget deficit to boost sentiment in the financial markets. But the U.S. economy seldom cooperates with a president’s intentions, a lesson learned most recently by Trump’s predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, who saw his popularity slump after inflation spiked to a four-decade high in June 2022. The Trump administration maintains it’s simply working through an inflation challenge inherited from Biden, but new economic research indicates Trump has created his own inflation challenge through tariffs. Since April, Harvard University economist Alberto Cavallo and his colleagues, Northwestern University’s Paola Llama and Universidad de San Andres’ Franco Vazquez, have been tracking the impact of the import taxes on consumer prices. In an October paper, the economists found that the inflation rate would have been drastically lower at 2.2%, had it not been for Trump’s tariffs. The administration maintains that tariffs have not contributed to inflation. They plan to make the case that the import taxes are helping the economy and dismiss criticisms of the import taxes as contributing to inflation as Democratic talking points. The fate of Trump’s country-by-country tariffs is currently being decided by the Supreme Court, where justices at a Wednesday hearing seemed dubious over the administration’s claims that tariffs were essentially regulations and could be levied by a president without congressional approval. Trump has maintained at times that foreign countries pay the tariffs and not U.S. citizens, a claim he backed away from slightly Thursday. “They might be paying something,” he said. “But when you take the overall impact, the Americans are gaining tremendously.” _____ Associated Press writers Will Weissert and Michelle L. Price contributed to this report.",right
"The oral argument on Nov. 5 for the Trump tariffs was fascinating as justices struggled with the knotty question of whether a president has the sweeping authority claimed by President Donald Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The justices were skeptical and uncomfortable with the claim of authority, and the odds still favored the challengers. However, there is a real chance of a fractured decision that could still produce an effective win for the administration. The counsel First, the counsel. I was highly impressed by the performance of Solicitor General John Sauer, who did a brilliant job in weaving historical and precedential arguments in favor of the tariffs. He had a tough case and at times a tough audience, but maintained a coherent and consistent position. Many were surprised that the challengers selected the liberal firebrand Neil Katyal for counsel on the other side. Kavanaugh even made a quip about the incongruity of Katyal arguing for issues like non-delegation. Katyal struggled at points and Justice Amy Coney Barrett bashed him once for seemingly flipping his position in oral argument. However, Katyal made the key points against the claim of statutory and constitutional authority. TRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER' Overall, the administration faced worrisome moments in the argument, with Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly referring to tariffs as a clear ""tax"" and Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raising the ""major questions doctrine."" Neither works well for the administration. If this is a tax, it is more likely viewed as a usurpation of Congress' inherent tax authority. The head count However, the head counting becomes more difficult as you comb through the specific questions of the justices. We begin with the clear votes in favor of the challengers by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Indeed, at times, both justices seemed to take on the role of counsel in clarifying the confusion left by the challengers and directing them back to what they viewed as more solid ground. SUPREME COURT TO WEIGH TRUMP TARIFF POWERS IN BLOCKBUSTER CASE Justice Elena Kagan, as usual, was more circumspect, but still clearly leaning against the administration. That leaves two more votes to reject the tariffs. The most obvious candidate would be Barrett, who hit Sauer hard with questions on the largely unprecedented scope of the Trump tariffs. Much of this turned on the meaning of the terms ""regulate importation"" in IEEPA. Barrett asked pointedly: ""Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase, together with ‘regulate importation,’ has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?"" Sauer stressed that a predecessor law was used in this manner, but Barrett repeatedly returned and was clearly not satisfied. At one point, Sotomayor (prematurely, in my view) snapped at Sauer and said, ""just answer the justice’s question."" TRUMP WARNS SUPREME COURT TARIFF SHOWDOWN IS 'LIFE OR DEATH' FOR AMERICA Nevertheless, Barrett offered the administration some hope in their questioning of the challengers. She zeroed in on the fact that licenses are within the power of the president: JUSTICE BARRETT: ""So, this license thing is important to me. And do you agree that pursuant to IEEPA, the president could impose — could regulate commerce by imposing a license fee?"" Katyal seemed to struggle with this when Barrett noted that he had previously stated there is little difference between a license and a tariff. Barrett said that, if so, a president could regulate commerce in the same way with a license fee. SUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY MR. KATYAL: ""Not a fee. So, I should have said this earlier. But license is different from a licensing fee. IEEPA and TWEA authorize licenses, not license fees. And no president has ever charged, to my knowledge, fees under those two statutes for the licenses. So, fee is impermissible. License is OK."" JUSTICE BARRETT: ""But I thought you conceded to Justice Gorsuch there was no difference between a tariff and a licensing fee functionally."" Nevertheless, Barrett offered the administration some hope in their questioning of the challengers. MR. KATYAL: ""Well, if the — if the licensing fee is just to — I didn't concede that."" JUSTICE BARRETT: ""OK."" Barrett kept telling Katyal that she was not following his arguments. Barrett also seemed intrigued by the incongruity that a president could use embargoes or quotas to effectively shut down trade entirely, so why shouldn't he be allowed to use the lesser of the powers? The fifth vote could come from Gorsuch, but again, the rationales were strikingly different from those of the other justices. Gorsuch clearly viewed the delegation of the authority as problematic and also raised the ""major questions doctrine."" However, he was also the most effective in hammering Katyal on plain meaning arguments, noting the verb ""regulate"" is ""capacious."" If Gorsuch were to argue that the delegation is unconstitutional, he may find himself in the minority, but could then give the president the statutory argument on the broad implications of ""regulate importation."" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Justice Brett Kavanaugh was the most useful for the administration in returning to the history of President Richard Nixon's global 10% tariff, under the Trading with the Enemy Act, the predecessor of IEEPA. Overall, the administration faced worrisome moments in the argument, with Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly referring to tariffs as a clear ""tax"" and Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raising the ""major questions doctrine."" He also highlighted how, in FEA v. Algonquin SNG (1976), the court allowed the exercise of tariff powers. At one point, he slammed Katyal's effort to rewrite the decision and said, ""Algonquin didn't have anything like that, but keep going."" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP There is a chance that the challengers could eke out a majority with Barrett and possibly another conservative, such as Gorsuch or Roberts. However, it is also possible that, when the justices delve into the details, they may find a fragmented rationale that ultimately works to the advantage of the administration. In the meantime, Congress may want to get started in addressing what Barrett described as ""the mess"" of reimbursement if the tariffs were found to be unlawful.",right
"Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said soon “real wages are going to increase,” which will ease the affordability issues. Host Brian Kilmeade said, “The whole thing from the off-year elections was affordability. That was the words people like Zohran Mamdani used but they’re the ways of solving that are very different from the way you would do it. So when you look at affordability now and you go grocery shopping, for example, what products are you working on bringing down? We know that certain products are down, certain up, like for example, coffee. The president says I’m going to lower the tariff rates on Brazil, Vietnam, and other places to try to bring the price of coffee down. What else do you do?” Bessent said, “Well, it’s tough to do a lot of specific things, but I can tell you, Brian, you’re going to see substantial announcement over the next couple of days in terms of things we don’t grow here in the United States, coffee being one of them, bananas, other fruits, things like that so that that will bring the prices down very quickly. And, Brian, we inherited this affordability mess. It was the worst inflation in 40 to 50 years, one of the worst in the nation’s history. And affordability has two components. So there’s the price level and then there is income level.” He continued, “And what happened under Biden was the cumulative inflation, stated inflation, CPI was 2,023% of what happened to working Americans. Their basket of goods and services, food, insurance, auto payments was up in the 30s, so they felt a real gigantic differential there. And what we are going to do is by bringing back high-paying manufacturing jobs, President Trump is going to do what he did in the first term, and that is for hourly workers and working Americans to have real wage increases.” Bessent added, “Brian, imagine two lines. There is the inflation line, we’ve got that under control. It’s leveled out. That is going to start turning down. Then there’s the income line, which under Biden, because so many of the jobs or government jobs, you can’t get real wage growth from a government job. Real wages are going to increase. And I would expect in the first quarter, second quarter of next year, those two lines are going to cross, and the American people are going to start feeling better. But look, this has been a tough period.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"The move comes as the US administration is facing domestic pressure over rising prices. The revised duty list includes products in which India has a strong export presence — black pepper, cloves, cumin, cardamom, turmeric, ginger, speciality teas, mango-based products, and selected nuts including cashew. According to TOI, India shipped more than $500 million worth of spices to the US in 2024, while tea and coffee exports were valued at close to $83 million. However, some of India’s largest agri-linked exports to the US, seafood such as shrimp and basmati rice, remain outside the exemption list. High tariffs also continue on Indian jewellery, apparel and gems until the two sides settle broader trade issues. As TOI noted, the US is still waiting for New Delhi to “turn off the Russian oil spigot and step up buying US energy.” Indian officials told TOI that processed foods worth an estimated $491 million last year are likely to gain the most. These include coffee and tea extracts, cocoa preparations, juices, fruit pulps, mango derivatives and vegetable waxes. Spices, valued at $359 million in exports last year, are next in line. Another 48 fruits and nuts, among them coconuts, guavas, mangoes, cashews, bananas, areca nuts and pineapples, are also covered, though their export value stands at about $55 million. The officials said the tariff relief will improve India’s position in the market. “These reductions will provide a level-playing field for these agri exports which were disadvantaged due to higher tariffs on India's exports vis-a-vis its competitors. Our products are well-placed to gain due to existing supplier credibility, established distribution networks, and strong diaspora-driven demand — factors that provide a competitive edge in the US,” an official told TOI. The rollback was issued through an executive order Trump signed on Friday, a step that follows increasing voter frustration over inflation and affordability concerns. The concern over rising prices contributed to Republican losses in recent byelections, TOI reported. Trump has also explored distributing $2,000 rebate checks funded through tariff revenue, and ordered a review of the meatpacking industry over price spikes. US trade groups and economists welcomed the tariff reduction, even as the president continued to insist prices have fallen. Critics have accused the administration of being out of touch with voters' financial pressures. As TOI quoted one commentator saying, “My budget and my reality are not on speaking terms anymore.” The tariff easing comes against the backdrop of the US president hosting a Gatsby-themed Halloween event at Mar-a-Lago and overseeing construction of a new ballroom. TOI noted that critics described it as part of a “gilded Oval Office” aesthetic, highlighting the contrast with concerns about everyday living costs.

"Large- and mid-caps continue to outperform small caps in earnings during the second quarter. Bigger companies are doing better because their earnings have stabilised, liquidity has improved, margins are protected and sectoral tailwinds are favourable. The same set of factors is dragging down the performance of small firms. The divergence is expected to persist in domestic cyclical themes, although earnings for both sets of companies are on track to benefit from a consumption boost following GST rate rationalisation. A rise in FPI selling is forcing the market to seek shelter in index heavyweights, and this compounds the challenges small firms are facing. Policy uncertainty and economic adversity affect companies differently according to their size. Large firms can fall back on scale, diversified revenues and access to capital when the chips are down. The global economy is not struggling unduly, but it is going through widespread uncertainty. Small companies also lack the capability to navigate trade fissures arising out of tariff and non-tariff barriers. Fortunately, India is reasonably insulated against trade shocks, and the economy can provide its small firms with a stable growth environment. This is supported by policy interventions to level the playing field for small companies, keeping their vulnerabilities in mind. Small caps saw their valuations surge to frothy levels before the ongoing correction. The process may not have run its full course yet. Investor sentiment for this segment is likely to recover gradually along with earnings momentum. The global macro headwinds confronting small firms will have to abate substantially for a sustainable recovery. Domestic policy support, while significant, may not fully offset the external drag.

"1. Unravelling of trade deals and diplomatic uncertainty The most immediate consequence of a ruling against the administration would be a forced dismantling of trade frameworks that were built upon the IEEPA-based tariff system. These reciprocal tariffs underpin several recent agreements with allies such as Japan and form the foundation of ongoing negotiations with major partners like China and India. If the court deems Trump’s emergency tariff authority unlawful, those deals could lose their legal and economic coherence. The administration would have to unwind or renegotiate terms, sowing confusion among trading partners and potentially disrupting the delicate equilibrium of U.S. trade diplomacy. Countries that accepted certain concessions or retaliatory limits in exchange for tariff relief might demand compensation or seek to renegotiate entirely. This uncertainty would not only affect formal trade partners but also unsettle global markets, which have adjusted to Trump’s protectionist framework. It could revive concerns about U.S. reliability in trade policy, a perception that has dogged Washington since the first wave of tariffs under Trump’s initial term. 2. The complex question of refunds to U.S. importers A second, and perhaps more administratively tangled, outcome involves the issue of refunds. Should the court rule that the tariffs were imposed illegally, U.S. importers who paid those duties would likely seek reimbursement. The issue of refunds was raised by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who said that it ""could be a mess"" for the courts to administer refunds to U.S. importers who have paid tariffs that were declared illegal. But Neal Katyal, the lawyer representing five small businesses challenging the tariffs, said the court ""could limit its decision to prospective relief"" by only stopping future collections. Joseph Spraragen, a customs lawyer in New York, told Reuters a ruling that includes no provisions for refunds would result in major new court challenges from companies that paid duties. ""If they're illegal today, they were illegal in February 2025 and in April, when the reciprocal tariffs kicked in,"" said Spraragen, a partner at the firm of Grunfeld Desiderio Lebowitz Silverman & Klestadt. He said the Supreme Court would likely remand the case to a lower court, most probably the U.S. Court of International Trade, to issue instructions to the Trump administration to rescind the tariffs and issue refunds. The most expedient method would be to issue refunds through the Customs and Border Protection's Automated Customs Environment processing system, he said, but that could take up to a year. ""Keep in mind that the administration is not going to be eager to just roll over and give refunds,"" Spraragen said. Either path, retroactive or prospective, would impose enormous administrative burdens and prolong uncertainty for businesses that have already raised prices or reduced staff because of the tariffs. 3. Trump resorts to other laws that may be less potent Even if the IEEPA route is struck down, the Trump administration has signalled that it would not abandon tariffs altogether. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters that he expects the Supreme Court to uphold the IEEPA-based tariffs. But if it strikes down the tariffs, Bessent said in an interview, the administration will simply switch to other tariff authorities, including Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows broad 15% tariffs for 150 days to calm trade imbalances. Bessent said Trump also can invoke Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, a statute that allows tariffs up to 50% on countries that discriminate against U.S. commerce. ""You should assume that they're here to stay,"" Bessent said of Trump's tariffs. The Supreme Court case covers only a portion of the tariffs Trump has imposed this year. His administration already is using other authorities for certain tariffs. He is busy piling up tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 involving national security concerns to protect strategic sectors including autos, copper, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, robotics and aircraft, as well as tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 involving unfair trade practices investigations. IEEPA's main advantage is its speed and seemingly broad scope, which suited Trump's desire to move quickly to impose tariffs within weeks of his January 20 inauguration through the use of executive orders. This avoided lengthy trade investigations and public comment periods under more traditional authorities for imposing tariffs through executive action, including the Section 301 unfair trade practices statute used to impose tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018 and 2019 and the Section 232 national security statute used for steel, aluminum and autos tariffs. 4. A weakened tariff hammer shrinks American negotiating power Even if Trump manages to sustain parts of his tariff regime through other authorities, the broader political and diplomatic impact of a court defeat would be unmistakable. The loss would signal judicial resistance to the broadest interpretation of presidential emergency powers in economic policy. This, in turn, would blunt one of Trump’s most potent foreign policy tools - his ability to use tariffs as leverage in negotiations. Without the threat of sudden, sweeping tariffs, the United States’ bargaining power with major trading partners would likely decline. Countries such as China and India, already pursuing tough negotiation strategies, could exploit this weakened position to extract greater concessions from the US. At home, the perception of diminished presidential authority could also reshape congressional-executive relations. Lawmakers who have long criticised Trump’s unilateral trade maneuvers may push for tighter legislative oversight of tariff powers, potentially leading to a more constrained and rules-based trade environment.

"The markets are volatile—and Wall Street’s most reliable barometer of panic has surged to levels not seen since April, when President Donald Trump’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs triggered a global market meltdown. The Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, peaked at 27.8 on Thursday and closed the day around 26.3—its highest point since the tariff crisis sent it soaring above 50 earlier this year. The previous high, apart from April’s tariff-induced spike, was struck around mid-October when the VIX reached 25.31. The latest increase represents a 50% jump in November alone, marking only the 11th month in history the fear gauge has risen that dramatically. On Friday, the VIX remained elevated but slipped 4% to 25.30. Of tariffs and tech valuations The VIX, for those unfamiliar, measures expected 30-day volatility in S&P 500 options, essentially tracking how much investors will pay to protect against market swings. Readings above 20 signal heightened anxiety; readings above 40 often mark crisis points. On April 8, the VIX peaked at 52.33 after Trump’s tariff announcement sent global markets into free fall. Thursday’s spike stemmed from different issues. Wall Street is growing concerned about stock valuations, particularly among U.S. tech giants, as several firms are trading at price-to-earnings multiples last seen during the early 2000s dotcom bubble. Even Nvidia’s blockbuster earnings couldn’t calm nerves, as investors questioned whether AI-fueled gains had outpaced reality. The Federal Reserve has added to the uncertainty. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s recent statements suggest a pause in rate cuts. This shift removed a key support for risk assets that had helped markets rally 42% from their April lows. After money markets priced in just a 40% chance of a December reduction, they now see 73% odds of one, helped by dovish comments from New York Fed President John Williams. A short-lived scare? To be clear, extreme VIX spikes rarely last. The April tariff crisis saw the VIX drop from above 50 to below 20 in less than 100 days—one of only four such rapid declines in history. Data shows that when the VIX jumps more than 50% in a month, the S&P 500 typically struggles initially but posts average gains of nearly 9.5% a year later, exceeding the historical annualized average of around 8%. Still, the current environment differs from spring’s tariff scare. Then, markets crashed on a specific policy announcement. Now, investors face a confluence of broader industry trends and economic anxieties, including persistent concerns about an AI valuation bubble, monetary policy adjustments, and escalating geopolitical tensions. For long-term investors, these spikes often create opportunity. But buying the dip can be a dangerous sport. The market must first find its footing in a landscape where tech valuations, interest rates, and geopolitical risks are creating a “perfect storm” of uncertainty.

"Aluminum producer adds markups as Trump tariffs drive up consumer costs Trump set aluminum tariffs at 25 per cent, then doubled the rate, in what he said is an effort to protect American industry Rio Tinto Group is imposing surcharges on aluminum shipments it sells to the United States, a move that threatens to further disrupt a North American market already roiled by import tariffs that are driving up costs for consumers. The Anglo-Australian mining giant is including the extra charge on aluminum orders delivered to the U.S. citing low inventories, as demand starts to outstrip available supply, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The U.S. relies heavily on foreign aluminum supplies as it doesn’t have the capacity to produce enough to meet demand. Canada is its No. 1 foreign supplier, accounting for more than 50 per cent of U.S. imports. The surcharge adds stress to an already extremely constrained U.S. market after president Donald Trump earlier this year imposed a 50 per cent import tariff on the lightweight metal, which is used in everything from soda cans to construction. Tariffs made Canadian shipments too expensive for American metal fabricators and consumers. Instead they’ve drawn on domestic stockpiles and exchange warehouses, leading supplies to dwindle and prices to jump. The latest markup amounts to a charge on top of a charge, since U.S. aluminum prices already include the so-called Midwest premium — an added cost above the London benchmark price that reflects transportation, storage, insurance and financing — to deliver the metal into the American marketplace. Each global region has its own premium, which is usually set by pricing reporting agencies. The new surcharge ranges from one to three cents above the Midwest premium, said the people familiar, who asked to not be identified discussing private contract details. Though that’s a modest amount, the markups plus the Midwest premium translate into an extra US$2,006 per ton on top of the raw metal price of about US$2,830, implying a more than 70 per cent premium. That’s above Trump’s 50 per cent import duty. Consumers and traders describe a market that’s all but broken, with the surcharge the clearest sign yet of how deeply its structure has been disrupted by Trump’s levies. The price for aluminum delivered to the U.S., including the benchmark price and the Midwest premium, reached a record high last week as stockpiles shrink. - Canadian aluminum floods Europe as U.S. tariffs bite - Carney announces new measures to protect Canada's steel and aluminum industries - Advertisement 1Story continues below It’s “a new reality now that if the U.S. wants to attract aluminum units, it has to pay up because the U.S. is not the only market that actually is short,” said Michael Widmer, head of metals research at Bank of America Corp. Rio Tinto declined to comment. The head of the Aluminium Association of Canada, Jean Simard, explained that buyers asking for payment terms on contracts beyond 30 days should expect a premium to offset higher costs of financing for producers. “The 50 per cent tariff on aluminum put in place by the U.S. administration significantly increased the risk of holding aluminum inventory in the U.S. as any tariff change could directly impact the economics of cash-and-carry inventory financing trades,” Simard said. In Europe, which is also a net importer of aluminum, the regional premium has dropped about five per cent from a year ago. But it has been recovering in recent weeks amid supply outages and the implementation next year of a European Union fee on imports based on greenhouse gases emitted during their production, according to Morgan Stanley analysts including Amy Gower. The analysts expect the current global backdrop to take the global benchmark above US$3,000 a metric ton. Trump set aluminum tariffs at 25 per cent in February and doubled the rate in June in what he said is an effort to protect American industry. U.S. importers turned to domestic supplies to try and evade paying the steep import tax. U.S. warehouses used by the London Metal Exchange, the biggest global market for metals trading, don’t have any aluminum left after the last 125 tons were withdrawn in October. Exchange inventory typically serves as the last resort for physical supply. Top U.S. aluminum producer Alcoa said during its third-quarter earnings call that domestic stockpiles stood at only 35 days of consumption, a level that typically triggers higher pricing. Before the recent price increase, aluminum producers in Quebec had been sending more of the metal to Europe to compensate for the loss-making U.S. market. Quebec represents about 90 per cent of Canada’s aluminum-making capacity, with the U.S. as the province’s natural buyer given the close proximity. The tightness in the U.S. market has been exacerbated by language in the presidential proclamations that says aluminum tariffs won’t apply to imported products if the metal was smelted and cast in the U.S. That’s created more demand for U.S.-made aluminum from overseas manufacturers, who use it to make products that are then shipped to the U.S. duty-free. “If you are a net importer of aluminum units, and you’re putting a tariff on those imports, ultimately, it’s not the supplier who pays — it’s the consumers, hands down,” said Bank of America’s Widmer. —With assistance from Mathieu Dion.

"Canada adds surprise 67,000 jobs in October, unemployment rate drops to 6.9% OTTAWA — Canada’s labour market caught economists off guard with a second straight month of surprise job gains in October. Statistics Canada said Friday the economy added 67,000 jobs in October, good enough to drive the unemployment rate down two tenths of a percentage point to 6.9 per cent. October’s growth was driven by part-time work with 85,000 positions added, coming off solid gains in full-time work in September. The private sector meanwhile added 73,000 jobs for its first gain since June. Economists polled by Reuters ahead of Friday’s release expected Canada’s labour market would take a breather with a loss of 2,500 jobs in October, following a surprise gain of 60,000 positions in September. Job gains across October and September now more than offset sharp drops observed in August and July. The wholesale and retail trade sector saw the most growth with 41,000 positions added in October, followed by transportation and warehousing with 30,000 jobs and the information, culture and recreation sector with 25,000 roles. Tariff-sensitive manufacturing posted a gain of 8,700 positions in October while construction lost 15,000 jobs. StatCan said goods-producing industries have shed 54,000 positions on net since January — when uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs and global trade started to ramp up — while the services side of the economy had added 142,000 jobs over that time. Ontario, a province hit hard by the trade war, led job growth provincially with 55,000 positions added. Manufacturing-heavy Windsor’s unemployment rate peaked at 11.2 per cent in June but has since trended down to 9.6 per cent, according to three-month moving averages. Young workers saw some relief in October after struggling for months in a tough labour market as youth aged 15 to 24 saw 21,000 jobs added last month, the first gain since January. That drove the youth jobless rate down 0.6 percentage points to 14.1 per cent in October after reaching a 15-year high in September, outside the pandemic. Average hourly wages were up 3.5 per cent annually in October, accelerating from 3.3 per cent the month before. The Bank of Canada will be parsing labour data closely as it prepares for its final interest rate decision of the year on Dec. 10, though the central bank will also get a look at November’s jobs figures before making that call. The bank’s benchmark interest rate stands at 2.25 per cent following a pair of consecutive cuts. Governor Tiff Macklem signalled last month that the central bank may be satisfied with where the benchmark interest rate stands unless incoming economic data strays from its forecasts.

"Trump says the government has collected “hundreds of billions” from tariffs and should return some of that money to families struggling with high costs. The promise created immediate buzz because Americans are still fighting high grocery bills, rising insurance premiums, and expensive housing. A $2,000 boost feels meaningful, especially for households being squeezed month to month. But the math tells a different story — one that’s hard to ignore. Tariffs are projected to generate about $158.4 billion in 2025 and more than $207 billion in 2026, but even the smallest version of the rebate program would cost far more. A model that covers only tax filers and spouses with incomes under a certain level would still need nearly $280 billion, leaving a huge funding gap. A broader version that includes non-filers and dependents jumps to over $600 billion, almost double the projected revenue for the next two years combined. The math simply does not balance, and the funds have already been counted to offset other tax and spending measures. Every scenario ends with the same problem: the government would be spending money it doesn’t actually have. Then comes the political reality. The checks would require congressional approval, and that’s where support collapses even further. Lawmakers worried about the national debt — now above $38 trillion — are unlikely to approve a massive new spending program at a time when federal finances are under pressure. And many who previously argued that big federal checks fueled the price surge a few years ago would have to reverse themselves publicly to support the plan. With rising interest rates and intense scrutiny on federal spending, the votes simply aren’t there. Even if Congress said yes, the economic risks add another layer of uncertainty. Large direct payments can push spending higher in an economy still battling elevated prices. Some people would use the money responsibly, but many would spend it immediately, adding pressure where supply is already tight. More demand with limited supply means higher prices, which threatens the progress made against inflation. Economists warn that checks could undo that progress and trigger new rounds of price pain for consumers who can’t afford any more shocks. There’s also a market risk: big spending can make investors nervous. When that happens, they demand higher yields to buy government bonds. And when yields rise, mortgages, car loans, and small-business borrowing all become more expensive. The relief that checks provide could be wiped out quickly by rising borrowing costs. Short-term cash could create long-term pain. And all of this assumes the funding survives the courts. A major legal battle is underway over whether certain tariffs were imposed using powers that were stretched too far. If the courts strike down those tariffs, as much as 75% of the expected revenue could vanish. That would instantly collapse the financial foundation of the rebate program. No revenue, no checks — even if politics and inflation concerns suddenly disappeared. So what would it actually take for $2,000 checks to become real? The answer is unsettling. Experts say the only scenario that could force the government to move quickly is a clear sign of economic trouble — rising unemployment, weakening hiring, or the early stages of a recession. Direct payments are traditionally treated as “break-the-glass” emergency tools, used only when policymakers need to stabilize the economy fast. In other words, the checks might only appear if conditions worsen enough that avoiding a recession becomes the priority. That means the arrival of the payments would be a sign that things are going wrong, not that financial relief is simply arriving on schedule. For now, the obstacles remain steep, the numbers remain stubborn, and the political climate remains divided. The promise of $2,000 checks may grab attention, but the reality behind it tells a far tougher story. Why the Math doesn’t add up for $2,000 checks The biggest obstacle is the money itself. Trump’s new tariffs are expected to bring in a large amount of revenue, but not nearly enough to cover the cost of sending checks to millions of Americans. Tariffs may sound like a bottomless pot of cash, but they come with limits.Even a narrow version of the payments — only for tax filers and spouses making under a certain income — would require far more money than the tariffs are projected to generate next year. A broader program that covers non-filers and dependents grows even more expensive, to the point where the government would be spending double the amount it takes in. This creates a gap that cannot be ignored. The government cannot spend hundreds of billions more than it collects just because the idea is popular. And with a federal budget already stretched thin, that gap becomes a major roadblock. The biggest issue is that tariff revenue has already been counted in other financial plans. It has been presented as a way to help offset earlier tax and spending measures. Using the same money again for rebate checks would double-count dollars that don’t actually exist. In simple terms: the numbers don’t line up. And unless real money appears, the checks remain more promise than plan. Would Congress actually approve these checks? Even if the White House wants these checks, they cannot simply be issued automatically. Congress has to approve the payments, and that is where another huge obstacle appears.Many lawmakers who worry about the national debt have already been uneasy about large spending packages. Asking them to support another massive program — potentially costing hundreds of billions — is a heavy lift. The national debt recently crossed $38 trillion, and it continues to climb. That puts added pressure on lawmakers who are already concerned about overspending. There’s also the political memory factor. A lot of leaders previously argued that large direct payments contributed to the inflation surge a few years ago. Supporting new checks now could make them appear inconsistent, something politicians generally avoid. This combination of debt worries and political hesitation makes approval uncertain at best. Without strong support from both parties, the checks do not move forward. The bottom line: the votes simply might not be there, especially when the cost is this large and the timing is this sensitive. Could $2,000 checks push prices even higher? Another major question is inflation. Many economists warn that sending out big checks while prices are still elevated could create new problems.Some people would use the money to pay bills or reduce debt. But many others would spend it quickly on essentials. That creates extra demand in an economy where supply is already struggling to keep up. And when demand rises without supply catching up, prices go up. This is one of the main reasons economists are cautious. A big round of direct payments could undo the recent progress on inflation. The country has already experienced the cycle of stimulus checks boosting spending and then pushing prices higher. Even some voices who normally support tax relief say direct checks are the wrong tool. They argue that if tariff revenue exists, it should be used for tax cuts instead of cash payments, which they believe would help families without creating sudden spikes in spending. There’s also the financial market angle. Large government spending can make bond investors nervous. When that happens, interest rates rise. Higher interest rates make mortgages, car loans, and business loans more expensive. All of this makes direct checks a risky move. A short-term boost could become a long-term cost. Could legal rulings wipe out the funding altogether? There is another obstacle that doesn’t get as much attention: the courts.A major legal case is examining whether certain tariffs were put in place using powers that were stretched too far. If the courts rule against the government, a huge portion of tariff revenue could vanish overnight. That would instantly wipe out the funding source for the checks. No revenue means no rebates, no matter how much political support exists. This legal uncertainty adds another layer to the puzzle. A plan built on revenue that might disappear is difficult to defend or pass. So even if every other barrier were overcome, the legal risk alone could stall the entire idea. Is there any scenario where the $2,000 checks actually happen? There is one possibility — but it’s not a good one.If the economy suddenly weakens, if the job market cracks, or if unemployment rises sharply, the government may consider emergency measures. Direct payments are often used as “break-the-glass” tools during crises. They help stabilize the economy quickly by supporting households and boosting spending. In other words, the checks might become real only if the country is in trouble. This means the arrival of the payments would signal deeper problems — not a strong economy. For most experts, this is the one scenario where Congress and the White House may move quickly and align behind a large program. But it’s also the one scenario most Americans hope to avoid.

"Putin's visit highlights Indian imports of discounted Russian oil in the face of US sanctions NEW DELHI (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin will be in India this week for a summit aimed at deepening economic, defense and energy ties, a visit that will also test New Delhi’s efforts to balance relations with Moscow and Washington as the war in Ukraine grinds on. Putin is scheduled to arrive on the state visit Thursday and hold talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. They are expected to review progress on bilateral ties, discuss issues of mutual interest and sign interdepartmental and business agreements, both governments said. India has continued to buy discounted Russian oil, despite warnings from Washington that this is partly keeping Moscow’s revenues afloat to fund the Ukraine war. U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed additional 25% tariffs on Indian imports, raising the total duties to 50%, in retaliation. India has defended its imports as essential for meeting the growing energy needs of its 1.4 billion people. Putin last visited India in 2021. Modi was in Moscow last year, and the two leaders briefly met in September in China during a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. The pivotal diplomatic moment The India-Russia summit comes as the United States renews its push for a Ukraine peace plan and seeks broader cooperation from key partners. Putin met U.S. presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner in the Kremlin Tuesday to discuss the proposals, which critics have described as too heavily tilted toward Moscow. Yuri Ushakov, one of Putin’s senior advisers, told journalists after the meeting that talks had been “productive” but said that much work still remained. Modi has avoided condemning Russia for the fighting in Ukraine while emphasizing the need for a peaceful settlement. Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, an international affairs expert at the Jindal School of International Affairs near New Delhi, said India has avoided taking on an overt mediating role because it could complicate its ties with both Russia and the U.S. “But behind-the-scenes diplomacy by Modi is feasible, and has happened already to some extent,” Chaulia said. Modi could try to nudge Putin “to accommodate some Ukrainian and European concerns to bring about a cessation of hostilities,” he added. Economic cooperation key focus of Putin’s visit India and Russia will look at bolstering their bilateral relationship and are expected to deliver a package of documents centered around economic cooperation, trade facilitation, maritime, healthcare and media exchanges, according to Indian officials involved in the summit’s preparation. They spoke on condition of anonymity as the details aren’t public. India is keen to increase exports of pharmaceuticals, agriculture and textiles to Russia and is seeking the removal of non-tariff barriers. New Delhi is also seeking long-term supplies of fertilizers from Moscow. Another key area where the two countries are working to finalize an agreement is the safe and regulated migration of Indian skilled workers to Russia. U.S. pressure on India to shun Russian oil The U.S. has pressed India to halt purchases of discounted Russian oil, accusing New Delhi of helping fund Moscow’s war effort. In August, Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Indian imports to increase pressure over the issue. India rejected the charge, saying it follows international sanctions and prioritizes its national interest and energy security. But its position could become more complicated after new U.S. sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil. Indian officials said the country will avoid buying oil from sanctioned producers, while keeping options open with companies not targeted by the restrictions. “India will certainly underscore that there is no Indian desire to cut off energy supplies from Russia completely,” said Harsh Pant, vice president of foreign policy at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. Pant said future imports will depend “on the market forces and how effective sanctions are in weaning away Indian private sector or Indian state-run companies from Russian energy sources.” Energy cooperation is expected to feature prominently at the summit, including India’s investments in Russia’s Far East and expanded civil nuclear collaboration. The Kudankulam nuclear power plant in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, built with Russian assistance, remains the centerpiece of that partnership, and officials said talks continue on localized equipment manufacturing and potential joint projects in third countries. Defense cooperation at the core India is expected to push Russia for faster delivery of two further S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, after receiving three under a 2018 deal worth about $5.4 billion. The delay has been tied to supply chain disruptions linked to the war in Ukraine. Indian authorities are also likely to explore the possibility of acquiring additional S-400 units or an upgraded variant, though no contract or announcement is expected. Indian defense planners say the S-400 proved effective during a brief military standoff with Pakistan in May. “The meeting will focus on broader elements of institutional cooperation on defense between our two sides and will try to ensure that delivery delays are ended. Potentially, S-400 additional is not ruled out, but don’t expect any announcement during the visit,” India’s Defense Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said at a security conference in New Delhi last week. Talks are also expected on upgrading India’s Russian-made Su-30MKI fighter jets and accelerating deliveries of critical military hardware, as well as improving coordination on joint exercises and disaster relief. Despite India diversifying its procurement of military hardware over the last few years, Russia continues to be its biggest supplier. Moscow is keen on selling its stealth fighter jet Su-57 to India, but New Delhi has kept its options open to other foreign suppliers as well.

"A tax on tea once sparked rebellion. This time, it’s just causing headaches. Importers of the prized leaves have watched costs climb, orders stall and margins shrink under the weight of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Now, even after Trump has given them a reprieve, tea traders say it won’t immediately undo the damage. “It took a while to work its way through the system, these tariffs, and it will take a while for it to work its way out of the system,” says Bruce Richardson, a celebrated tea master, tea historian and purveyor of teas at his shop, Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, in Danville, Kentucky. “That tariffed tea is still working its way out of our warehouses.” While a handful of bigger firms are behind the biggest supermarket brands, the premium tea market is largely the work of smaller businesses, from family farms to specialty importers to a web of little tea shops, tea rooms and tea cafes across the U.S. Amid an onslaught of tariffs, they have become showcases for the levies’ effects. On their shelves, selection has narrowed, with some teas now missing because they’re no longer viable products to stock with steep levies on top. In their warehouses, managers are consumed with uncertainty and operational headaches, including calculating what a blend really costs, with ingredients from multiple countries on a roller coaster of tariffs. And in backrooms where the wafting scent of fresh tea permeates, owners have been forced to put off job postings, raises, advertising and other investments so they can have cash available to pay duties when their containers arrive at U.S. ports. “If I were to add up all the money I’ve spent on tariffs that weren’t there a year ago, it could equal a new employee,” says Hartley Johnson, who owns the Mark T. Wendell Tea Company in Acton, Massachusetts. Johnson’s prices used to stay static for a year or longer. He ate the tariff costs before being forced to respond. His most popular tea, a smoky Taiwanese one called Hu-Kwa, has steadily risen from $26 to $46 a pound. He knows some customers are reconsidering. “Where is that tipping point?” Johnson asks. “I’m kind of finding that tipping point is happening now.” Though Trump backed off some tariffs on agricultural products last week, many in the tea trade are wary of celebrating too soon and caution tea drinkers shouldn’t either. Much of next year’s supply has already been imported and tariffed and the full impact of those duties may not have fully spilled downhill. Meantime, other tariff-driven price hikes persist. All sorts of other products tea businesses import, from teapots to infusers, remain subject to levies, and costs for some American-made items, like tins for packaging, have spiked because they rely on foreign materials. “The canisters, the bamboo boxes, the matcha whisks, everything that we import, everything that we sell has been affected by tariffs,” says Gilbert Tsang, owner of MEM Tea Imports in Wakefield, Massachusetts. Though globally, tea reigns supreme, imbibed more than anything but water, it has long been overshadowed by coffee in the U.S. Still, tea is entwined in American history from the very beginning, even before colonists angry with tariffs dumped tons of it in Boston Harbor. Boston may run on Dunkin’ today, but it was born on tea. The 1773 revolt that became known as the Boston Tea Party rose out of the British Parliament’s implementation of tea tariffs on colonists, who rejected taxation without representation in government. After an independent United States was born, one of the new government’s first major acts, the Tariff Act of 1789, ironically set in law import taxes on a range of products including tea. In time, though, trade policy came to include carve-outs for many products Americans rely on but don’t produce. For more than 150 years, most tea has passed through U.S. ports with little to no duties. That began to change in Trump’s first term with his hardline approach to China. But nothing compared to what came with his return to the White House. In July, the most recent month for which the U.S. International Trade Commission has tallied tariff numbers, tea was taxed at an average rate of over 12%, a huge increase from a year earlier when it was just under one-tenth of a percent. In that single month, American businesses and consumers paid more than $6 million in tea import taxes, amassing in just 31 days more tariffs than any previous full year on record. “All over again, taxation without representation,” says Richardson, an adviser to the Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum. “Our wants and needs and our voices are not being represented because Congress is avoiding the issue by simply allowing the president to act like George III.” All told, tea importers paid about $19.6 million in tariffs in the first seven months of 2025, nearly seven times as much as the same period last year. It’s all been confounding to those steeped in the world of tea, on which the U.S. depends on foreign countries for nearly all of the billions of pounds Americans brew each year. Though a number of small tea farms exist in the U.S., they can’t fill Americans’ cups for more than a few hours of the year. “We don’t have an industry and we can’t produce one overnight,” says Angela McDonald, president of the United States League of Tea Growers. Trump’s suspension of tea tariffs came too late for some businesses, including Los Angeles-based International Tea Importers Inc., for which tariffs created an untenable cash-flow crunch. “We just became over-leveraged financing not just the inventory, but also the tariffs,” says the company’s CEO, Brendan Shah. Tariffs weren’t the only thing the 35-year-old business was facing, but without them, Shah says it may have survived. “Unpredictable tariff policies,” he wrote to customers in announcing the company’s closure, “have created the final, insurmountable barrier.”",right
"A sweeping new analysis of tariff policy spanning 150 years suggests that the economic establishment may have fundamentally misunderstood how tariffs affect prices and employment, a finding with profound implications for understanding President Donald Trump’s trade policy and the proper response by the Federal Reserve. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco examined major tariff changes from 1870 through 2020 across the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Their conclusion challenges the conventional wisdom that dominated economic policy debates in recent years: when countries raise tariffs, prices actually fall, not rise. “We find that a tariff hike raises unemployment and lowers inflation,” the authors, Régis Barnichon and Aayush Singh, write in their working paper released this month.”This goes against the predictions of standard models, whereby CPI inflation should go up in response to higher tariffs.” The finding arrives at a politically charged moment. As the Trump administration has implemented tariff increases averaging 18 percent on U.S. imports in 2025, mainstream economists warned of a significant inflationary spiral. The Federal Reserve officials have repeatedly said they have hesitated to cut interest rates because they expect tariffs to push up prices. More recently, several Fed officials have said that they think the central bank should not cut interest rates further due to what they believed would be inflationary pressures from tariffs. But the historical evidence suggests those concerns may have rested on shaky theoretical foundations not backed by evidence. The Tarifflation Story Was Upside Down The researchers’ approach was ingenious. Rather than trying to parse recent decades of limited tariff variation, they exploited massive swings in tariff policy across centuries, using these shifts as a natural experiment to understand cause and effect. The key insight came from American political history. Throughout the 19th century and into the 1930s, Republicans and Democrats held fundamentally opposite views about tariffs. Republicans, representing industrial interests in the North, favored high tariffs for protection. Democrats, representing the agricultural South, opposed them as harmful to farmers and consumers. This partisan divide created something economists rarely find: quasi-random variation in policy. When recessions hit, the political response to higher unemployment depended on which party was in power—not on any consistent economic logic. Republicans would raise tariffs to protect their constituents. Democrats would lower them for the same reason. “Since recessions did not favor one party over another, there was no general relation between the direction of tariff changes and the state of the economy,” the authors explain. This meant they could use straightforward statistical methods to isolate tariff effects, without worrying that policy makers were adjusting tariffs in response to economic conditions. They also identified eight major tariff changes explicitly motivated by long-term political considerations rather than cyclical pressures—from the McKinley Tariff of 1890 to the recent Trump tariffs of 2018—and analyzed those separately. Both approaches yielded the same surprising result. The Inflation Puzzle Using a standard economic model, researchers estimated the effect of tariff shocks on inflation and unemployment. A roughly 4 percentage point increase in average tariffs lowered inflation by about 2 percentage points while raising unemployment by about 1 percentage point, they found. The results held across different time periods. Whether examining the first wave of globalization before 1913, the interwar period, or the modern post-World War II era, the pattern remained consistent: higher tariffs correlated with lower prices and weaker economic activity. This pattern contradicts standard economic theory, which predicts that tariffs should raise business costs and lead to higher consumer prices. Instead, the researchers observe tariff increases associated with both lower inflation and higher unemployment, a combination the authors say more consistent with a negative demand shock than a supply-side cost increase. “These findings point towards tariff shocks acting through an aggregate demand channel,” the authors conclude. However, the researchers do not identify the specific mechanism. They note that when tariffs “appear to act as aggregate demand shocks.” When tariffs increased, stock prices fell and market volatility spiked, which could reflect uncertainty dampening economic sentiment. They also note that tariffs could depress asset prices, which could then depress demand. But they stop short of proving this is what actually happens. “We provide suggestive evidence that an aggregate demand channel can be at play, but an important avenue for future research is to understand the theoretical reasons for these surprising yet robust findings, which are central to the appropriate monetary response to tariff shocks,” the economists write. Alternative explanations remain plausible: tariffs could strengthen domestic workers’ bargaining power, raising wages and reducing firms’ hiring at the margin, while foreign competitors simultaneously cut prices to maintain market share. A Reconsideration of Trade Theory The paper’s findings overturn decades of consensus among mainstream economists about tariff effects. Trade theory has long held that tariffs are economically inefficient, raising consumer prices while reducing overall prosperity. Yet this study of 150 years of actual tariff episodes suggests the real-world effects are far more complex than textbook models suggest. The research suggests that tariff shocks operate primarily through aggregate demand mechanisms rather than through the simple cost-push mechanism that trade models emphasize. This distinction matters enormously. It means that tariffs can be used as a policy tool without triggering the consumer price spirals that economists have warned about for generations. Although, even here, the results are merely suggestive. It’s not clear from the research why tariffs push down inflation and employment, only that they do. The study’s authors note the surprising scarcity of rigorous empirical research on tariff effects. “There is surprisingly little empirical evidence on the aggregate macroeconomic effects of tariff changes,” they observe, “with most studies focused on partial equilibrium effects.” By grounding their analysis in historical evidence rather than theoretical assumptions, Barnichon and Singh have forced a reckoning with how much the policy consensus rested on untested premises. “The results are more uncertain” in the modern period, the authors acknowledge, because tariff variation has been so limited since World War II. But the point estimates still point in the same direction: higher tariffs are associated with lower inflation and weaker activity. A Challenge to the Establishment Consensus The paper comes at a moment when the economic consensus faces increasing scrutiny. For decades, mainstream economists have dominated policy debates, and their models—which predicted significant consumer price increases from 2025 tariff hikes—shaped expectations and Fed decisions. Yet the historical evidence suggests those models were wrong. The authors meticulously tested their findings against various alternative explanations and methodological approaches. Each time, the core result persisted: tariff increases lower inflation and raise unemployment. This consistency across centuries, countries, and identification strategies gives the findings substantial credibility. What emerges is a picture of tariffs far different from what opponents have typically portrayed. Rather than a crude tool that raises prices and harms consumers, tariffs appear to operate through sophisticated demand and supply mechanisms that reshape economic activity in ways economists are only beginning to understand. Tariffs in a New Light The findings reframe the debate over trade policy fundamentally. Long-term structural effects of tariffs may differ from short-run price and employment impacts, reorienting the economy towards more domestic production and less dependence on foreign manufacturers. A long-neglected idea known as optimal trade theory has long suggested that tariffs can be used by large economies to improve their terms of trade, forcing foreign producers to offer goods at lower prices. And tariffs may productively redistribute economic activity toward domestic industries and manufacturing sectors that economists might otherwise overlook. More importantly, the study removes the most potent intellectual weapon from the free-trade arsenal: the claim that tariffs inevitably raise consumer prices. For generations, this assertion ended policy debates before they could begin. Policymakers considering tariffs faced the accusation that they were imposing a regressive tax on consumers. Kamala Harris, in her failed bid for the presidency last year, repeatedly described Trump’s tariff proposals as a national sales tax that would increase consumer prices. Now that idea lies in tatters. With the consumer price argument dismantled, the debate over tariffs can proceed on grounds better rooted in economic history and national purpose. Policymakers can weigh the benefits of protecting domestic industries, rebalancing trade relationships, and rebuilding manufacturing capacity against the effects on economic activity and employment. They can consider whether tariffs might encourage productive investment and industrial development, questions that have been largely off-limits in mainstream economic discourse. The paper’s findings also call into question the Fed’s response to tariffs. If the main effects are lower inflation and higher lower employment, monetary theory would suggest that the Fed should cut interest rates when tariffs are imposed. Instead, the Fed this year took the opposite course, holding interest rates steady and only cutting hesitantly—moves that now look like a major policy mistake.

"NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has stopped accepting Russian crude for the export-oriented unit at its Jamnagar refining complex in Gujarat from Thursday, a day before the deadline for accepting pre-ordered shipments under the latest round of US sanctions and a month before EU curbs on products made from barrels from Kremlin-backed exporters. From December, all refined products exported from the unit in the Jamnagar SEZ (Special Economic Zone) will be derived from non-Russian oil, the operator of the worldâs largest refining complex in a single location said, indicating its compliance with the latest round of curbs on Russian oil or products made from those barrels. âThis transition has been completed ahead of schedule to ensure full compliance with product-import restrictions coming into force on 21 January 2026. The crude oil import in SEZ is a fully segregated facility catering to the production line in SEZ,â RIL said. The company will, however, accept Russian oil shipments contracted as of October 22 at its unit in the domestic tariff area (DTA), âconsidering all transport arrangements were already in place,â the company said. The final such cargo was loaded on November 12 and âcargoes arriving on or after November 21 will be received and processed at our refinery in the DTAâ¦ The transition has been completed ahead of schedule to ensure full compliance with product-import restrictions coming into force in January 2026,"" RIL said. RIL is the largest buyer of Russian crude in India and a big exporter of refined products to Europe. It has been scaling back purchase of Russian oil since the EU announced curbs on import of products made from those barrels and the US sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil, the companies accounting for nearly half of Russiaâs oil exports, setting a cut-off date of November 21 for accepting pre-ordered barrels for companies.",right
"In the wake of Washington DC and Seoul signing a joint factsheet meant to reset trade tensions and stop discriminatory treatment of U.S. tech companies in South Korea, a pair of powerful Korean officials are already signaling they may torpedo the entire agreement — all to advance burdensome, one-sided tech regulations that overwhelmingly target American firms while giving Korean and Chinese tech giants a free pass. According to Politico, the Trump Administration has privately warned Suth Korea that the U.S. is prepared to launch a Section 301 trade investigation if their government pushes ahead with these policies. Yet key Korean lawmakers and regulators appear ready to test Washington’s resolve. Kim Nam-geun, one of the most vocal champions of expanding Korean power over foreign tech companies, wasted no time openly rejecting the premise of the new bilateral understanding. Kim bragged that the agreement “does not prevent Seoul from tightening platform rules,” and pressed the government to “actively support renewed parliamentary debate” on sweeping new online-platform restrictions aimed squarely at U.S. companies. Kim even pointed to comments from leftist South Korean President Lee Jae-myung’s top policy advisor, Kim Yong-beom, who asserted that Korea’s domestic legislation “will not be hindered” by the trade factsheet — a statement that directly contradicts the spirit of the agreement and raises fresh doubts about Seoul’s good faith. Meanwhile, during a parliamentary hearing on November 17, a senior Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) official openly demanded new legislative authority to crack down on “dominant platforms” —just days after the factsheet was published. Breitbart News previously reported on the KFTC’s targeting of American tech companies. At the center of this aggressive posture is Korea’s new Fair Trade Commission Chairman, Ju Byung-ki, whose ideological hostility to American capitalism is well-documented. Shortly before assuming the helm of the KFTC, Ju published an essay titled “Trump’s Tariff War is a Trick to Cover Up the Disease of American Society.” In it, Ju launches a string of attacks on the Trump administration, including: - “The Trump administration’s tariff war is just a shallow trick to solve internal problems by covering the deep ills of American society and brushing the pockets of other countries and foreign companies.” - “Trump is using the energy of this anger politically. He chose an easy way to turn the arrow out— attacking external enemies—to rally supporters.” - “The cause of [Midwestern/white workers’] sense of deprivation is not beyond the border… The deepening income inequality and class gap over the past few decades are the real ‘enemies’ that made American society sick.” - “The negligence of globalization was focused on the financial capitalists of Wall Street and the technology elite of Silicon Valley.” - “Trump’s protectionism will cause a global economic recession.” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has warned that unfairly targeting U.S. tech companies “won’t be tolerated,” and “There is no good path forward where Korean regulations treat U.S. companies more restrictively,” than domestic firms. Industry estimates that Korea’s proposed platform regulation bills would impact $109B in total market revenues for U.S. companies, according to CCIA. The policies also impact American consumers. Research from Competere shows that Korea’s actions will cost $1 trillion in economic damage over the next 10 years, with the U.S. bearing the majority of that cost, resulting in American households losing roughly $3,800 each.

"Colombian clothing manufacturers are struggling to keep up with the unfair trading practices of the Chinese low-cost shopping apps Temu and Shein, the magazine Semana reported over the weekend. Sector representatives explained to the magazine that both Chinese platforms exploit de minimis clauses in Colombia’s Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, and China’s slave-like unethical labor practices swamp Colombia’s market with cheap low-quality products, displacing local products of better quality. Semana stated that Colombian customers are aware that there is a difference between “what you order at Temu and what you get,” due to the low-cost and low-quality offerings sold by both Chinese platforms. In spite of that, the magazine reported, purchases made by Colombians on the Chinese platforms continue to grow, “especially in terms of clothing and accessories,” with its customer base not just increasing among the youth, but also between those aged 40-60. “Colombia has not been immune to this phenomenon of global consumerism, which encourages people to buy unnecessary items, in many cases motivated by low prices. However, these platforms have been heavily criticized around the world for the quality of their products, the working conditions of those who produce them, and, above all, the tariff advantages that allow them to be extremely cheap for the end consumer,” Semana’s report read. In October, far-left President Gustavo Petro called for the suspension of Colombia’s ten-percent tariff on yarn and textile inputs entering the country on grounds that the measure would help reduce costs for the Colombian clothing industry. Semana stated in its report that the measure was rejected by foreign trade entrepreneurs, local cotton growers, and Colombian clothing sector unions, who said that it would not work and would put thousands of jobs at risk — arguing that the real problem for the Colombian clothing manufacturing sector is Temu and Shein. Luis Carmona, president of Sindelhato Fabricato, a 1,200-member Colombian textile workers union, told Semana that it is impossible to compete against China’s working conditions and the Chinese platforms’ “dumping practices” of selling below production costs. “That is unfair and it is pure parcel trade that the government has to correct,” Carmona said, and stressed that he believes the only solution lies in having Shein and Temu pay “all the taxes they owe on their purchases.” Semana stressed that one of Temu and Shein’s greatest advantages is that they qualify for de minimis exceptions on their low-value import shipments — a loophole that, in the case of the United States, was shut down by President Donald Trump in July. According to Semana, de minimis rules present the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Colombia and the United States are allegedly being exploited by Temu and Shein, as Colombian-bound shipments that come from America do not pay taxes, unlike those that are shipped from China, which are subject to local taxation. “International digital commerce platforms are welcome, as they help create consumption habits based on trends such as gamification, which leads more people to go digital, and it is desirable to have competition, but under conditions of parity, which is precisely what is not happening,” María Fernanda Quiñones, president of the Colombian Chamber of Electronic Commerce (CCCE), told Semana. Quiñones explained to the magazine that there is no competition parity due to an interpretation of the FTA deal with the United States. She asserted that, according to its terms, de minimis shipments “which are worth a maximum of $200 (roughly 776,000 Colombian pesos), do not pay customs duties or Value Added Tax.” “This also includes purchases on Amazon that do not exceed that value, which can be resolved with a concept from the Ministry of Commerce, without the need for a decree or a bill,” she said. Quiñones, who pointed out to Semana that the United States has already shutdown de minimis loopholes, deemed the situation as “very harmful competition” in Colombia, one that not just affects clothing manufacturers but also entrepreneurs who have invested in regional digital marketplaces such as Mercado Libre and Falabella. “It is a matter of political will, and now is the time to do it, because several countries around the world are correcting it,” Quiñones said. Other South American countries have enacted measures to increase taxation on local shipping laws exploited by Temu and Shein throughout 2025. In June, the government of Ecuador imposed a $20 tariff on packages shipped to the country through a specialized personal courier modality that exempts said packages from paying foreign trade tariffs and taxes. The tariff was imposed after local authorities registered a surge in clothing and footwear shipped under the courier modality, with local outlets reporting at the time that Temu package imports had “collapsed” local shipping distribution companies.

"On Friday on NewsNation’s “Now,” Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) said President Donald Trump’s tariffs were one of the “primary causes” of the Republicans’ recent election losses. Bacon said, “First of all, tariffs add costs. When the White House tries to deny that tariffs add costs, they are in denial. I think it is Economics 101 just read Milton Friedman that tariffs are a tax on the consumer. Now, I think what we’ve seen in the previous months the White House will add tariffs, drop tariffs, add tariffs so really hard to know what the impact is because there’s been no stability on this.” He added, “I’m going to support the president where I agree. I will honestly disagree where I disagree. I have never supported tariffs. Milton Friedman and the old school Republicans have always favored free trade. It was Ted Kennedy and George McGovern, the liberal Democrats in the ’70’s that wanted more protectionism. I just feel like owe it to the country to speak what I think is truth on this. I think we’ve learned the tariffs don’t work. Target tariffs, a couple countries that’s different. These broad tariff battles, we will lose. I think the election that happened last week was on affordability. I think tariffs, I would say was one of the main underlying causes, maybe not the only one, but one of the primary causes for the loss.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Trump tariffs’ fate rides on Supreme Court justices he picked The case will decide the fate of most of the import taxes Trump has imposed in office, including his “Liberation Day” tariffs President Donald Trump’s three United States Supreme Court appointees will play pivotal roles as the court considers the fate of his signature global tariffs Wednesday. Each of the three — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — has generally backed the president in a blizzard of emergency orders this year letting Trump implement his policies temporarily. But the tariff case will be the first time the court and its six-to-three Republican-appointed majority have directly considered Trump’s underlying assertions of sweeping presidential power. And to varying degrees, the Trump appointees have hinted that they aren’t sure bets to back him as he seeks unprecedented authority to levy tariffs in the name of addressing national emergencies. “I don’t think it’s inevitable that this is going to be a sort of partisan alignment, or the sort of standard 6-3 alignment that we’ve seen in some other cases,” said Roman Martinez, an appellate lawyer at Latham & Watkins who helped file a brief for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposing the tariffs. The case will decide the fate of most of the import taxes Trump has imposed since taking office, including his April 2 “Liberation Day” tariffs. Trump says the tariffs are authorized by the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president a panoply of tools to address national security, foreign policy and economic emergencies – but doesn’t explicitly authorize tariffs. Administration lawyers say the national trade deficit and fentanyl crisis constitute emergencies that let the president invoke the law and impose tariffs on trillions of dollars of trade. Here’s a look at how each Trump appointee might approach the case, along with another key figure, Chief Justice John Roberts. The companies and states challenging the levies will probably need the votes of two of the four to win the case. - Businesses press Supreme Court to strike down Donald Trump's emergency tariff power - Trump says Canada trade talks won't resume, contradicting Wright - Advertisement 1Story continues below The court’s three liberals Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — are likely to vote against Trump. Conservatives Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito usually side with Trump. Brett Kavanaugh Some court watchers say Kavanaugh is the most likely of the Trump appointees to back his tariffs. It’s a bit of an unusual spot for Kavanaugh, who in other contexts joins Barrett or Roberts to put restraints on their more conservative colleagues, including Gorsuch. But Kavanaugh is a staunch advocate of presidential power, particularly when interpreting statutes affecting foreign affairs or national security. “The usual understanding is that Congress intends to give the president substantial authority and flexibility to protect America and the American people,” he wrote in June in a case involving the Federal Communications Commission. Kavanaugh made those comments while discussing the so-called major questions doctrine, an issue that could be central in the tariff case. Under that doctrine, which the court used repeatedly to thwart Democrat Joe Biden during his presidency, federal agencies need explicit congressional authorization to take actions that have sweeping economic or political significance. The doctrine “has not been applied by this court in the national security or foreign policy contexts, because the canon does not reflect ordinary congressional intent in those areas,” Kavanaugh wrote. The best hope for the challengers may be that Kavanaugh will see the case as more about the tariff and taxing powers that the Constitution allocates to Congress than about the president’s foreign-affairs and national-security authority. Even so, the opponents may be hard-pressed to win over Kavanaugh. He “may be less in play for the plaintiffs who are challenging the tariffs,” said Elizabeth Prelogar, an appellate lawyer at Cooley who was Biden’s solicitor general. Neil Gorsuch In contrast, Gorsuch might be less sympathetic to Trump than the conservative justice is in other contexts. A stickler for statutory language, Gorsuch is likely to have questions about Trump’s use of a law that doesn’t explicitly mention either tariffs or taxes. The closest the law comes is by saying the president may “regulate” the “importation” of products in emergency situations. Gorsuch is a staunch advocate of both the major questions doctrine and a related legal argument known as the nondelegation doctrine, which limits Congress’ leeway to hand off its constitutional legislative and taxing powers. In the FCC case, he said the non-delegation doctrine was especially important as a check on Congress’s ability to give away its domestic taxing power, though Gorsuch said tariffs might be a different matter. Though he normally aligns with Thomas and Alito, Gorsuch may be more likely to vote against Trump’s tariffs than Kavanaugh is, according to Prelogar. “It might actually be the chief, Barrett and Gorsuch who are in play,” she said. Amy Coney Barrett Like Gorsuch, Barrett is a textualist who focuses heavily on the words of a statute. She has embraced a softer version of the major questions doctrine than some of her colleagues, describing it as a “common sense” tool to help ascertain how much power Congress was handing off. Because the Constitution vests all legislative powers with Congress, “a reasonable interpreter would expect it to make the big-time policy calls itself, rather than pawning them off to another branch,” she wrote in 2023, when she joined the court in striking down Biden’s bid to slash the student debt of 40 million people. One can imagine Barrett voting to block Trump’s tariffs as a similarly “big-time policy call” that Congress didn’t authorize. But her opinion didn’t mention taxes or tariffs, and she didn’t say whether foreign-policy or national-security implications would affect her analysis. John Roberts Roberts tends to care less about legal doctrine than the Trump appointees and more about the court’s institutional role and practical ramifications. The chief justice famously cast the deciding vote in 2012 to uphold Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, declining to invalidate that president’s signature domestic accomplishment even while disagreeing with him on major legal questions. Roberts now will have to decide whether to vote against Trump’s top economic initiative. Doing so may entail a cost, given Trump’s penchant for lashing out at the court and individual justices when they don’t agree with him. “The justices who are going to determine the outcome of this case are going to feel like they need a really pretty strong case on the legal merits before they’re going to decide that they’re going to cross swords with the president,” said Donald Verrilli, an appellate lawyer at Munger, Tolles & Olson and former solicitor general under Barack Obama. “You can’t help but think that that’s going to be hovering over the decision-making process in this case,” Verrilli added.

"Listen to this article in summarized format Reflecting on the Q2 numbers, Shenoy noted that the quarter turned out better than feared despite tariff-related concerns and limited benefits from GST cuts. “So, two aspects here, the results were kind of decent compared to what we thought it would be very muted because most of the impact of the tariffs and all that stuff would have hit us at least in this quarter and the GST cuts did not really meaningfully impact the quarter's results,” he said. According to him, Nifty earnings posted modest double-digit growth, while midcap and smallcap companies delivered more than 10–11% growth in profits. What makes this more meaningful, he explained, is the unusually low inflation backdrop: “A 14% earnings growth is different at a 9% inflation or a 7% inflation versus at a 2% inflation rate.” Shenoy added that corporate capex is showing early revival signs, while retail demand softened temporarily but is likely to improve with GST-driven price reductions. Stronger festive sentiment in October was visible across autos and some smaller financial services firms, he said. He sees attractive opportunities in autos, healthcare, engineering and capex-linked companies — themes he believes could sustain for the next few years. But the next leg of the recovery depends heavily on the October–December quarter. With inflation much lower than policy rates, Shenoy argued that the economy could benefit from monetary easing. “India is a capital deficient country and we cannot keep starving ourselves of capital by keeping interest rates this high when inflation is so low,” he said. ‘More Like a Traders’ Market Right Now’ Asked whether the market is turning into a trader’s playground, Shenoy agreed the environment is still very tactical. “You are seeing a number of results, in fact in some companies where the valuations have been high even good results have meant a stock has broken down… there is a bit of a mean reversion play of some sort,” he observed. However, he also believes sustained trends are finally reappearing after nearly a year of choppy short-term moves. Healthcare names, smaller banks and autos have shown consistent strength over the past two months. If this continues, the market could shift from being traders-dominated to becoming more broad-based, he said. Banks in Transition: Hope, Consolidation and Selective Strength On the BFSI sector, Shenoy highlighted that credit growth — still hovering around 10–12% — needs to pick up meaningfully to support broader economic expansion. “For an economy to grow eventually the overall credit growth has to be at the same levels as we expect the economy to grow at a nominal basis,” he said. Public sector banks have seen a valuation reset thanks to digitalisation, consolidation and cleaner balance sheets post-mergers. Private banks, especially smaller ones with strong digital strategies, are also gaining traction. He pointed to rising foreign interest in certain Indian banks, which is helping push valuations higher. NBFCs, however, face a more uneven landscape. While larger NBFCs remain well-positioned, smaller ones continue to struggle with widening spreads and higher borrowing costs, especially in a falling-rate environment dominated by aggressive public-sector lenders. Shenoy summarised the pecking order clearly: “The bets would still be small private sector banks, larger private sector banks later, and then large NBFCs.” (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

"With just one and a half months to go before the year ends, China still hasn’t ramped up purchases of U.S. soybeans under a trade agreement made with President Donald Trump a few weeks ago. After he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a regional economic summit in South Korea, the White House said Beijing committed to buying at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans during the final two months of 2025 and buying at least 25 million tons annually in 2026, 2027, and 2028. That’s after China hadn’t placed any orders for U.S. soybeans this harvest season amid the trade war with Trump, creating panic among farmers who had relied on the world’s second largest economy as their top export market. Meanwhile, Beijing has turned to Brazil and Argentina for soybeans, which are also cheaper as they don’t face retaliatory Chinese tariffs. Now, China has imported so much supply from South America it has a glut of soybeans. Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at StoneX, said in a note on Tuesday the latest data from China “provided no evidence to support the notion that there will be a substantial increase in state purchases to meet the 12 million metric ton commitment for calendar year 2025 as stated by the White House.” China’s soybean processors have purchased about 40 million tons from South America this season and “have zero financial incentive” to buy more U.S. soybeans, he added. Such purchases would have to come from state buyers for China’s reserve, but there’s very little indication that they are on track to buy 12 million tons by year’s end or 25 million next year, Suderman warned. In fact, China’s oversupply of South American soybeans has slashed prices more than 20% from an April peak in key coastal Chinese regions, according to Mysteel data cited by Reuters. Despite the glut, private importers are still booking soybean shipments from Brazil for next month, traders told Reuters. Non-compliance with terms of the deal reached in Korea could reignite the U.S.-China trade war, which earlier saw Trump threaten to impose an additional 100% tariff on Beijing in response to strict export controls on rare earths. “The administration expects our trading partners to adhere to their deal commitments,” a U.S. official told Fortune. “The president reserves the right to adjust tariff rates, export controls, and other concessions to hold our trading partners accountable to their deal commitments.” “Recently, China’s ministry of commerce has released relevant information on the China-US economic and trade consultations in Kuala Lumpur, introducing the main outcomes and consensus reached during the consultations. These include agricultural trade,” said Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for China’s embassy in the U.S. “China is an important participant in global agricultural trade and will continue to uphold an attitude of openness and cooperation, deepening mutually beneficial cooperation with global trading partners and jointly maintaining an open, stable and sustainable global trading system.” StoneX’s Suderman noted China appears to be complying with other parts of the trade deal, namely limiting exports of components used to produce fentanyl. Those export curbs cleared the way for Trump to lower his fentanyl-related tariff on China to 10% from 20%. Beijing has suggested removing that remaining 10% is necessary for it to reverse its own retaliatory duty on U.S. agricultural commodities, Suderman explained. “Unfortunately, time is running out for the removal of that 10% tariff to make much of a difference in the purchase of U.S. soybeans, with cheaper new crop Brazilian supplies already booked to start arriving at Chinese ports in February,” he added. “The door hasn’t closed yet for U.S. soybeans, but we’re getting very close to that point.”",right

""The other factor is, in the last few days, Wall Street has pivoted backward rather strongly to the notion that the Fed's going to cut rates in December,"" Carlson added. ""And I think that's probably the biggest impetus for the market, not just for today, but for the recent days."" A poll conducted by Reuters showed that, on average, analysts expect the S&P 500 to rise by 12% between now and year-end 2026, powered by a robust economy, continued tech sector strength and an accommodative Fed. The Fed's Beige Book, which summarizes economic conditions by district, appeared to have little to no effect on rate cut expectations. Financial markets are currently pricing in an 84.9% probability that the central bank will implement a 25-basis-point reduction to its key Fed funds target rate at the conclusion of its December policy meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Airlines were sharply higher on what is traditionally the busiest travel day of the year for commercial carriers. The S&P 1500 Airlines index jumped 3.0%. Air traffic is often viewed as a barometer of consumer health, which bodes well heading into the holiday shopping season, which kicks off on Thanksgiving and is followed by Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The period is crucial for U.S. retailers as they court shoppers and navigate tariff-squeezed profit margins and a wave of corporate layoffs. Even so, while the National Retail Federation forecasts 2025 holiday sales to surpass $1 trillion for the first time, forecasts from discount retailers such as Walmart and Target have been mixed. Economic data showed consensus-topping core capital goods orders in September. While the report from the Commerce Department is stale due to government shutdown delays, it suggests corporate expenditures are more robust than economists predicted. On the other hand, while initial claims for unemployment insurance landed below consensus, ongoing claims remain on an upward trend, supporting recent survey data showing consumers' assessment of the labor market is deteriorating. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 314.67 points, or 0.67%, to 47,427.12, the S&P 500 gained 46.73 points, or 0.69%, to 6,812.61 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 189.10 points, or 0.82%, to 23,214.69. Among the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, utilities topped percentage gainers, while communication services suffered the biggest drop. Dell Technologies jumped 5.8% in the wake of its better-than-expected earnings and upbeat forecast. Human resources software firm Workday slid 7.9% after the company reported third-quarter subscription revenue in line with estimates. Deere's weaker-than-expected annual profit forecast, weighed down by tariff effects, sent the heavy machinery maker's shares down 5.7%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.37-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 290 new highs and 29 new lows on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 3,183 stocks rose and 1,492 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.13-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 133 new highs and 48 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 14.78 billion shares, compared with the 19.49 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

"- In today’s CEO Daily: Diane Brady talks to USA Rare Earth CEO Barbara Humpton. - The big story: Trump calls for the execution of six Democrats. - The markets: Down, down, and down. - Plus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune. Good morning. Ronald Reagan once joked that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’ There may be an exception to that saying: helping U.S. companies compete in rare earths, a realm where China now dominates mining, refining, and manufacturing. That commitment certainly matters to Barbara Humpton, who last month left the top job at Siemens USA to become CEO of USA Rare Earth. Founded in Oklahoma in 2019, the company’s mission is to develop a domestic supply chain for magnets made with rare-earth elements, which are critical in everything from electric vehicles and computers to renewable energy and advanced manufacturing. “I’m delighted that I’ve arrived to find that the Trump administration is laser-focused on this,” she told me. “In the case of semiconductors, the U.S. holds some really important cards, but in rare earths, it’s rather the opposite, right?” Washington has not yet bought a stake in USA Rare Earth (market cap: $1.62 billion), but Humpton said she has been in close communication with the Administration. As MP Materials CEO James Litinsky, whose mining company is now one of several partly owned by the U.S. government, recently told my colleague Jordan Blum: “This is really a Manhattan Project-style effort with all-out intensity.” What’s surprised Humpton most during her first weeks on the job is that, as an industry, “we have not yet begun to operate as a healthy market outside of China.” Her plan: Go to the most fragile parts of the supply chain, invest, and scale to fix any bottlenecks in supply and production. As a first step, the company recently announced the acquisition of Less Common Metals, a U.K.-based company that Humpton describes as “the only scaled metal and alloy maker outside of China, so we can dramatically scale that weakest link in the supply chain.” As for Reagan’s warning: “I think government engagement matters right now,” said Humpton. “Once the flywheel gets going and we have robust capabilities outside of China, I believe the market will sustain itself, but we have to be on a sharp lookout for dumping.” Then again, as we’ve seen with renewables, what one President giveth, another can taketh away. But, as she argues, “this is probably the most bipartisan issue in our government right now, to make sure that we are not dependent on China.” Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Top news Trump calls for the execution of six Democratic members of Congress The Democratic lawmakers, concerned over Trump’s use of troops against Americans on U.S. soil, had made a video urging members of the military to refuse illegal orders. Trump responded by demanding their arrest, trial, and the death penalty. “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” he said on social media. The White House said it had not issued any illegal orders, and the Democrats did not cite any examples of such orders. Nevada congresswoman cites Fortune reporting in letter calling for accountability from Elon Musk’s Boring Company Congresswoman Dina Titus (D—NV) sent a letter on Wednesday to Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo demanding transparency and accountability over rescinded safety citations and environmental violations involving the Boring Company, Elon Musk’s tunneling operation, Fortune exclusively reported. Titus has called for a public hearing and federal investigation into the company’s Vegas Loop project and the safety concerns that Fortune has consistently reported on over the past two years. Gov. Lombardo’s press secretary did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Zelensky says he is ready to talk about U.S. peace plan The president of Ukraine said he is ready to discuss “their vision” for peace, referring to Washington’s 28-point peace plan to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. Although the plan contains some military security guarantees from NATO and the U.S., it is unlikely to be acceptable to Zelensky because it requires Ukraine to cede territory to Russia and reduce the size of its military, leaving it vulnerable to further incursion from Moscow. Rise in ‘Bad PIKs’ shows ‘cracks’ in private credit market The number of private credit deals that are changed after the initial deal is signed to include more risky terms for the lender is on the rise, according to Brian Garfield, Lincoln International’s managing director and head of U.S. portfolio valuations. 10.6% of all deals now feature a “payment-in-kind” (PIK), and of those a majority, 57.2%, are “bad PIKs,” where the original deal was changed prior to maturity. Trump’s tariff rollback takes a chunk out of projected deficit reductions New budget projections from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that Trump’s recent rollbacks of his tariffs have negated nearly $800 billion in expected reductions from U.S. deficits. In August, the agency projected that the tariff policy at that point could reduce the deficit by $3.3 trillion through 2035. DOJ announces arrest of semiconductor smugglers The Department of Justice announced on Thursday the arrest of four men alleged to have run a smuggling operation moving Nvidia chips from Alabama through Malaysia and Thailand into China. The DOJ’s indictment accuses the Chinese military of seeking these chips for “weapons design and testing, including for weapons of mass destruction as well as in connection with the PRC’s development and deployment of advanced AI surveillance tools.” Jefferies’ Chris Wood warns of ‘AI capex arms race’ Wood has a track record of spotting speculative bubbles. He called the dotcom boom, Japan’s credit bubble and the U.S. housing bubble before many of his contemporaries. So when he warned of an “AI capex arms race” at the Fortune Innovation Forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on Tuesday, the audience paid attention.

"Listen to this article in summarized format Sinha told ET Now that while real GDP is impressive, nominal GDP is a more direct indicator of corporate pricing strength and tax revenue potential. “Nominal GDP being so low is concerning because it reflects very weak inflation. Pricing power is low and this will show up in corporate revenues—especially for smaller firms,” she said. Low inflation could hit government revenues With CPI inflation at 0.25% and WPI in negative territory, India’s benign inflation environment is starting to weigh on fiscal math.“Tax collections—both direct and indirect—are already below budgeted levels. Without the RBI dividend windfall, government finances would be under stress,” Sinha added. A slower nominal GDP also mechanically pushes the fiscal deficit ratio higher. IMF’s data critique valid, upgraded GDP methodology coming Responding to the IMF’s concerns about outdated metrics and the lack of seasonally adjusted data, Sinha said the issues are real and already under review.“MoSPI is actively updating the methodology—coverage, data sources, and deflation techniques will all be upgraded. The new GDP series should be more robust,” Sinha said. US tariff impact to show up more clearly in October data With the additional US tariffs kicking in at the end of August, Sinha said the Q2 GDP print only captures one month of impact, and even that was masked by heavy front-loading of exports.“Exporters and global buyers pre-stocked before tariffs began. That boosted Q2 numbers artificially,” she noted. While exports to the US have contracted, rerouting via other markets has softened the blow, at least so far. RBI rate-cut decision: “A very difficult call” With RBI’s December 5 policy meeting around the corner, Sinha expects a tough balancing act: Growth is high Inflation is extremely low Despite the strong GDP print, Sinha believes there is still room for a 25 bps rate cut. “RBI may use this window of low inflation to deliver a shallow cut, anticipating growth moderation in the second half,” she said.

"Calling the duty an unfair surcharge, the think tank said the tariff, originally levied as a penalty for India’s earlier purchases of Russian oil, no longer reflects current trade realities. The appeal comes just days after US President Donald Trump publicly acknowledged that India has “very substantially” stopped buying Russian oil. On November 11, Trump also confirmed that the duty had been imposed solely because of India’s earlier Russian crude imports, asserting that “we're going to be bringing the tariffs down.” GTRI said that with this admission and assurance, the US should move “without delay” to withdraw the levy, instead of tying its removal to wider, slower-moving trade talks. Also Read: US sanctions spoil Russia’s well-oiled trade with India; New Delhi’s loadings plunge 66% in Nov According to GTRI, keeping the tariff in place now effectively punishes Indian exporters despite India’s major pivot toward American energy suppliers. Such prolongation, it warned, risks undermining goodwill and slowing the momentum in ongoing trade negotiations. A timely rollback, GTRI argued, would reinforce Trump’s commitment, reward India’s rapid reorientation toward US crude and LPG, and remove an irritant in bilateral ties. It added that ending the surcharge would restore parity with other major economies, especially China, that continue importing far larger volumes of Russian oil without facing similar penalties. Latest trade data underscores India’s shift. Between April and September 2025, India’s imports of US petroleum crude soared 66.9 per cent to USD 5.7 billion, driving up total US petroleum and product exports to India by 36.3 per cent to USD 7.5 billion. Conversely, India’s exports of petroleum products to the US dipped 15 per cent to USD 2.3 billion, easing concerns in Washington that Indian refiners were routing Russian crude into US markets. India has also signalled deeper long-term energy cooperation. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) has contracted 10 million barrels of US Midland crude for delivery between November and March. Separately, New Delhi has sealed its first structured deal to import about 2.2 million tonnes of US liquefied petroleum gas in 2026, equivalent to nearly 10 per cent of India’s annual LPG needs. GTRI noted that India is now among the few major economies significantly scaling up imports of US oil and LPG. With no remaining strategic, political, or economic rationale for the tariff, the think tank said the United States should lift the surcharge immediately to signal that its policies remain “principled, fair, and responsive” to partners who act on American concerns.

"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, ""We cannot interfere in the diplomatic relations between the US and India. We understand that there is pressure on India."" He added that this pressure now influences how Russia approaches its partnership with New Delhi. Peskov was addressing an online briefing for Indian journalists organised by the Sputnik news agency. Elaborating on Moscow's position, he said, ""This is why we have to be careful in creating an architecture of the relationship that is free from the influence of any third country."" Highlighting India's independent foreign policy choices, Peskov said, ""We know that India is very sovereign in defining its national interests. We admire this characteristic of India,"" underscoring Moscow's view that New Delhi acts with strategic autonomy in global affairs. India and Russia are already conducting trade in their national currencies and are in talks to link banking channels - an issue set to feature prominently at the December 5 Summit. ""We are aware that we're selling much more than we buy from India. And we know that our Indian friends are concerned about that,"" he said. To address this, he announced that an importers' forum will be held during Putin's visit, aimed at identifying specific Indian goods and services Russia can purchase. Senior MEA officials said that economic partnership, trade and investment ties and mobility pact will be the focus of Putin's visit as India seeks to increase quantum of Indian exports to Russia. Several pacts concerning trade and investments will be signed during the visit while key defence projects will be discussed, MEA officials hinted.",right
"Sour Puss moves some liqueur production to Canada after trade war devastates sales MONTREAL — The head of the Sour Puss liqueur brand says he had no choice but to move part of the production line north of the border to Montreal amid the Canada-U.S. trade war. Andy England, chief executive of Phillips Distilling Co., says it lost virtually all of its business in Canada after U.S. President Donald Trump set off a tariff tit-for-tat that prompted provincial alcohol distributors to clear their shelves of American booze. “In March, when the trade war began, we were suddenly removed from store shelves in most Canadian provinces,” England said in an interview. “We literally lost our business in Canada.” Nearly 98 per cent of the one million Sour Puss bottles sold by the company last year were in Canada, amounting to Canadian sales of $23 million, the CEO said. The Minnesota-based distiller kicked off production of Sour Puss in Montreal for the Canadian market on Wednesday. It says the raspberry-flavoured liqueur will be made at the city’s Station 22 distillery under a multi-year agreement, with bottles slated to hit store shelves next month. Two provinces have already placed orders, England said. The move represents a rare win for Canadian manufacturing amid a tariff spat that has seen automakers and others announce plans to move some production south of the border. It also means a pullout by Phillips would not happen any time soon, given the prolonged deal with Station 22 as well as ongoing trade volatility. “I have no idea if there will be a trade agreement, if it will include tariffs, and if it will only last six months,” said England. “One of the most important things for us is stability.” Before trade relations soured, about 13 per cent of the production output across brands at the Phillips Distilling plant in St. Paul, Minn., flowed to the Canadian market, he said. The move to Montreal lowers transportation costs and makes it easier to adapt to Canadian consumer preferences. England gave the example of ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages — canned cocktails or hard seltzers, for example — a segment that is gaining popularity in Quebec. The company plans to roll out a ready-to-drink product under the Sour Puss brand early next year. “We probably wouldn’t have been able to launch such a product without Station 22, because we don’t have a can line at our Minnesota plant,” England said.

"President Donald Trump sees tariffs — or the threat of them — as a powerful tool to bend nations to his will. He has used them in an unprecedented way, not only as the underpinning of his economic agenda, but also as the cornerstone of his foreign policy in his second term. He has wielded the import taxes as a threat to secure ceasefiresfrom countries at war. He has used them to browbeat nations into promising to do more to stop people and drugs from flowing across their borders. He has used them, in Brazil’s case, as political pressure because its judicial system prosecuted a former leader who was a Trump ally, and in a recent blowup with Canada, as punishment for a television ad. This week, the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the Republican president has overstepped federal law with many of his tariffs. A ruling against him could limit or even take away that swift and blunt leverage that much of his foreign policy has relied on. Trump increasingly has expressed agitation and anxiety about the looming decision in a case he says is one of the most important in U.S. history. He has said it would be a “disaster” for the United States if the justices fail to overturn lower court rulings that found he went too far in using an emergency powers law to put his tariffs in place. Trump had said he wanted to take the highly unusual step of attending the arguments in person, but on Sunday said he had ruled it out, saying he didn’t want to be a distraction. “I wanted to go so badly — I just don’t want to do anything to deflect the importance of that decision,” he told reporters on Air Force One. The Justice Department, in its defense of the tariffs, has highlighted the expansive way Trump has used them, arguing that the trade penalties are part of his power over foreign affairs, an area where the courts should not second-guess the president. Earlier this year, two lower courts and most judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that Trump did not have power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to set tariffs — a power the Constitution grants to Congress. Some dissenting judges on the court, though, said the 1977 law allows the president to regulate imports during emergencies without specific limitations. The courts left the tariffs in place while the Supreme Court considers the issue. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to wield them as he has tried to pressure or punish other countries on matters related — and unrelated — to trade. “The fact of the matter is that President Trump has acted lawfully by using the tariff powers granted to him by Congress in IEEPA to deal with national emergencies and to safeguard our national security and economy,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “We look forward to ultimate victory on this matter with the Supreme Court.” Still, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the Trump trade team is working on contingency plans should the high court rule against the Republican administration. “We do have backup plans,” Leavitt said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “But ultimately…we are hopeful that the Supreme Court will rule on the right side of the law and do what’s right for our country. The importance of this case cannot be overstated. The president must have the emergency authority to utilize tariffs.” Most presidents haven’t used tariffs as a foreign policy tool Modern presidents have used financial sanctions such as freezing assets or blocking trade, not tariffs, for their foreign policy and national security aims, said Josh Lipsky, a former Obama White House and State Department staffer who is now the international economics chair at the Atlantic Council. There are other laws that presidents can use to impose tariffs. But they require a monthslong process to justify the rates. Trump, citing the IEEPA, moves faster and more dramatically. He signs executive orders imposing new rates and fires off social media posts threatening additional import taxes, as he did in late October when he was angered by an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario. “Presidents have typically treated tariffs as a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,” Lipsky said. In contrast, Trump has used tariffs as the backbone of his national security and foreign policy agenda, Lipsky said. “All of it is interconnected and tariffs are at the heart of it,” he said. For example, earlier this year Trump had threatened a 30% tariff on European imports, a major increase from 1.2% before he took office. Seeking to secure Trump’s support for the NATO military alliance and for security guarantees for Ukraine in its war with Russia, the European Union struck a deal to settle for 15% tariffs. The EU Commission faced criticism from businesses and member states for giving away too much. But Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič argued the settlement was “not only about the trade. It’s about security. It’s about Ukraine.” Trump has been able “to use it in specific circumstances to get better deals — not just trade deals — but better deals overall than he might otherwise,” Lipsky said. “On the other hand, you would say there’s probably some backlash.” Supreme Court decision could rattle geopolitics — and wallets Trump’s tariff strong-arming has rattled relationships with America’s friends and foes. Some have responded by becoming more protectionist or looking to foster relations with China, which has tried to be seen as a promoter of free trade. There also is the impact on pocketbook. Some businesses have passed on some of the costs to consumers by raising prices, while others have waited to see where tariff rates end up. Tariffs traditionally have been used just as a tool to address trade practices. “There’s literally no precedent for the manner that President Trump is using them,” said Emily Kilcrease, who was a deputy assistant U.S. trade representative and earlier worked on trade issues at the National Security Council as a career civil servant during the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations, “The use of tariffs the way that President Trump is using them is like — just broadscale attack on an economy as a way to incentivize a foreign government to change their posture,” said Kilcrease, now a director at the Center for a New American Security think tank. But she said the case is not clear-cut. Kilcrease said she thinks there is a “decent chance” the Supreme Court could side with Trump because IEEPA gives the president “broad, flexible emergency powers.” The case is also coming before a Supreme Court that has thus far been reluctant to check to Trump’s wide-ranging use of executive powers. If the court constrains Trump, it could leave foreign governments questioning whether to try to renegotiate trade agreements recently struck with the Trump administration, experts said. But there are political realities at play too, because reneging on deals could affect other foreign policy or economic priorities. The administration could pivot to try to use other laws to justify the tariffs, though that could mean a more complex and bureaucratic process, Kilcrease said. “It certainly doesn’t take tariffs off the table,” she said. “It just makes them a little bit slower.” ___ Associated Press writer Lindsay Whitehurst contributed to this report.",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format What’s fuelling this stealth accumulation is a convergence of tariff-hike visibility, accelerating ARPU trajectories, and the impending Jio IPO in the first half of 2026. With both Airtel and Jio demonstrating superior revenue resilience, market-share consolidation, and industry-leading EBITDA expansion, the Street is recalibrating its growth lens towards a multi-year monetisation cycle rather than a one-off valuation rebound. Brokerages like Jefferies, JPMorgan and others have upgraded their outlook on the sector, projecting 14–25% earnings CAGR. Reliance Jio is widely expected to increase tariffs ahead of its proposed listing, with investors banking on further hikes post-IPO to juice valuations and demonstrate pricing power to public markets. Jefferies has raised its target enterprise value for Jio to $180 billion, applying a 15x EV/EBITDA multiple, a 10 percent premium to Bharti Airtel based on superior growth outlook. The brokerage projects that ""Reliance Jio remains well-placed to deliver 18%/21% CAGR in revenues/EBITDA over FY26-28, given rising tariffs in mobile and sharp growth in home broadband business led by FWA. Growth is likely to remain strong, led by scale-up of the enterprise business and monetisation of tech stack."" Also Read | Jio IPO: Hidden value unlocking for Reliance or holding company discount for investors? The global brokerage has identified telecom as one of the fastest-growing sectors, with earnings growth at 25 percent, second only to cement at 34 percent. The firm expects ""sector revenues to rise at 14% CAGR to US$45bn over FY26-28E, with market share broadly stable,"" and maintains Bharti Airtel as its top pick. JPMorgan's overweight thesis is anchored on sustained tariff repair: ""17% tariff hikes across the portfolio, as Bharti saw success in intervention in CY23, with limited churn and a narrowing of the gap between postpaid and prepaid to 1.6x in CY24 from 3x in CY21."" The bank expects ""a 15% tariff hike in Nov-25 and Nov-26, as we expect the market to stay in tariff repair into CY26/27 - the tariff repair cycle was a two-year cycle in the past that was disrupted by 5G rollouts and elections, and now we expect the two-year cadence to return."" JPMorgan also projects ""a meaningful increase in dividends over FY26/27 from improving FCF and de-leverage,"" making Bharti increasingly attractive to income-focused institutional investors. During the September 2025 quarter, sector revenue growth moderated to 10 percent year-on-year on a high base, with Bharti and Jio gaining 70 and 30 basis points market share versus FY25, respectively. Bharti's revenue growth was higher at 12 percent year-on-year, reflecting its focus on quality subscriber additions. Jefferies noted that ""steady revenue growth for VIL augurs well for Indus Towers."" Axis Capital highlighted that Q2FY26 was a steady quarter for telcos, with Bharti India's mobile growth of 2 percent quarter-on-quarter primarily supported by ARPU uptick, while Jio benefited from a mix of ARPU and subscriber growth at 3 percent. Fixed wireless access (FWA) momentum in subscriber additions was strong, led by Jio benefiting from its head start in the segment and early standalone 5G adoption, capturing 75 percent market share. ""With 5G expansion complete, EBITDA flow-through is healthy and capex intensity is declining, which would reflect in healthy FCF. Bharti Airtel/Hexacom should see increased payout as a result,"" Axis Capital noted. The brokerage rates Bharti Airtel/Hexacom as BUY on healthy growth and improving payout, notwithstanding high valuation. However, JPMorgan flagged potential risks to Bharti's free cash flow story. The bank warned that ambitions to accelerate broadband growth, build a 1GW data center, and early signs of 5G capacity constraints ""suggest sharp risks to this assumption."" JPMorgan highlighted a scenario where capex rises sharply in FY27: ""Our scenario for matching Jio for Homes adds, quadrupling Nxtra in four years and arresting the drop in 5G network quality suggests the start of a new capex cycle and could mean up to 56% upside risk to Airtel's FY27 capex estimates and 32% drop in its FCF."" The bank noted that Bharti's incremental broadband subscriber share has dropped to 25 percent in 2Q26 despite a 4.5x increase in homes capex over four years, and that Bharti's 5G speeds have fallen behind Jio's for the first time in a year, along with a concomitant drop in network availability. Key investor queries flagged by Axis Capital include the timing of the next tariff hike, Bharti's capital allocation strategy, and Jio's listing timeline—all critical triggers that could accelerate or derail the FII thesis. The Rs 43,000 crore question: Is 2026 shaping up to be the year Airtel and Jio dominate the market narrative, delivering on the tariff repair story and translating ARPU gains into shareholder returns?

"Canada's corporations churning out profits despite tariff hit The data show Canada’s companies holding up well overall despite the ongoing pressures of United States trade policy Canada’s corporations continue to expand their profits, even as the economy contends with tariff damage. Operating profits rose 3.8 per cent to $200 billion in the third quarter, according to data released Monday by Statistics Canada. That’s the fastest pace of growth in two years and follows a seasonally adjusted contraction of 2.4 per cent in the second quarter. In the financial sector, earnings before interest and taxes rose six per cent to $96 billion, driven higher by lower provisions for credit losses and increased non-interest income in banking, the agency said. Non-financial industries also expanded their operating profits 1.9 per cent between July and September, and increases were recorded in 25 of 39 subcategories. Profits rose in 10 of 14 of the country’s manufacturing industries. The data show Canada’s companies holding up well overall despite the ongoing pressures of United States trade policy and an elevated unemployment rate. Major tariffs remain in place on steel, aluminum, autos and lumber products, and the central bank expects meagre economic growth in the second half of 2025 as business investment and exports languish. At the same time, many of Canada’s goods exports to the U.S. are exempt from duties provided they’re covered by the free trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, leaving the country with a relatively low effective tariff rate. “Tariffs are having a brutal but narrow hit,” said Fred Demers, head strategist of multi-asset solutions with BMO Global Asset Management. “Firms are defending strong profit margins and investors should remain comfortable,” he said. —With assistance from Mario Baker Ramirez.

"Listen to this article in summarized format Market Expert Nischal Maheshwari in an interview with ET Now says the current environment is largely stable, backed by stronger-than-expected results in the previous quarter and encouraging indicators from the first two months of the ongoing one. According to him, “we have to look at what are the conditions which are driving the market. So, domestically it is more or less a benign kind of a scenario. We have got better than expected results of the last quarter and this quarter is expected to be very good as far as consumption is concerned and the initial first two months has been pretty good from the discussions I have had with companies especially on the consumption side.” He adds that markets are now building in three expectations: better quarterly results led by consumption, a potential US tariff agreement before the year ends, and the possibility of interest rate cuts in both India and the US. “So, a lot of positive expectations. So, that is what the market is looking and poised for maybe a new high,” he notes. While benchmarks hover near record highs, the broader market has been under strain. Many midcap and smallcap stocks have sharply retreated from their 52-week highs, in some cases by as much as 50%. Maheshwari believes this correction is a natural and necessary reset. “So, market is just correcting to its norm. So, all these companies especially the midcap and the smallcaps where there was intense speculation and the valuations were totally out of whack, I think that is getting corrected and that is rightly so also,” he explains. He expects the valuation gap between large-caps and smaller stocks to normalise further. For the medium term, he sees more resilience in the larger segments. “Going ahead I see, especially the midcap and the largecap doing much better than the smallcap because as the liquidity scenario eases… the smallcaps will also start doing well. But in the medium term I see the largecap and the midcaps doing better than the smallcaps.” Among sectoral movers, aviation caught attention after InterGlobe Aviation was added to the Sensex 30 index. However, Maheshwari plays down the immediate impact of the inclusion, pointing out that most institutional flows today track the Nifty 50, where the stock is already a constituent. “I do not see any change as far as the inclusion is going to happen on Sensex because I do not know how many funds now follow Sensex,” he says. On the aviation sector more broadly, he remains cautious despite the strong run-up in shares. “As far as aviation is concerned, it has already done its part… valuations are at peak. It is the best is hold basically if somebody already owns it,” he adds. As December approaches, investors will be watching both domestic data and global policy cues closely. With earnings strength, tariff negotiations, and rate-cut expectations lining up, the market appears positioned for yet another attempt at new highs—though not without selective pockets of caution.

"CNH Industrial N.V. Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results Third quarter consolidated revenues were $4.4 billion on decreased industry demand and continued channel destocking Third quarter diluted EPS at $0.06 Amid persistent market challenges, results reflect rigorous cost management and a long-term commitment to operational excellence Net sales guidance increased; profit guidance lowered to reflect incremental tariff headwinds and unfavorable geographic sales mix Basildon, UK – November 7, 2025 – CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE: CNH) today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2025, with net income of $67 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.06 compared with net income of $310 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.24 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Consolidated revenues were $4.40 billion (down 5% compared to Q3 2024), and net sales of Industrial Activities were $3.70 billion (down 7% compared to Q3 2024). Net cash provided by operating activities was $659 million, and Industrial free cash flow absorption was $188 million in Q3 2025. “While the current trade environment remains challenging for our farmers and builders, CNH continues to take decisive actions to navigate near-term headwinds. We are maintaining disciplined production levels, reducing channel inventories, investing in technology, and driving operational excellence. Our commitment to quality and innovation is unwavering, as demonstrated by recent product launches and industry recognition. Looking ahead, we remain focused on achieving our long-term strategic targets. I am confident that the steps we are taking will position CNH for renewed growth and success as market conditions improve.” | Gerrit Marx, Chief Executive Officer | 2025 Third Quarter Results (all amounts $ million, comparison vs Q3 2024 – unless otherwise stated) | US-GAAP | |||||||| | Q3 2025 | Q3 2024 | Change | Change at c.c.(1) | ||||| | Consolidated revenues | 4,399 | 4,654 | (5)% | (7)% | |||| | of which Net sales of Industrial Activities | 3,702 | 3,997 | (7)% | (9)% | |||| | Net income | 67 | 310 | (78)% | ||||| | Diluted EPS $ | 0.06 | 0.24 | (0.18) | ||||| | Cash flow provided (used) by operating activities | 659 | 791 | (132) | ||||| | Cash and cash equivalents(2) | 2,303 | 3,191 | (888) | ||||| | Gross profit margin of Industrial Activities | 19.1% | 21.7% | (260) bps | | NON-GAAP(3) | ||||||| | Q3 2025 | Q3 2024 | Change | ||||| | Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities | 104 | 336 | (69)% | |||| | Adjusted EBIT margin of Industrial Activities | 2.8% | 8.4% | (560) bps | |||| | Adjusted net income | 109 | 304 | (64)% | |||| | Adjusted diluted EPS $ | 0.08 | 0.24 | (0.16) | |||| | Free cash flow of Industrial Activities | (188) | (180) | (8) | |||| | Adjusted gross profit margin of Industrial Activities | 19.4% | 21.7% | (230) bps | |||| The decline in net sales of Industrial Activities was mainly due to lower shipments on decreased industry demand and channel destocking. Adjusted net income was $109 million with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.08. In comparison, in Q3 2024, adjusted net income was $304 million with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.24. Income tax expense was $1 million ($75 million in Q3 2024), and the effective tax rate (“ETR”) was 2.0% (20.8% in Q3 2024) with an adjusted ETR(3) of 14.0% for the third quarter (20.7% in Q3 2024). Cash flow provided by operating activities in the quarter was $659 million ($791 million provided in Q3 2024). Free cash flow absorption of Industrial Activities was $188 million, consistent with normal working capital seasonality. | Agriculture | |||||||| | Q3 2025 | Q3 2024 | Change | Change at c.c.(1) | ||||| | Net sales | 2,963 | 3,310 | (10)% | (12)% | |||| | Adjusted EBIT | 137 | 336 | (59)% | ||||| | Adjusted EBIT margin | 4.6% | 10.2% | (560) bps | ||||| In North America, third quarter industry volume was flat year-over-year for tractors under 140 HP and fell 41% for tractors over 140 HP; combines were down 23%. In Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), tractor demand decreased 2%, while combine demand increased 19%. South America saw tractor demand down 4% and combines down 15%. In Asia Pacific, tractor demand rose 19%, while combine demand decreased 20%. Agriculture net sales decreased in the quarter by 10% to $2.96 billion versus the same period in 2024, as a result of lower shipment volumes on decreased industry demand in North America and channel inventory destocking, partially offset by favorable net price realization and improved demand in the Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa markets within EMEA. Adjusted EBIT decreased to $137 million ($336 million in Q3 2024) primarily due to lower shipment volumes, tariff costs, unfavorable geographic mix and higher SG&A expenses. These impacts were partially offset by favorable net price realization and reduced production and warranty costs. Adjusted EBIT margin was 4.6% (10.2% in Q3 2024). R&D expenses represented 8.6% of sales in Q3 2025 (6.0% in Q3 2024) including a $49 million non-cash impairment primarily related to in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) assets from the 2023 Bennamann acquisition. These assets relate to technologies that capture methane emissions from livestock waste and convert them into better-than-zero-carbon biofuel. This impairment reflects a narrowing of strategic focus to the cleaning and upgrading of the methane waste. | Construction | |||||||| | Q3 2025 | Q3 2024 | Change | Change at c.c.(1) | ||||| | Net sales | 739 | 687 | +8% | +6% | |||| | Adjusted EBIT | 14 | 40 | (65)% | ||||| | Adjusted EBIT margin | 1.9% | 5.8% | (390) bps | ||||| Global industry volume for construction equipment increased 6% year-over-year in the third quarter for Heavy equipment and 3% for Light equipment. Aggregated demand increased 4% in North America, 3% in EMEA, 1% in South America and 6% in Asia Pacific. Construction net sales increased in the quarter by 8% to $739 million, reflecting higher shipment volumes in North America and EMEA, along with favorable net price realization. Adjusted EBIT decreased to $14 million ($40 million in Q3 2024) as a result of tariff costs, unfavorable geographic mix, and higher SG&A expenses, partially offset by favorable net price realization. Adjusted EBIT margin was 1.9% (5.8% in Q3 2024). | Financial Services | |||||||| | Q3 2025 | Q3 2024 | Change | Change at c.c.(1) | ||||| | Revenues | 684 | 659 | +4% | +3% | |||| | Net income | 47 | 78 | (40)% | ||||| | Equity at quarter-end | 2,896 | 2,932 | (36) | ||||| | Retail loan originations | 2,657 | 2,841 | (184) | ||||| Revenues of Financial Services increased by 4% as a result of higher yields primarily in Brazil and favorable currency translation, partially offset by lower volumes in EMEA and North America. Net income was $47 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $31 million versus the same period in 2024, primarily driven by increased risk costs, higher SG&A expenses and lower volumes. These impacts were partially offset by improved interest margins across all regions and favorable currency translation. The managed portfolio (including unconsolidated joint ventures) was $28.5 billion as of September 30, 2025 (of which retail was 71% and wholesale was 29%), down $0.5 billion compared to September 30, 2024 (down $0.6 billion on a constant currency basis). At September 30, 2025, the receivable balance greater than 30 days past due as a percentage of receivables was 3.5% (2.2% as of September 30, 2024), mainly due to higher delinquencies in Brazil in Q3 2025. 2025 Outlook With lower industry demand and the effort to reduce excess channel inventory, the Company has produced fewer units in 2025 when compared to 2024. The lower production and sales levels have negatively impacted our segment margin results. In addition, an unfavorable sales mix shift from North America to EMEA is affecting Agriculture margins. However, the Company’s ongoing efforts to reduce its operating costs have partially mitigated the margin erosion. CNH is continuing its focus on product cost reductions through lean manufacturing principles and strategic sourcing. The Company is also carefully managing its SG&A and R&D expenses. In addition to the lower cyclical industry sales, the Company is navigating frequent changes in the global trade environment. The August 2025 expansion of steel and aluminum tariffs in the U.S., for example, has created additional exposure for CNH. Mitigation actions, such as working with the supply chain to identify alternative sources, consuming existing inventories, and pricing actions on North American products, have helped partially offset tariff headwinds. Over time, the Company expects to fully offset the tariff impacts with additional mitigation actions. However, in the near term, the Company continues to share the net tariff costs with its customers, which has further negatively impacted CNH’s 2025 margins. The Company is therefore updating its 2025 outlook as follows: - Agriculture segment net sales down between 11% and 13% year-over-year, with no currency translation effects - Agriculture segment adjusted EBIT margin between 5.7% and 6.2% - Construction segment net sales down between 3% and 5% year-over-year, with no currency translation effects - Construction segment adjusted EBIT margin between 1.7% and 2.2% - Free cash flow of Industrial Activities(5) between $200 million and $500 million - Adjusted diluted EPS(5) between $0.44 to $0.50 Conference Call and Webcast Today, at 11:30 a.m. EST, management will hold a conference call to present third quarter 2025 results to financial analysts and investors. The call can be followed live online or as a recording later at bit.ly/CNH_Q3_2025.

The tables and discussion related to the financial results of the Company and its segments shown in this press release are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. - c.c. means at constant currency. - Comparison vs. December 31, 2024. - This item is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of this press release for information regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the specific table in the “Other Supplemental Financial Information” section of this press release for the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measure and the most comparable GAAP financial measure. - Certain financial information in this report has been presented by geographic area. Our geographical regions are: (a) North America; (b) EMEA; (c) South America and (d) Asia Pacific. The geographic designations have the following meanings: - North America: United States, Canada, and Mexico; - EMEA: member countries of the European Union, European Free Trade Association, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Balkans, Russia, Türkiye, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, the African continent, and the Middle East; - South America: Central and South America, and the Caribbean Islands; and - Asia Pacific: Continental Asia (including the India subcontinent), Indonesia and Oceania. - The Company is unable to provide this reconciliation without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence, the financial impact, and the periods in which the adjustments may be recognized. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results. Non-GAAP Financial Information CNH monitors its operations through the use of several non-GAAP financial measures. CNH’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and relevant information regarding its operating results and enhance the readers’ ability to assess CNH’s financial performance and financial position. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to identify operational trends, as well as make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations and other operational decisions as they provide additional transparency with respect to our core operations. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning under U.S. GAAP and are unlikely to be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not intended to be substitutes for measures of financial performance and financial position as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. CNH’s non-GAAP financial measures are defined as follows: - Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities under U.S. GAAP is defined as net income (loss) before the following items: Income taxes, Financial Services’ results, Industrial Activities’ interest expenses, net, foreign exchange gains/losses, finance and non-service component of pension and other post-employment benefit costs, restructuring expenses, and certain non-recurring items. In particular, non-recurring items are specifically disclosed items that management considers rare or discrete events that are infrequent in nature and not reflective of on-going operational activities. - Adjusted EBIT Margin of Industrial Activities: is computed by dividing Adjusted EBIT of Industrial Activities by Net Sales of Industrial Activities. - Adjusted Net Income (Loss): is defined as net income (loss), less restructuring charges and non-recurring items, after tax. - Adjusted Diluted EPS: is computed by dividing Adjusted Net Income (loss) attributable to CNH Industrial N.V. by a weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period that takes into consideration potential common shares outstanding deriving from the CNH share-based payment awards, when inclusion is not anti-dilutive. When we provide guidance for adjusted diluted EPS, we do not provide guidance on an earnings per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end. - Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit: is defined as income taxes less the tax effect of restructuring expenses and non-recurring items, and non-recurring tax charges or benefits. - Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (“Adjusted ETR”): is computed by dividing a) adjusted income taxes by b) income (loss) before income taxes and equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, less restructuring expenses and non-recurring items. - Adjusted Gross Profit Margin of Industrial Activities: is computed by dividing Net Sales less Costs of good sold, as adjusted by non-recurring items, by Net Sales. - Net Cash (Debt) and Net Cash (Debt) of Industrial Activities: Net Cash (Debt) is defined as total debt less intersegment notes receivable, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other current financial assets (primarily current securities, short-term deposits and investments towards high-credit rating counterparties) and derivative hedging debt. CNH provides the reconciliation of Net Cash (Debt) to Total (Debt), which is the most directly comparable measure included in the consolidated balance sheets. Due to different sources of cash flows used for the repayment of the debt between Industrial Activities and Financial Services (by cash from operations for Industrial Activities and by collection of financing receivables for Financial Services), management separately evaluates the cash flow performance of Industrial Activities using Net Cash (Debt) of Industrial Activities. - Free Cash Flow of Industrial Activities (“Industrial Free Cash Flow”): refers to Industrial Activities only, and is computed as consolidated cash flow from operating activities less: cash flow from operating activities of Financial Services; investments of Industrial Activities in assets sold under operating leases, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; change in derivatives hedging debt of Industrial Activities; as well as other changes and intersegment eliminations. - Change excl. FX or Constant Currency: CNH discusses the fluctuations in revenues on a constant currency basis by applying the prior year average exchange rates to current year’s revenues expressed in local currency in order to eliminate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The tables attached to this press release provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

"In a packed room at library in a downtown Boston, Rep. Ayanna Pressley posed a blunt question: Why are Black women, who have some of the highest labor force participation rates in the country, now seeing their unemployment rise faster than most other groups? The replies Monday from policymakers, academics, business owners and community organizers laid out how economic headwinds facing Black women may indicate a troubling shift for the economy at large. The unemployment rate for Black women increased from 6.7% to 7.5% between August and September this year, the most recent month for available data because of the federal government shutdown. That compares with a 3.2% to 3.4% increase for white women over the same period. And it extended a year-long trend of the Black women’s unemployment rate increasing at a time of broad economic uncertainty. Many roundtable attendees view those numbers as both an affront and a warning about the uneven pressures on Black women. “Everyone is missing out when we’re pushed out of the workforce,” said Pressley, a progressive Democrat. “That is something that I worry about now, that you have all these women with specific expertise and specializations that we’re being deprived of.” And when Black women do have work, she said they tend to be “woefully underemployed.” Black women had the highest labor force participation rate of any female demographic in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, yet their unemployment rate remains higher than other demographics of women. Historically, their unemployment rate has trended slightly above the national average, widening during periods of slowed economic growth or recession. Black Americans are overrepresented in industries like retail, health and social services, and government administration, according to a 2024 Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey. “Black women are at the center of the Venn diagram that is our society,” said Anna Gifty Opoku-Agyeman, a PhD candidate in public policy and economics at the Harvard Kennedy School. She pointed to April as the month when Black women’s unemployment began to diverge more sharply from other groups. A policy agenda that ignores the causes, she said, could harm the broader economy. Roundtable participants cited many long-standing structural inequities but attributed most of the latest divergence to recent federal actions. They blamed the Trump administration’s downsizing of the Minority Business Development Agency and the cancellation of some federal contracts with non-profits and small businesses, saying those actions disproportionately impacted Black women. Others said tariff policies and mass federal layoffs also contributed to the strain. The administration’s opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives was repeatedly mentioned by participants as a cause for a more hostile environment for Black women to find employment, customers or government contracting. There is no concrete data on how many Black federal workers were laid off, fired or otherwise dismissed as part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping cuts through the federal government. The attendees discussed a wide range of potential solutions to the unemployment rate for Black women, including using state budgets to bolster business development for Black women, expanding microloans to different communities, increasing government resources for contracting, requiring greater transparency on corporate hiring practices and encouraging state and federal officials to enforce anti-discrimination policies. “I feel like I was just at church,” said Ruthzee Louijeune, the Boston City Council president, as the meeting wrapped up. She encouraged attendees to keep up their efforts, and she defended DEI policies as essential to a healthy workforce and political system. Without broad-based efforts, the Democrat said, the country’s business and political leadership would be “abnormal” and weakened. “Any space that does not look like our country and like our cities is not normal,” she said, “and not the city or country we are trying to build.”",right
"Tesla cofounder JB Straubel served as the brains behind the battery development for the electric vehicle giant, and he saw firsthand the massive amounts of critical minerals that are potentially wasted when it comes time to retire each EV—raw materials ripe for recycling and redeploying. China dominates most of the world’s critical mineral supply chains. Each EV battery represents a treasure trove of lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, and more that can be reused for brand-new batteries for energy storage and all sorts of devices from AI data centers to military equipment to smartphones and computers. There are 60 natural elements deemed “critical minerals” by the U.S. government, and America only produces a small minority of them. Straubel founded Redwood Materials in 2017, which is rapidly expanding and has grown into the United States’ first line of defense for recycling critical minerals in the potential supply-chain cold war with China—now at a temporary truce. “Being able to tap into materials that are already in the market can dramatically reduce the pressure on what’s needed to mine,” Straubel told Fortune. “Once you have some diversity of supply, you reduce the risk of the [Chinese] monopoly and the geopolitical concentration.” Since the U.S. launched a tariff war earlier this year and China threatened to withhold certain critical minerals, the U.S. has aggressively emphasized investments and partnerships for developing its own critical minerals mining, refining, recycling, and magnet and battery manufacturing. China currently accounts for over 80% of the global production of battery materials. Developing domestic The U.S. can’t just open a dozen new mines overnight. Recycling will increasingly play a key role, and Redwood Materials already controls roughly 90% of lithium-ion battery recycling in North America—the equivalent of 250,000 EV batteries per year. Still, that 90% equals only about 10% of the EV battery deployment in the U.S. each year. That means Redwood could expand its capacity by 10 times even if the EV market share stays flat in the U.S. Straubel refers to Redwood’s facilities as “urban mines.” Redwood leads its battery recycling from its Nevada campus and now has a brand-new, $3.5 billion, 600-acre plant in South Carolina. Nvidia recently came on as a strategic investor. “The end goal is creating a circular economy where recycling—not mining—becomes the primary source of the minerals,” Straubel said. “You’re decoupled from the geologic mine from where these things are naturally found in the earth.” Already, Redwood is the nation’s unofficial leading “miner” of cobalt through its recycling efforts, and near the top in lithium and nickel. “It’s kind of obvious, but not very intuitive, that almost all of the raw materials inside of batteries are reusable,” Straubel said. “They don’t get consumed in the application. We build the device, spend a lot of effort doing it, but then it basically just stays there its whole life. “As EVs and other energy storage products proliferate in the market, we have this incredible opportunity to evolve toward this materials economy for those products that will be 98% or 99% remanufactured over time.” As well as mining batteries for parts, Redwood already is developing its own battery energy storage systems, called BESS, from recycled materials, especially as batteries are increasingly partnered with solar and wind power for increased reliability. Redwood already deployed a battery storage microgrid for OpenAI’s Stargate data center campus in Texas. Redwood’s main source of batteries is EVs, but the company can recycle lithium-ion batteries in all shapes and sizes. Getting access to them is the challenge. “For EVs, it’s relatively easier because of the size and scale. You can’t just put it in your garbage can. That’s more of a business-to-business pathway. It’s much harder with the consumer products and devices. That tends to unfortunately have a high percentage that end up in dumps and landfills. It can be dangerous too,” Straubel said, noting that most landfill fires are caused by misplaced battery incidents. The U.S. must do a better of informing consumers about proper battery disposal and making disposal locations much more accessible, he said. “In the U.S., there aren’t strong programs or rules on this yet.” Magnet remanufacturing Apart from batteries, the other products dominated by China are high-performance magnets used in all kinds of electronics, including vehicles, drones, and missiles. These specialized magnets depend on rare earths that make up 17 of the 60 designated critical minerals. The only leading U.S. rare earths miner is MP Materials and its Mountain Pass mine in California. Now, MP Materials is focused on building out its magnet production and recycling capabilities. The U.S. Department of Defense even bought a 15% ownership stake in MP, and then the company inked a $500 million partnership with Apple to produce rare earths magnets from 100% recycled materials. “When you make a magnet, typically 20% to 50% of the material in the manufacturing and finishing process falls off the line in the form of waste. That’s a huge piece of your cost structure,” MP Materials CEO James Litinsky told Fortune. “If you have a refinery and the capability to bring that back into your business and recycle it, that’s a huge economic advantage.” That is the last part of what Litinsky calls the domestic vertical integration strategy—mining, refining, magnet production, and recycling. “Multibillion-dollar supply chains don’t move overnight, and it was very clear that this would take a long time. We’ve done it thoughtfully in stages,” Litinsky said. “You’re going to see us grow our recycling business because it’s critical to being an efficient magnetics business.”",right
"Bitcoin is struggling to stage a meaningful recovery after last month’s stumble, with signs of fatigue continuing to mount across crypto markets. The token briefly topped $107,000 on Monday before slipping back below $105,000, underscoring fragile sentiment after a broad selloff that erased billions in market value. The downturn was partly fueled by large holders taking profits near this year’s highs and lingering unease following the early-October liquidations. Momentum has yet to return. Open interest in Bitcoin perpetual futures sits around $68 billion, well below the $94 billion peak seen last month, while funding rates—a measure of leveraged positioning— remain flat. Flows into exchange-traded funds also show little enthusiasm. U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs drew just $1 million in net inflows on Monday, even as stocks and credit rallied after Washington moved to end the government shutdown. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin remains pinned below its 200-day moving average, now near $110,000—a threshold analysts see as key for any sustained upside move. Bitcoin has lost about $340 billion in market value since a surprise tariff announcement by Donald Trump triggered record liquidations on Oct. 10. Despite posting gains for the year, Bitcoin has lagged behind both gold and technology stocks, leaving it vulnerable to rotation by momentum-driven investors. Crypto assets did rise modestly alongside other risk assets following signs of progress in Washington, but the broader tone remains cautious. Here’s what market participants have to say about the choppy trading. George Mandres, senior trader at XBTO Trading: It feels like a dead cat bounce. Equities trade risk-on, with expectations that the U.S. government reopening can add more fuel to the rally. In crypto, the sentiment is different for now as the narrative around OG whales (early Bitcoin) buyers, selling a significant amount of coins has received a lot of mind-share. This supply, combined with the pressure on premium on digital asset treasury firms and the lack of new money coming to the space, as proxied by ETF inflows is affecting risk sentiment. Tony Sycamore, analyst, IG Australia: I think the most notable features over the past 24 hours is that Bitcoin has tracked the rally in risk assets higher after that correlation broke down last month. We would need to see this correlation hold in place for more than a session to say that the recent period of dislocation is over. But positive signs nonetheless. The other point is, technically—I could argue the correction from the $126,272 high is complete at the recent $98,898 low and that the uptrend has resumed. A sustained move above the 200-day moving average at around $110,000 would greatly increase conviction in this view. Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst, FxPro: The crypto market capitalization fell by 1.1%, cooling off after an impressive surge in the first half of Monday. The 50-day moving average near $3.62 trillion acted as technical resistance, and the market’s climb stalled at $3.6 trillion. Despite Monday’s impressive surge, the market may be forming a new, lower local maximum, continuing the downward trend that began just over a month ago. The market is clearly not ready to switch to a mode of frenzied optimism, continuing to take profits after growth impulses have been realized. The reduction in support from corporate buyers is having an impact. Rachael Lucas, analyst at BTC Markets: The recent lift in crypto prices looks like a classic short-covering rally, layered with a dash of institutional FOMO. Bitcoin bounced off key support at the 50-week SMA around $103,000 after testing lows near $98,900 and is now eyeing resistance at $110,400. If it breaks above that, we could see a run toward $115,600 to $118,000. On the downside, $103,000 remains a critical structural level. A break below that could open the door to $86,000, with deeper support at US$82,000 aligning with the 100-week SMA. Any slip below those zones could reignite selling pressure.",right
"New data the Agriculture Department released Friday created serious doubts about whether China will really buy millions of bushels of American soybeans like the Trump administration touted last month after a high-stakes meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The USDA report released after the government reopened showed only two Chinese purchases of American soybeans since the summit in South Korea that totaled 332,000 metric tons. That’s well short of the 12 million metric tons that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China agreed to purchase by January and nowhere near the 25 million metric tons she said they would buy in each of the next three years. American farmers were hopeful that their biggest customer would resume buying their crops. But CoBank’s Tanner Ehmke, who is its lead economist for grains and oilseed, said there isn’t much incentive for China to buy from America right now because they have plenty of soybeans on hand that they have bought from Brazil and other South American countries this year, and the remaining tariffs ensure that U.S. soybeans remain more expensive than Brazilian beans. “We are still not even close to what has been advertised from the U.S. in terms of what the agreement would have been,” Ehmke said. Beijing has yet to confirm any detailed soybean purchase agreement but only that the two sides have reached “consensus” on expanding trade in farm products. Ehmke said that even if China did promise to buy American soybeans it may have only agreed to buy them if the price was attractive. Trump said his team spoke with Chinese officials today and they assured the White House they would be purchasing more soybeans, but he didn’t offer any details of how much. “They’re in the process of doing not only a little bit but they’ll be doing a lot of soybean purchases,” he told reporters. The Chinese tariff on American beans remains high at about 24%, despite a 10-percentage-point reduction following the summit. Soybean prices fell sharply by 23 cents to $11.24 per bushel Friday. Ehmke said “that’s the market being shocked by the lack of Chinese demand that was confirmed in USDA data today.” Prices are still higher than they were before the agreement when they were selling for $10.60 per bushel, but the price may continue to drop unless there are significant new purchases. Before the trade agreement, Trump had promised farmers would receive an aid package to help them survive the trade war with China. That was put on hold during the shutdown, and now it’s not clear whether the administration will offer farmers aid like Trump did in his first administration. American farmers have been through this before after Trump’s first trade war with China. The trade agreementChina signed with the United States in 2020 promised massive purchases of U.S. crops. But the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted trade between the two nations just as the agreement went into effect. In 2022, U.S. farm exports to China hit a record, but then fell. Soybean prices are actually still a little higher than they were a year ago even without China’s normal purchases of roughly one-quarter of the U.S. crop. That’s because this year’s soybean crop is a little smaller while domestic demand remained strong with the continued growth in biodiesel production. But farmers are dealing with the soaring cost of fertilizer, seed, equipment and labor this year, and that is hurting their profits. The Kentucky farmer who is president of the American Soybean Association, Caleb Ragland, has said he worries that thousands of farmers could go out of business this year without significant Chinese purchases or government aid. Ragland said he’s still optimistic that China will follow through on the purchases, but it’s hard to be confident in that right now with so few sales reported. “We don’t want to assume they won’t. But it’s going to be a wonderful day when we actually deliver those soybeans, and when there’s my money in hand and so forth and the transaction’s complete,” Ragland said. China is the world’s largest buyer of soybeans. China bought more than $12.5 billion worth of the nearly $24.5 billion worth of U.S. soybeans that were exported last year. But China quit buying American soybeans this year after Trump imposed his tariffs and continued to shift more of their purchases over to South America. Even before the trade war, Brazilian beans accounted for more than 70% of China’s imports last year, while the U.S. share fell to 21%, World Bank data shows. Ragland said that every vender he talks to has told him they are increasing their prices for next year, which will continue to put pressure on farmers. “We’re still looking at sharp losses and the red ink as we figure budgets for 26 is still very much in play,” he said.",right
"It's Trump's economy now and Americans don't seem to love it President Donald Trump has been back in office long enough for Americans to expect at least glimmers of the economic golden age he promised. Instead, warning signals are flashing. President Donald Trump has been back in office long enough for Americans to expect at least glimmers of the economic golden age he promised. Instead, warning signals are flashing. They’re now coming from voters as well as from the patchy data available during a record-long government shutdown. The economy is expanding, but reliance on the artificial intelligence boom — and the stock-market wealth it’s generated — makes growth look lopsided. Democrats trounced Trump’s Republicans last week in elections where cost-of-living anxieties loomed large. Half of the respondents in an October survey by the Harris Poll for Bloomberg News said the economy wasn’t working for them – up from 41 per cent in February – and only one-third said their finances were better than a year ago. To be sure, analysts caution against reading too much into off-year ballots, and many Trump policies have yet to fully kick in. His tax cuts promise to boost business investment, which has already thrived in the race to build data centres — though there’s also a headwind from Trump’s trade wars, which led many firms to freeze capital spending. For now, with the job market cooling, consumer surveys and political polls find that Americans are downbeat about the economy and the president’s handling of it. Democratic candidates who campaigned on pocketbook issues won by big margins in Virginia and New Jersey governors’ races — tapping the same anxiety over high prices that helped Trump defeat Joe Biden, and that he’d promised to relieve from day one. “The economy remains resilient on the surface, but it’s increasingly dependent on three narrow, interconnected ‘A-pillars’: affluent consumers, artificial intelligence-fuelled investment and asset price gains,” wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon and president of the National Association for Business Economics. “If any one of these pillars weakens, the overall structure would become much less stable.” ‘Bearing fruit’ The president and his team acknowledged their overhaul wouldn’t bear fruit overnight – while also setting expectations for when it would. By the fourth quarter, “you will feel the power of Donald Trump’s economy,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television back in March. Now, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is shifting that timeline. “2026 is going to be a gangbuster year and Americans will feel it in their pocketbooks,” he told Fox Business last week. Trump himself has argued he’s already delivered on his promises, telling reporters “I don’t want to hear about the affordability” because prices are “much less.” On the growth front, what economists see right now is a slowdown capping Trump’s rollercoaster first year. U.S. gross domestic product shrank at the outset — thanks to a monumental import surge, as firms and consumers rushed to get ahead of tariffs — and then rebounded fast for a while. What the White House sees is a “gradual transition” underway between the Biden and Trump economies, according to Pierre Yared, acting chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. “The policies of the president are bearing fruit,” Yared said in a telephone interview. He pointed to three main metrics — overall growth, well-paying jobs, and building secure supply chains in America — as well as U.S. outperformance over peers like the European Union. The shutdown has delayed the release of September jobs data and other economic numbers. Alternative sources indicate anemic hiring. Unemployment is low but rising. Companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Target Corp. are laying off workers. One report shows U.S. firms announced the most job cuts for any October in more than two decades. Manufacturing in particular, where Trump promised a tariff-led renaissance, has struggled. It’s been in contraction for eight straight months and shed 42,000 jobs since April – the longest losing streak since the pandemic — after the president unveiled his global tariffs. Yared said what matters is the quality of jobs, and he pointed to a pickup in manufacturing productivity this year, as well as higher inflation-adjusted weekly pay in factories, mining and construction – all priority areas for the administration. In industries such as manufacturing, construction, agriculture and hospitality, the pool of available labour has shrunk in part because of Trump’s immigration crackdown. After a wave of raids and deportations, monthly border crossings — which surged under Biden — have plummeted close to zero. That’s left some employers struggling to find workers, though it also means fewer new jobs are required to keep unemployment steady. Still, the conservative American Enterprise Institute estimates that Trump’s policy shift will trim growth by as much as 0.4 percentage points this year. Surveys show Americans are worried about the job market — and the economy overall. RealClearPolitics polling averages for Trump’s approval ratings on the topic have declined sharply since he returned to office in January. Consumer sentiment this month plunged close to the lowest on record. Tariff whipsaw Trade has been at the top of Trump’s second-term agenda. The president has followed through on campaign promises to hike import taxes, with the goals of revitalizing manufacturing, erasing deficits with . .trading partners, and raising government revenue. The latter is happening: with U.S. tariffs now their highest in roughly a century, the Treasury Department is collecting around US$30 billion a month. Trump also touts the investments in the U.S. that companies and trade partners have pledged as a result of his dealmaking. But his on-and-off approach to imposing the duties – illustrated again last month when he dialed back charges on Chinese imports – has caused tremendous uncertainty, with many businesses halting investment and hiring decisions until they see where rates settle. The Supreme Court may yet have a say in that. At a hearing last week, justices appeared skeptical that Trump had the constitutional authority to impose his country-based tariffs, and a ruling could come by year’s end. Most economists expect the trade war will drag on growth next year, though the hit to consumer prices hasn’t been as big as anticipated. Stubborn prices At three per cent, the headline inflation rate is roughly where it was when Trump took office, after prices surged a cumulative 20 per cent under Biden in the pandemic aftermath. Business expectations for prices in the year ahead are holding steady, and the worst fears of consumers appear to have eased in recent months. Even so, complaints about the cost of living helped Democrats score double-digit wins in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races. One sore point in both states, and potentially nationwide in next year’s midterm voting, was the climb in electricity prices – new among America’s hot-button political issues. Trump and Bessent put cheaper energy at the heart of their program. They have cited this year’s drop in gasoline costs, and argued deregulation will lower them further. But the administration’s AI push may inflate electric bills because data centres need vast amounts of power. And while the AI giants enjoy tariff exemptions for key equipment, electricity generators aren’t so favoured – raising the risk that capacity will fall behind demand and add to price pressures. ‘Undeniably awesome’ One place where AI is definitely lifting prices is America’s stock market. The S&P 500 Index has added some US$8 trillion in value this year, overcoming a spring slump triggered by Trump’s tariffs. The so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech giants are driving it. Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, recently became the world’s first $5 trillion company. All that new equity wealth has boosted consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of demand in the economy – but also skewed it toward the rich. Households in the top 10 per cent of the income distribution accounted for 49.2 per cent of spending in the second quarter, the highest share in data going back to 1989, according to Moody’s Analytics. Meanwhile there are signs that lower-income Americans are cutting back. It’s left some analysts talking about a “K-shape” economy almost a year into Trump’s second term – one in which some households and industries thrive while others struggle. “If you live in the upper spur of the ‘K,’ things are undeniably awesome,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM U.S. “But if you live and work in the lower spur of the ‘K,’ you’re stressed, things are at risk. And it seems like the economy’s becoming more insecure for people who live in that realm.” —With assistance from Vince Golle, Gregory Korte and Alex McIntyre.

"What's missing from the Carney government's first federal budget OTTAWA — Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first federal budget represents a shift in policy from Justin Trudeau as the Liberals bet that major investments in an economic transformation will pay off with much-needed growth. The spending plan announced Tuesday include billions of dollars for infrastructure and new tax opportunities for businesses, alongside previously outlined plans to reduce government costs, including through job cuts. Business lobbies, not-for-profits and other groups have spent the past few months pitching the government on what they’d like to see in the budget, but no spending plan can address every item on the national wish list. Here’s a look at what is not in the budget: PHARMACARE “Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, we are protecting the vital services Canadians rely on, including child care, dental care, and pharmacare,” Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said in his House of Commons speech introducing the budget, Yet there’s no indication in the budget that there’s more money for the pharmacare program beyond the $1.5 billion over five years previously earmarked for the first phase project in 2024. To date, the federal government has spent more than 60 per cent of that money and has deals with just four provinces and territories. Carney has said he’s committed to finalizing deals with the remaining jurisdictions as quickly and equitably as possible, but it’s unclear how that will work. ENVIRONMENT Carney scrapped the consumer carbon tax after taking office in the first signal his government would take a different approach to environmental policy than Trudeau’s. Consumers were waiting for clarity on two measures — a rebate on electric vehicles and incentives for homeowners hoping to make their homes more energy efficient. Previous funding for both those measures ran out ahead of schedule. Carney has promised both and automakers are annoyed at the promised return of rebates not materializing, saying consumers are holding off buying electric vehicles while waiting for the rebates to bring the price down. SECTOR-SPECIFIC AID The industries hardest hit by U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies, including steel and aluminum, the auto sector and lumber, were likely holding out hope there would be additional measures to help them financially after a difficult year. Some manufacturers will benefit from government procurement, which intends to buy Canadian materials for infrastructure, home construction and other major projects, but there wasn’t any new money for tariff-hit companies or industries. INDIVIDUAL RELIEF Federal budgets in the past have included new small targeted programs and tax credits for individual groups of Canadians, but the government’s spending plan this year offers relatively little aimed at individuals. After cancelling the consumer carbon price and lowering income taxes earlier this year, the budget instead focuses on lower costs for Canadians overall by increasing competition and boosting the broader economy. The federal government cut the income tax rate for the lowest bracket effective July 1. The tax cut is expected to mean savings of up to $420 per person a year in 2026.

"The company that makes brands such as Sharpie, Mr. Coffee, Yankee Candle, and Graco said Monday it will slim its workforce to be more competitive. Newell Brands said the plan is “designed to strengthen the company’s competitiveness, deliver greater value for consumers and drive long-term value creation.” Newell then laid out how it will achieve that goal: As part of the plan, the company will reduce its global workforce by over 900 employees (approximately 10% of professional and clerical employees), with limited impact on manufacturing or supply chain operations. Professional and clerical separations in the United States are largely expected to occur this month, with international actions continuing through 2026, subject to local law and consultation requirements. In addition, the company is closing about 20 Yankee Candle stores in the United States and Canada. Those closures are expected to happen in January. Newell Brands also owns other well-known names including Ball, Rubbermaid, Sunbeam, and CrockPot. The restructuring is expected to cost up to $90 million. In a statement, President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Peterson explained, “We’ve made meaningful progress executing our strategy and strengthening Newell Brands, but there is more work to do. This productivity plan is about taking the next, disciplined step to enhance efficiency, sharpen our strategic focus, and deliver stronger, more consistent performance. Ultimately, our goal is to deliver greater value for consumers and create sustained long-term value for our shareholders.” According to Reuters, the CEO said in February the company was working to not be so reliant on Chinese suppliers amid President Donald Trump’s tariff policies that are aimed at strengthening the U.S. economy. “The Sharpie maker, which partly manufactures and sources products from China, said it plans to bring down the cost of finished goods imported to the U.S. to less than 10% from around 15% of the company’s total cost of goods sold by the end of the year,” the Reuters article stated. The Sharpie pens are manufactured in Tennessee, according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which also noted their felt tips are the only piece imported and they come from Japan. “It didn’t used to be this way. Back in 2018, many Sharpies were made abroad. That’s when Chris Peterson, who was the CFO of Sharpie maker Newell Brands, challenged his team to answer a question: How could they keep Newell from becoming obsolete compared with factories in Asia?” the article continued. “‘I felt like we had an opportunity to dramatically improve our U.S. manufacturing,’ he said. Peterson is now the CEO. And these days, most Sharpies—in all 93 colors—are made at this 37-year-old factory. Newell did it without reducing the employee count, and without raising prices,” the newspaper stated, adding, “But to get to this place took close to $2 billion in investments across the company, thousands of hours of training and a total overhaul of the production process.” COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) scolded President Donald Trump on Monday for giving Brazil “the middle finger” by daring to impose tariffs on the South American nation. Newsom, speaking at a Milken Institute event in São Paulo ahead of the COP30 climate doomer summit, lashed out at Trump for not participating in the conference hosted by the Brazilian government at the city of Belém. “The hell’s going on in my country? Not one person from the administration. Show any respect to any of you. Forget politics. Disrespect. We’re in Brazil. One of our great trading partners. One of the world’s great democracies,” Newsom said. “I mean, hell, home to all the — you need rare earth minerals. This is the country we should be engaging in. Instead, middle finger with 50 percent tariffs. That’s shameful. Forgive me. That’s an aside. Sorry,” he continued. Newsom is presently visiting Brazil and is expected to travel to Belém this Tuesday to participate in COP30. The California governor told Politico he and his team were getting a “disproportionate number of calls” to meet on the sidelines of the event. Like many other international heads of state, Trump did not attend last week’s COP30 Summit hosted by leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a two-day presidential gathering that served as an opening event to the broader series of COP30-related activities that will run in Belém through Friday, November 21. The United States government did not send any high-level representative to the ongoing climate doom conference. Newsom told Politico that “not even a note taker” was sent by the U.S. government. “We’re at peak influence because of the flatness of the surrounding terrain with the Trump administration and all the anxiety,” Newson reportedly asserted. RELATED: Zeldin — Newsom and Bass “Need to Get Off of Their Asses” and Rebuild from L.A. Fires Politico reported in addition to holding meetings with German and Chilean representatives, Newsom is expected to give plenary remarks and will then visit the Amazon rainforest to meet with indigenous communities. Asked by Brazilian press on whether he would run for president, Newsom answered, “Nothing else matters but 2026 and taking back the House of Representatives.” In July, President Trump signed an executive order identifying Brazil as a national security threat and imposed a 50 percent tariff on the country, citing the political persecution of conservative former President Jair Bolsonaro and the numerous acts of persecution and censorship committed by Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. De Moraes and other members of the top court sentenced Bolsonaro to 27 years in prison for “crimes against democracy.” At press time, the court has not determined which reclusion center Bolsonaro will serve the sentence at. The former president, presently under a strict house arrest, was diagnosed with skin cancer in August. After months of continued refusal, Lula finally met with Trump in late October to discuss tariffs. COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format Just a day later, U.S. President Donald Trump responded to China's actions by announcing 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods, effective November 1. He also unveiled new export restrictions on ‘critical software.’ China’s Rare-earth restrictions, imposed on materials, Know-how, products, and services, crippled the defence, aerospace, nuclear, EV, and semiconductor industries across the US and Europe. According to official estimates, the impact in Germany alone will be around €400. The effect in the US will be much more profound. The Minerals That Power the Modern World Rare Earths, often overlooked, are the unsung heroes of the digital age. They are the invisible backbone of modern industry, from smartphones and semiconductors to electric vehicles, satellites, solar panels, wind turbines, fibre optic networks, communication systems, drones, medical equipment, and defence systems. Their unique magnetic, catalytic, and luminescent properties make them indispensable for modern high-tech enterprises in energy, economy, defence, and space.China dominates this domain like no other. It controls 70 per cent of global raw materials, 83 per cent of processing technology, and 92 per cent of finished products. This supremacy stems from the 1980s, when the U.S. abandoned rare-earth mining and processing due to environmental concerns, mistakenly classifying them as thorium. China embraced it, endured the environmental hazards and the human costs, and built a monopoly, positioning itself to preside over this new Great Game. The dominance that now haunts the very nation that once nurtured them is evident. Rare Earths and National Security These 17 elements of the rare Earth components are, by and large, converted into a single dominant finished product called Permanent Magnets or simply Magnets. For simplification, Rare Earth Elements can be considered as synonymous with Magnets. The scale of the consumption of magnets in defence is staggering; while an electric car needs 3 to 5 kilograms of magnets, an F-35 fighter jet requires nearly 400 kilograms, and a submarine needs about 4 tonnes of magnets. These aren’t mere components—they are the hidden force behind electric systems, thermal stability, laser precision, optical systems, heat resistance, agility, and survivability in modern warfare. Without Magnets, the hardware of contemporary warfare would quite literally fall apart. They are equally crucial for space technologies to withstand harsh, unpredictable environments.Following initial tariff threats and political turmoil, Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping struck a one-year truce on October 30, 2025, at the APEC summit in Busan, suspending export controls and punitive tariffs. This de-escalatory pause grants the US and its allies breathing room to hasten supply-chain diversification. However, China's dominance will remain unchallenged for a long time to come, as countering its monopoly will not be easy. Beijing could undercut global efforts by dumping processed minerals at artificially low prices, discouraging foreign investment in mining and research. The Road Ahead for India For India too, this development carries significant economic and strategic implications, underscoring the need for a swift and well-coordinated policy response. India relies entirely on imports to meet its magnet demand, with official data showing 26,000 metric tonnes imported in 2023. This figure is projected to double by 2030 due to rising industrial needs. Currently, Midwest Advanced Materials, based in Hyderabad, is the sole domestic producer and is set to supply 500 metric tonnes of Rare Earth magnets annually starting January 2026. The remaining demand continues to be fulfilled through imports, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced domestic production.India’s rare earth elements are primarily found in monazite, bastnaesite, and allanite deposits. Monazite, for instance, is abundantly available in coastal beach sands, with Andhra Pradesh holding around 3.69 million tonnes, Odisha 3.06 million tonnes, Tamil Nadu 2.46 million tonnes, and Kerala 1.84 million tonnes — for a total of roughly 11 million tonnes nationwide. Bastnaesite and allanite, on the other hand, are concentrated in the mountain rocks of Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Karnataka, and Gujarat. Among these, monazite represents the predominant and most accessible source of Rare Earths. Yet, the full chemical characteristics of India’s monazite deposits remain insufficiently studied. This lack of detailed information has been a significant barrier to the development of domestic processing technologies. Kerala is the first state to take the lead in commissioning a pilot project to study the chemical characteristics of Monazite available to them. The Government of India should lead from the front by persuading other states to initiate pilot projects in line with Kerala, and simultaneously commence commercial production. In a swift strategic move, the government of India has launched the PLI scheme to address the economic viability gap and spur magnet production —an essential but insufficient step. The production target of 6000 tonnes under the PLI scheme will be unrealistic unless the supply chain is strengthened by involving state government agencies where monazite deposits are available. India urgently needs a high-powered Rare Earth Commission, modelled on the Atomic Energy Commission, by reorganising the decades-old Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL) set up to focus on nuclear fuel extraction with Rare Earths as byproducts. This initiative will prioritise Rare Earths development and exploration, spearhead R&D, advance process technology, forge international partnerships to secure critical supply chains, develop alternative technologies, and build a strategic ecosystem in the backdrop of shifting geopolitical dynamics. Research is already underway in the US and elsewhere to develop technologies as alternatives to Rare-earth components. Nevertheless, we must develop robust strategies to counter such tactics. Having missed the Industrial Revolution and endured decades of energy scarcity, India cannot afford to lag behind in the ongoing high-tech revolution. As China wields rare earths as both an economic and geopolitical weapon, India faces a critical choice: act decisively now or risk strategic dependence that could severely undermine its economy, energy security, and national security.

Management uses these financial measures for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of ongoing operations and in analyzing the Company’s business performance and trends. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company’s results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s financial information reported under IFRS. The Company uses the following non-IFRS financial measures: “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Adjusted net earnings”, the most directly comparable financial measure for each that is disclosed in its financial statements being net earnings, “normalized gross profit”, “normalized SG&A”, “normalized earnings from operations”, “cash from operating activities before working capital considerations” and “net debt”, the most directly comparable financial measures for each that is disclosed in its financial statements being gross profit, SG&A, earnings from operations, cash flows from operating activities, and long-term debt, respectively, the following non-IFRS ratios: “Adjusted EBITDA margin”, “Adjusted diluted earnings per share”, “normalized gross profit margin”, “normalized operating margin”, and the following supplementary financial measures: “gross profit margin” and “operating margin” to provide supplemental measures of the Company’s operating performance and thus highlight trends in the Company’s core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also uses non-IFRS and supplementary financial measures in order to prepare annual operating budgets and to determine components of management compensation. For an explanation of the composition of each such measure and the usefulness and additional uses of each by management, see the “How we Assess the Performance of our Business” section of the MD&A, which is incorporated by reference. See below for a quantitative reconciliation of each non-IFRS financial measure to its most directly comparable financial measure disclosed in the Company’s financial statements to which the measure relates. The following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of net earnings to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net earnings, as well as gross profit to normalized gross profit, SG&A to normalized SG&A, earnings from operations to normalized earnings from operations and net debt, each of which are non-IFRS financial measures (see the “Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures” of this press release for further information on each non-IFRS financial measure) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.

"Eby says B.C. won't run anti-tariff ads alone as it had planned VANCOUVER — British Columbia Premier David Eby says the province won’t be running a series of anti-tariff advertisements for the American public on its own. Eby, speaking alongside Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, said the shift in strategy is to ensure communications with U.S. authorities are aligned with federal officials as they discuss softwood lumber tariffs from the United States. “Minister LeBlanc didn’t have to ask,” Eby answered Monday when a reporter asked LeBlanc if he requested that the B.C. government hold off on its anti-tariff advertising campaign. “I knew that it was a source of anxiety for many people, including potentially the federal government.” The decision comes after U.S. President Donald Trump last month blamed an anti-tariff ad campaign by Ontario for his cancellation of trade talks with Canada. The premier said the planned ad campaign by B.C. came up at the Vancouver summit on how to prop up the forest industry in the face of American fees and tariffs. “Given the reaction to the Ontario tariffs, one of my commitments to the federal government was that if they came to the table with us, if they sat with us, that we would work with them on communications, on strategy, on how to support the sector and how to move forward,” he said as the meeting wrapped up. He said LeBlanc and his team wanted an “integrated approach” and B.C. will ensure future communications are in line when it comes to speaking with the Americans. Eby said that the forest industry in Canada is larger than the automotive sector and it deserves to be treated with respect. After the meeting Monday, he said he’s confident the federal government understands that. “This was very heartening to me. I felt like we were going it alone there for a while, and to know that we’ve got this federal team in our corner is hugely helpful to me and resulted in our commitment to work forward in terms of any communications with Americans with the federal government.” In September, the Trump administration imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Canadian companies ranging from 26 per cent to more than 47 per cent, then threatened to add another 10 per cent last month, claiming Canada’s industry is a risk to U.S. national security. Eby announced that there will be a working group to set out supports for the sector. Kim Haakstad, the president of the BC Council of Forest Industries, said in a statement that the group is pleased the governments are working together to keep people working — even when markets are challenging. Haakstad said the working group should also include the industry to help focus on keeping mills open and people working, which means prioritizing a new softwood lumber deal and accelerating the rollout of the $1.2 billion the federal government has already set aside for the industry.

"India's retail inflation plunged to 0.25% - the lowest since the current series began in 2013 - but the figure alone may not warrant a rate cut. The proximate reason for the October print is cooling food prices, and interest rate setters are wont to look through the headline number to core inflation. The adverse base effects from the year-ago period are about to wear off, and inflation may be at a point of inflection during this quarter. Effects of lower GST rates are showing up on the price line, but this is a one-off development. More important is the effect of the tax changes on consumption, which is expected to prop up demand. The economy shows little sign of slowing, and a likely trade resolution with the US could further lift growth. RBI revised its growth projection upwards in October, factoring in the current inflation trajectory while keeping the interest rate unchanged. High-frequency data show the economy remains on track, with no need for premature action. The central bank has front-loaded its interest rate cuts, and residual action will be measured. The income and consumption tax cuts must work their way through the system before fresh monetary easing is called for. It is too close to call the December meeting of MPC. Inflation is below RBI's target band for a second consecutive month. The latest full-year inflation forecast, however, is placed within the permissible range. Core inflation does not offer much headroom for rate cuts, so their timing should be decided for maximum impact. Tariff negotiations with the US add another element of fluidity to the calculation. So, although macroeconomic conditions have opened space for monetary policy to support growth, that support may not be needed immediately. The scope for rate cuts has opened during MPC meetings in December and February. Yet, it does not seem that RBI is in any hurry while it keeps the liquidity tap open.

"The Fed Was Misled by Its Tarifflation Convictions The Federal Reserve spent 2025 worried about the wrong problem. All year, officials treated President Trump’s tariffs as an inflation threat, a supply shock that risked pushing prices higher and complicating the central bank’s effort to bring inflation back to target. When the administration announced broad duties on foreign goods, the Fed’s instinct was caution: don’t cut rates too quickly, watch for tariff-related price pressures, keep policy tight enough to guard against a potential inflation flare-up. “Higher tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods, resulting in higher overall inflation,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at his press conference in late October. “A reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short lived—a one-time shift in the price level. But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed.” Back in July, he explicitly said the Fed was holding back on rate cuts because of tariffs. “In effect we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs,” Powell said. “Essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs.” It was the sort of reasoning that sounds prudent. But it was also, according to new economic research, exactly backward. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell attends the Federal Reserve Board open meeting in Washington, DC, on Oct. 24, 2025. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Tariffs Are Disinflationary The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank has just published a sweeping historical study of tariff policy stretching back 150 years. The study, by economists Régis Barnichon and Aayush Singh, examines major tariff hikes in the United States, Britain, and France, at moments when governments, like the Trump administration, significantly raised barriers to imports. Their finding is stark and runs directly against the Fed’s stance: tariff increases are followed by lower inflation and higher unemployment, not the reverse. A typical large tariff hike—roughly a four percentage-point rise in the average tariff rate—shows up in the pre-World War II historical record as associated with about two percentage points less inflation and one percentage point more unemployment. The authors of the paper admit that they do not know exactly how this works but note that it is akin to what you would expect from a decline in demand. That is the opposite of what the Federal Reserve told itself about tariffs in 2025. To understand how consequential this misreading is, start with a simple principle: when policymakers get the sign of an economic shock wrong, when they mistake its direction, they naturally respond in the wrong direction too. The Fed saw tariffs and thought: inflation risk. That judgment led it to be cautious about rate cuts, to second-guess aggressive easing, to treat any sign of economic strength as a reason to hold back. If tariffs genuinely were inflationary, that would make sense. Keep policy tight. Guard against a wage-price spiral. Don’t loosen just because there are downside risks showing up in the labor market. But if the San Francisco Fed’s 150-year study is right, tariffs push the economy in the opposite direction. They’re disinflationary. They weaken employment while pushing prices down, perhaps because demand weakens or perhaps because they shift the economy onto a higher productivity path. One way to understand this is that tariffs appear to act, in effect, like an extra monetary tightening that the central bank should offset with easier money, not reinforce with caution. So, the Fed in 2025 faced a tariff shock that was already pulling inflation down and unemployment up. Its response was to keep policy tighter than it otherwise would have. The result was two tightenings working in the same direction—tariffs pushing down on employment and prices, and the Fed also pushing down for fear of the inflation that never came. The Fed was so convinced of its view that tariffs are inflationary that it ignored evidence to the contrary. Prices of durable goods are up 1.8 percent from a year ago, hardly a scarily inflationary trend. Prices of major appliances are down 1.6 percent. Apparel prices are down 0.1 percent. New car prices have climbed 1.2 percent, and new truck prices inched up 0.7 percent. The Fed looked at all this and concluded that it just meant tariff inflation was still looming. A Policy Error That Cries Out for Correction You don’t need to think this produced a catastrophe to see the error. It means the Fed likely held rates higher than necessary for longer than was optimal. The labor market cooled more than it needed to. The housing market remains frozen because of high rates. Some of the disinflation achieved in 2025 came not just from the tariffs themselves but from the Fed’s decision to treat tariffs as inflationary and hold back on cuts. If the Fed had correctly seen tariff hikes as disinflationary shocks that modestly weaken the demand for labor, the response would be to ease monetary policy more aggressively, not less. The mantra would shift from “tariffs are a reason to be cautious about rate cuts” to “tariffs are doing some of the Fed’s tightening work for us, so we should do less ourselves.” Instead of asking, “How do we keep inflation from spiking because of tariffs?” the Fed would ask, “How do we offset the disinflationary and employment-dampening effects of tariffs with easier monetary policy?” Those are radically different questions. They lead to radically different policy paths. In practice, this would have meant the Federal Reserve cutting rates more decisively in 2025, leaning harder against the labor market softening effects of the tariff shock, and treating the tariff-plus-lower-rates combination as complementary rather than contradictory. The Fed would have been a partner in an economic program, rather than a skeptic holding back against it. The question now is whether Fed officials are willing and able to update their views to reflect the research or whether they’ll keep making the same mistake.

"High coffee prices are here to stay for U.S. consumers despite tariff cuts The cost of Arabica coffee beans surged to a record last month Coffee lovers hoping for quick relief from historically high prices may have to wait longer as the expected pullback from a reduction in U.S. tariffs has yet to materialize, according to Italian roaster Illycaffe SpA. The company, known for the high-end espresso sold in silver-and-red cans, plans to raise prices again in January after two increases this year, Chief Executive Officer Cristina Scocchia said in an interview. The cost of Arabica coffee beans surged to a record last month when U.S. tariffs on top exporter Brazil coincided with lackluster harvests across the globe. Prices have eased slightly since U.S. President Donald Trump expanded tariff breaks for Brazilian coffee, but still remain at historically high levels. “There is a limit to how much a company can absorb a level of green coffee price, which is so unhealthily high,” Scocchia said, referring to the surge in unroasted bean costs. “We’ll increase the price in all the countries and in all the channels.” Illycaffe’s moves are likely to be matched by other roasters, because consumer prices are still catching up with the commodity costs. Any hikes in prices of coffee on grocery store shelves tend to lag by “many months” or at times even a year, according to Carlos Mera, head of agricultural commodity market research at Rabobank. He’s expecting to see more price gains in the coming months. Illycaffe predicts prices for unroasted beans will stabilize between US$2.80 to US$3 a pound within the second half of 2026, which is still above the average of the past five years. “We were hoping for a much more dramatic drop,” Scocchia said in a telephone interview. The coffee industry is facing a “very, very difficult” situation due to the persistently high prices of unroasted beans, which she attributed more to speculation than actual supply issues. - Trump tariff cut may ease pain for U.S. coffee lovers - Coffee gains as Brazilian stocks in exchange warehouses shrink - Advertisement 1Story continues below The company maintained its sourcing strategy from Brazil during the period when U.S. tariffs were in place, as it has unique blends that require the country’s coffee. It’s now planning to enter production partnerships in the U.S., which accounts for 20 per cent of its turnover. Illycaffe has tried to limit the impact on consumers by absorbing a significant portion of the cost increase within its margins, helping boost its sales volumes. Despite the high prices, coffee demand has remained resilient, with the company expecting the market to continue to grow at a single-digit rate.

"Bitcoin’s shaky October extended into the first week of November, as the broader outlook for crypto appears to be souring. On Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price dipped about 21% since its all-time high last month to roughly $99,000, while other cryptocurrencies fell even more sharply. And while Bitcoin has since clawed back over the key psychological $100,000 mark, some think the crypto sector’s remarkable run may be over for the time being. The declines for Bitcoin and for other cryptocurrencies have been especially sharp over the past week. As of Thursday, Bitcoin slightly recovered to just under $103,000 but is still down roughly 5% in the last week. Ethereum is down roughly 12% to just under $3,372, and Solana is down about 19% to just under $158 during that time. Ethereum and Solana—the most prominent non-Bitcoin currencies known as alt-coins—hit record prices earlier in the year but have come down significantly. The former has plummeted roughly 30% since August, while the latter is down about 41% since January. Bitcoin boosters like to tout the asset as an independent gold-like store of value but, as it has in the past, the price has softened along with the rest of the economy. In the last week, the crypto market’s stumble has coincided with uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s direction, and a decline in the S&P 500. Meanwhile, the crypto market is still recovering from a flash crash on October 10 where traders experienced the worst crypto liquidation event in history, according to the analytics company CoinGlass. That day, exchanges liquidated more than $19 billion in leveraged positions. The flash crash followed Trump’s Truth Social post in which he said the U.S. would impose a 100% tariff on China, “over and above” any tariff they were already paying. “The current weakness reflects a mix of [an ongoing effort by markets to digest] 10/10, slightly more hawkish Fed tone, and a broader risk-off across assets,” said Jasper De Maere, an OTC Trader at Wintermute. Comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also affected crypto markets. At the end of last month, he hinted that the October rate cut could be the last one of the year. He said his colleagues had “strongly differing views” about future rate cuts and that, “there’s a growing chorus now of feeling like maybe this is where we should at least wait a cycle.” In the 24 hours following those comments, Bitcoin and Ethereum dipped about 1.6% and 2%, respectively. On Tuesday, when Bitcoin slipped under $100k, many on social media were quick to voice their concern. a lot of you today pic.twitter.com/YxM5qImeLy— Aubrey Strobel (@aubreystrobel) November 4, 2025 Me after bitcoin dipped under 100k: pic.twitter.com/PFiMWfA7g6 — Zpeedy (@Zpeedycryptosol) November 4, 2025 Some analysts also believe that crypto might be struggling for a while, “[Many long-term holders] who adhere to the four-year cycle theory…are selling positions, convinced that we are at or near the cycle top,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.

"Most Canadians say U.S. trade deal unlikely in any time soon 67% of Canadians say it’s unlikely a deal to lower U.S. tariffs Canadians have little faith a trade deal with the U.S. will be reached in the next six months, after U.S. President Donald Trump blew up talks over an anti-tariff ad campaign launched by the province of Ontario. Some 67 per cent of Canadians say it’s unlikely a deal to lower U.S. tariffs will be achieved over the next half-year, according to a poll by Nanos Research Group for Bloomberg News. About 28 per cent say it’s likely and three per cent are unsure. Trump halted all trade talks with Canada in late October over Ontario’s ad, which used excerpts from a radio address by former President Ronald Reagan. Prime Minister Mark Carney said negotiations had been progressing toward a deal on steel, aluminum and energy. The survey suggests Canadians may be understanding of Carney’s inability so far to reach a deal with the mercurial U.S. president. Still, their patience may wear thin the longer the trade impasse continues and as the economic pain grows. Trump’s sectoral tariffs on Canadian metals, autos and softwood lumber have forced job losses and chilled business investment. He’s also imposed levies on many goods that don’t comply with the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement he signed in his first term, adding to uncertainty. Carney apologized to Trump for the ad campaign, though the prime minister was not involved in its creation — the premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, spearheaded the strategy. Ford ultimately pulled the ads, but only after they aired during the first two games of the World Series. Trump also threatened to add an additional 10 per cent tariff on Canadian goods over the ads, though the levy has yet to materialize. It’s not the first time the Carney government has appeared to edge close to a deal before talks collapsed. - Key Supreme Court justices question Trump's global tariffs - Trump tariffs’ fate rides on Supreme Court justices - Advertisement 1Story continues below Carney was elected in April on a promise to negotiate a comprehensive economic and security agreement with the U.S. In June, he set a deadline of mid-July to reach a deal, but Trump called off the talks over Canada’s plan to implement a digital services tax on large technology companies. Carney scrapped the tax so talks could resume, but the countries blew past the deadline nonetheless and Trump hiked tariffs on Aug. 1. After Carney visited the White House in early October, talks intensified on a deal that would have offered some relief on steel and aluminum tariffs, potentially in exchange for greater access to Canadian energy. But Trump’s outrage over Ontario’s ad ended those discussions. Carney recently acknowledged a comprehensive deal was unlikely before CUSMA comes up for review in July 2026. Canada, Mexico and the U.S. have all kicked off a public consultation process ahead of that review, which is widely expected to turn into a full renegotiation. But Canadians are also feeling gloomy about the future of that deal, the poll suggests. Some 60% believe it will be renewed with major or minor changes, while 30 per cent expect it will be scrapped completely. The agreement is crucial to maintaining tariff-free access to the U.S. market for the vast majority of Canadian goods. But Trump has already violated its terms by imposing sectoral tariffs. He’s said the U.S. does not want to buy cars from Canada, and he’s also complained about other industries protected by CUSMA, such as Canadian dairy. The poll of 1,045 Canadians was conducted online and by phone from Oct. 27 to Oct. 30, and has a margin of error of three percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

"Euro-Zone Inflation Near 2% to Seal Deal on ECB Rate Hold A euro-zone inflation reading that’s likely to stay close to 2% should be enough to satisfy officials that they can avoid tweaking interest rates in December. (Bloomberg) — A euro-zone inflation reading that’s likely to stay close to 2% should be enough to satisfy officials that they can avoid tweaking interest rates in December. Consumer prices probably rose 2.1% in November from a year earlier, according to the median of 29 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey ahead of Tuesday’s release. The underlying measure, which strips out volatile elements such as energy, is seen remaining at 2.4%. Such readings for the final inflation numbers before the European Central Bank’s Dec. 18 decision might harden the resolve of policymakers to keep borrowing costs unchanged. That would leave them able to focus instead on their pivotal quarterly forecasts, featuring the first outlook stretching as far as 2028. Officials find themselves in a holding pattern at present, with no clear consensus on what the next move for rates should be. Mixed signals from national reports on Friday might feed that sense of ambiguity, after stronger-than-expected inflation in Germany and Spain was balanced by weaker-than-anticipated numbers for France and Italy. If there’s any bias within the Governing Council at present, it might be toward scouring the data for upward pressure on price growth. Vice President Luis de Guindos told Bloomberg Television on Nov. 26 that “the risk of undershooting is limited, in my view.” President Christine Lagarde, who’s repeatedly highlighted the good position that policy is currently at, may offer her own perspective in testimony to lawmakers in Brussels on Wednesday. The unresolved sense of direction from the ECB is being mirrored by conflicting views from economists. Bloomberg Economics, for example, predicts inflation will slow in future months, adding to the case for rate cuts. What Bloomberg Economics Says: “Euro-area inflation will likely remain steady in November at just above the central bank’s 2% target, before resuming a sustained deceleration in December. That may add pressure on the ECB to ease policy next year, even though the Governing Council is currently resisting such a move.” —Simona Delle Chiaie and David Powell. For full analysis, click here BNP Paribas, in a recent note, offered a different take. “As we move into 2026, we expect the ECB to see stronger growth and inflation than it currently expects, which should further strengthen the case for a prolonged rate hold,” wrote Paul Hollingsworth, the bank’s head of developed markets economics. “We continue to see the next move as a hike.” Elsewhere, the Paris-based OECD will release new forecasts on Tuesday, a consumer-price gauge is coming from the US, policymakers in the UK will share their financial-stability assessment, and Brazil may come to the end of its longest streak of growth in decades. Click here for what happened in the past week, and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy. US and Canada Federal Reserve officials will get a dated reading on their preferred inflation gauge before settling in the following week for their final policy meeting of the year. On Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis releases its September income and spending report — long delayed because of the government shutdown. The figures will include the personal consumption expenditures price index and a core measure that excludes food and energy. Economists project a third-straight 0.2% increase in the core index. That would keep the year-over-year figure hovering just below 3%, a sign that inflationary pressures are stable, yet sticky and above the Fed’s goal. Against such a backdrop, the debate among officials will largely center on the job market and whether rates should be reduced for a third straight time when policymakers meet Dec. 9-10. Investors see a cut as more likely than not. Fed policymakers are in their usual pre-meeting quiet period. Still, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday, where he touted a positive market response to indications that Donald Trump could pick the next Fed chair before the end of the year — a job that the president’s chief economic adviser is seen as likely to win. - Read more: Fed Contender Hassett Says Market Is Ready for Trump Chair Pick While the latest jobs report showed a larger-than-expected rise in payrolls, the gain was concentrated in just a few industries. The unemployment rate ticked up to an almost four-year high, and there’s been a steady drumbeat of layoff news from companies. Other economic data in the coming week include ADP private employment figures for November, as well as Institute for Supply Management surveys of manufacturers and service providers. The Fed is also scheduled to release September industrial production figures. - For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for the US In Canada, meanwhile, jobs data for November are expected to show persistent weakness as the US trade war batters key industries and weighs on broader hiring. Some analysts see employers shedding staff after two strong reports made up for losses over the summer. The Bank of Canada plans to hold its policy rate steady at 2.25% as long as the economy and inflation evolve as expected, and it foresees a soft labor market with weak wage growth. Asia Asia steps into the first week of December with a packed calendar — led by a wave of manufacturing purchasing manager indexes along with price indicators that will help gauge the region’s momentum into year-end. Data published Sunday showed that China’s factory activity improved but remained in contraction in November, extending its streak of declines to a record as the country’s economic slowdown deepens. The tone will also be shaped by remarks from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda on Monday, with markets alert to any signals on the likelihood of a December rate hike. Australia begins the week with housing data that’s expected to confirm another month of gains, alongside a run of third-quarter figures — including company profits and inventories — ahead of its GDP release on Wednesday, when South Korea publishes its revised figures too. Also on Monday, Japan issues a broad set of quarterly indicators, covering capital spending, sales, and profits, that will feed into GDP revisions the following week. Indonesia reports inflation and trade data. A sweep of PMIs from across Asia — including Australia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam — will offer an early reading on factory conditions as global demand remains uneven. The start of the week coincides with the start of December, which means Anna Breman begins her five-year term as New Zealand’s central bank chief. Breman, who is from Sweden, Breman becomes the first female governor and the first foreigner to lead the institution since Englishman Leslie Lefeaux was its inaugural head in 1934. - Read more: Breman ‘Gifted’ Ideal Economy as She Takes Charge at the RBNZ Tuesday brings New Zealand’s third-quarter terms of trade, followed by South Korea’s inflation for November. Australia reports its current account balance as well as government spending for the September quarter. Thursday features Japan’s weekly portfolio-investment flows and Australia’s household-spending for October, together with the latest trade numbers. Attention turns to India on Friday, where the country’s central bank is expected to lower the repurchase, or repo, rate, making borrowing cheaper for banks and in turn for households and businesses. Also on Friday, South Korea releases current account data, Japan has household spending, while the Philippines and Taiwan report inflation readings for November. Singapore’s retail-sales report will show whether the improvement seen last quarter carried into October. - For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for Asia Europe, Middle East, Africa While the threat of post-budget fiscal turmoil in markets appears to have subsided, the Bank of England is likely to identify other financial stability dangers when it releases its latest risk assessment on Tuesday, accompanied by a press conference with Governor Andrew Bailey. With several global peers having released their own analyses in the past month, risks ranging from a stock bubble to parallels with the subprime debt crisis might come up. Little more than a month ago, Bailey warned of “alarm bells” in private credit. In Switzerland, a second monthly reading of inflation barely above zero may arrive on Thursday, keeping pressure on the central bank there. The following day, Sweden’s measure of consumer-price growth targeted by officials is seen weakening drastically, to a six-month low. Aside from inflation, the neighboring euro-zone will see national data pointing to the state of manufacturing at the start of the fourth quarter. German factory orders, along with French and Spanish industrial production, will come out on Friday. In Ukraine — the scene of government upheaval after the exit of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff — parliament will debate the draft of the 2026 budget on Tuesday amid demands from the International Monetary Fund. In Poland the following day, the central bank will decide whether to continue with rate cuts after a series of reductions spurred by lower-than-expected inflation. A majority of economists predict it will do so. Data in South Africa on Tuesday will likely show economic growth slowed slightly in the third quarter, to 0.5% from 0.8%, as the US’s 30% tariff on some exports weighed on manufacturing. Saudi Arabia is set to announce its 2026 budget the same day, followed by a press conference with Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan. And the next day in Turkey, data will probably show inflation eased in November to about 31.6%. Central bank Governor Fatih Karahan has said he expects an improvement, fueling expectations for a larger rate cut in December. - For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for EMEA Latin America It was a nice run, but new data may well show that Brazil’s 16-quarter expansion — the longest growth streak for LatAm’s No. 1 economy in the last three decades — ran out of road in the third quarter. The immediate causes can be boiled down to the central bank’s uncompromising monetary policy and the hit from Trump’s tariffs. A few analysts see the risk of a shallow second-half recession. A host of reports from Mexico are likely to underscore the widening output gap and loss of momentum in LatAm’s No. 2 economy. Manufacturing, consumer confidence, private consumption, and jobs added are all telling the same story, though perhaps none quite so dramatically as investment. As with Brazil, Trump’s “America First” trade and tariff policies are worsening an already challenging situation. The big Andean inflation-targeting economies lead off November’s price reports from the region. Chile, which also posts GDP-proxy figures, may report a slight cooling in consumer prices that might put a quarter-point rate cut on the table for central bankers who meet on Dec. 16. In Peru’s megacity capital of Lima, consumer prices may have ticked slightly lower from the current below-target 1.35% — while Colombia could see a hint of deceleration in the year-on-year reading from October’s 5.51%. - For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for Latin America —With assistance from Swati Pandey, Laura Dhillon Kane, Vince Golle, Monique Vanek, Robert Jameson, Mark Evans, Beril Akman and Andrew Langley.

(TSX: ERO, NYSE: ERO) (“Ero” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce its operating and financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Management will host a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, November 5, 2025, at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time to discuss the results. Dial-in details for the call can be found near the end of this press release. HIGHLIGHTS - Consolidated copper production grew to a record 16,664 tonnes in concentrate at a blended C1 cash cost(1) of $2.00 per pound in Q3 2025, reflecting higher quarter-on-quarter production at Tucumã and consistent quarterly production at Caraíba. - The Caraíba Operations produced 9,085 tonnes of copper in concentrate at an average C1 cash cost(*) of $2.32 per pound. - The Tucumã Operation produced 7,579 tonnes of copper in concentrate, representing a quarter-on-quarter increase of 19%, at an average C1 cash cost(*) of $1.62 per pound. - Quarterly gold production totaled 9,073 ounces, an increase of 17% compared to the prior period, at an average C1 cash cost(*) and All-in Sustaining Cost (“AISC”)(*) of $1,086 and $2,425 per ounce, respectively. - Quarterly financial performance reflected higher copper concentrate sales at the Tucumã Operation and strengthening copper and gold prices toward the end of the quarter as well as higher operating expenses at Tucumã following the declaration of commercial production on July 1, 2025. - Net income attributable to the owners of the Company for the quarter was $36.0 million ($0.35 per share on a diluted basis). - Adjusted net income attributable to the owners of the Company(1) for the quarter was $27.9 million ($0.27 per share on a diluted basis). - Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $77.1 million. - At quarter-end, available liquidity(1) was $111.3 million, including $66.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $45.0 million of undrawn availability under the Company’s senior secured revolving credit facility (“Senior Credit Facility”). - At Xavantina, the Company launched a value-creation initiative in 2024 aimed at capturing value from stockpiled gold concentrates produced in small but high-grade quantities since processing operations began in 2012. During Q3 2025, these efforts culminated in an initial sales agreement, with shipments commencing in October. The Company expects to sell between 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes at an approximate gold grade of 30 to 40 grams per tonne during Q4 2025, and to complete sampling, shipments, and sales of the remaining volume over the next 12 to 18 months, which is expected to significantly bolster gold sales from the Xavantina Operations. - The sales contract for expected 2025 gold concentrate volumes has a net payability, prior to streaming adjustments and after deductions, treatment and refining charges, ranging between 90% and 95% of the prevailing gold price based on the final concentrate grade, port of destination, and the prevailing gold price at the time of sale. - Operating costs for excavating, drying, loading, transportation and seaborne freight are expected to be approximately $300 to $500 per ounce. - Subsequent to quarter-end, the Company published an updated mineral reserve and resource estimate for the Xavantina Operations, which includes a maiden inferred mineral resource estimate for the gold concentrates. The maiden inferred resource estimate contains approximately 29,000 ounces of gold in high-grade, marketable concentrates and is based on sampling of approximately 20% of the total available volume of approximately 60,000 cubic meters. Sampling of the remaining concentrate volume is ongoing. - The Company is reaffirming full-year production and capital expenditure guidance for all assets, as well as full-year cost guidance for Caraíba and Xavantina, while increasing cost guidance for the Tucumã Operation to reflect higher-than-expected maintenance and freight costs. The Company continues to expect Q4 2025 to be the strongest production quarter of the year across its operations. - During Q3 2025, the Company received full assay results for the 28,000-meter Phase 1 drill program at the Furnas Copper-Gold Project (“Furnas” or the “Project”), completed in July. Results from the program continue to demonstrate high-grade continuity throughout the deposit and significantly extend the known limits of mineralization within the high-grade zones (greater than 1% CuEq(2)) to depth. - Step-out drilling during Phase 1 extended the known limits of mineralization to approximately 950 meters down-dip from surface, representing a significant increase relative to the Project’s National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) compliant mineral resource estimate, which is based on an average historical depth of drilling of 300 meters (vertical), with a maximum localized down-dip depth from surface of 580 meters. Phase 1 assay results, will support a preliminary economic assessment on the Project, including an updated NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate, which the Company plans to publish in H1 2026. - Subsequent to quarter-end, the Company completed the 17,000-metre Phase 2 drill program at Furnas. The Phase 2 program was completed approximately three months ahead of schedule, and the Company has commenced the Phase 3 drill program with 8 drill rigs currently operating on site. “We are pleased with the continued progress across our operations, where the effort and investment we’ve made in optimization initiatives are driving sequential copper and gold production growth in the second half of 2025,” said Makko DeFilippo, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Highlights include the transition from manual to mechanized mining at Xavantina that provides us with the opportunity to enhance our health and safety efforts at the mine while also increasing our development and exploration opportunities, the continued ramp-up at Tucumã, and encouraging results from Phase 1 and early completion of the Phase 2 drill program at Furnas. While Q3 represented another record consolidated copper production quarter, we are excited for how all of our operations are aligned heading into Q4, which we expect to be our strongest operating quarter of the year.” “We also announced a maiden inferred resource of gold concentrates at Xavantina, an important milestone from an initiative launched late last year to capture value from high-grade gold concentrates produced in small quantities and stockpiled at site over the past decade. This maiden inferred mineral resource estimate, which we published earlier today, was based on drilling and sampling of only a portion of the gold concentrate volumes. With further sampling underway to quantify the tonnage and grades of the remaining concentrate volume, we are excited for the potential opportunity this gold concentrate material represents.” THIRD QUARTER REVIEW The Caraíba Operations - Quarterly copper production totaled 9,085 tonnes of copper in concentrate, with an average C1 cash cost(*) of $2.32 per pound. - Plant throughput increased 26% compared to Q2 2025, reaching record volumes of nearly 1.0 million tonnes for the period, supported by higher mining rates across all three mines and a successful multi-quarter mill debottlenecking program that enabled increased processing rates. - Higher tonnes mined and processed during the period were offset by lower planned grades at both Vermelhos and Pilar. Consequently, C1 cash costs(1) increased 12% quarter-on-quarter. The Tucumã Operation - The Tucumã Operation produced 7,579 tonnes of copper in concentrate at an average C1 cash cost(1) of $1.62 per pound during the quarter. - The quarter-on-quarter increase in production of 19% was driven by higher plant throughput as processing performance continued to improve through the period, partially offset by lower planned grades. Mining operations continued to perform well with over 1.3 million tonnes of ore mined during the period. The Xavantina Operations - Quarterly gold production totaled 9,073 ounces of gold, at C1 cash cost(*) and AISC(*) of $1,086 and $2,425, respectively, per ounce. - The 17% quarter-on-quarter increase in production reflects higher throughput and processed grades as the transition to mechanized mining advanced in several key production areas of Santo Antônio. This resulted in more than 50,000 tonnes of ore mined during the quarter, a mine production rate last achieved in Q2 2022.

Production in Q4 2025 is expected to improve due to increased plant throughput at both the Caraíba and Tucumã Operations, with Tucumã also expected to benefit from mine sequencing in higher grade blocks of the open pit. At the Caraíba Operations, C1 cash costs(1) are expected to be in the lower half of the guidance range of $2.15 to $2.35 per pound of copper produced, while at Tucumã, C1 cash costs(1) are now expected to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.55 per pound (from $1.10 to $1.30 per pound previously), reflecting higher-than-expected maintenance and freight costs experienced in Q3 2025. At the Xavantina Operations, gold production is expected to be toward the lower end of the 40,000 to 50,000-ounce guidance range, with production projected to be highest in Q4 2025 due to higher mined and processed tonnage following the transition to mechanized mining. Full-year C1 cash cost(1) guidance of $850 to $1,000 per ounce of gold produced and AISC(1) guidance of $1,800 to $2,000 per ounce are maintained. In addition, the Company also expects to sell 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes of gold concentrate at an approximate gold grade of 30 to 40 grams per tonne during Q4 2025. | Previous Guidance | Current Guidance | ||| | Copper Production (tonnes) | |||| | Caraíba Operations | 37,500 – 42,500 | 37,500 – 42,500 | || | Tucumã Operation | 30,000 – 37,500 | 30,000 – 37,500 | || | Total Copper | 67,500 – 80,000 | 67,500 – 80,000 | || | Copper C1 Cash Cost(1)Guidance | |||| | Caraíba Operations | $2.15 – $2.35 | $2.15 – $2.35 | || | Tucumã Operation | $1.10 – $1.30 | $1.35 – $1.55 | || | The Xavantina Operations | |||| | Au Production (ounces) | 40,000 – 50,000 | 40,000 – 50,000 | || | Gold C1 Cash Cost(1)Guidance | $850 – $1,000 | $850 – $1,000 | || | Gold AISC(1)Guidance | $1,800 – $2,000 | $1,800 – $2,000 | | Note: | Guidance is based on estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, mineral reserve estimates, grade and continuity of interpreted geological formations and metallurgical recovery performance.

"- In today’s CEO Daily: Diane Brady reports on F1’s impressive rise from the Las Vegas Grand Prix. - The big story: Hope builds for a Ukraine peace plan. - The markets: Up in the U.S. and Europe; down in Asia. - Plus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune. Good morning. If F1 has suddenly appeared on your radar over the past few years, it’s due to a few factors: Liberty Media, team CEOs like McLaren Racing’s Zak Brown, consumer shifts, and the increasing role that sports play in corporate marketing. Liberty Media acquired Formula 1 racing from a consortium of investors in 2017 at a valuation of $8 billion and has since tripled that value through partnering to create U.S. races, Netflix’s Formula 1: Drive to Survive series, an F1 movie, the F1 Academy woman’s circuit, fashion, influencer marketing and broadcast reach that will further expand with an Apple partnership next year. “We were a very exclusive sport, ‘look, don’t touch,’ and Liberty brought a new way of thinking,” Brown said in the latest Fortune Leadership Next podcast. “We figured out how to let people in the tent to engage with the sport”—be it the drivers, the team, the technology, the drama off the grid or the idiosyncrasies of the sport itself. At the Formula 1 Heineken Las Vegas Grand Prix this weekend, I saw evidence of both the democratization of the sport and the move to a two-tiered experience economy in which brands tailor special packages for the top. LVMH is now F1’s global luxury partner and many individuals I met had flown in from across the world and paid thousands of dollars to see the race from the Paddock Club and suites like House 44, F1’s collaboration with Ferrari driver Lewis Hamilton and Soho House. High-end American Express cardholders could sample “The Only Caviar” with co-founders Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul and Michelin-star chef Diego Sabino at the Aria resort. At the same time, more mainstream consumer brands are also backing F1, like PepsiCo, LEGO, Disney, and Hello Kitty. The 10-team sport generated more than $2 billion in direct sponsorships last year and is accelerating in value; top F1 teams are worth more than most NBA franchises and European soccer clubs. Exhibit A: Mercedes team principal and part-owner Toto Wolff’s deal last week to sell a 15% stake to CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, which values the team at $6 billion. McLaren, meanwhile, has gone from facing insolvency five years ago to making a profit of $61 million last year, with more to come, thanks to a new sponsorship deal with Mastercard that will reportedly bring in around $100 million a year. But the ultimate measure of performance is still on the track. McLaren saw drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri get disqualified after placing second and fourth in the Vegas Grand Prix because officials found both cars had technical infringements. That’s heartbreaking for McLaren and makes for good TV in a season in which Brown’s team has already secured the top place but individual drivers are still battling for first. As Brown put it on the podcast: “We’re in the sports and entertainment business.” Click here to listen to the podcast on Apple or Spotify. Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Top news Ukraine peace deal Ukrainian and American officials say they’ve made positive progress on a U.S.-drafted deal to end Russia’s invasion after many Ukrainians initially claimed the accord was too favorable for the Kremlin. President Donald Trump imposed a deadline of Thursday for the deal and lashed out at Ukraine as talks progressed, falsely accusing it of being ungrateful for American support. White collar unemployment Americans with four-year university degrees now make up a quarter of the unemployed, a record, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. College grads’ unemployment rate of 2.8% in September—up half a percentage point from a year ago—reflects the recent slowdown in white collar hiring. Tariff backup plan The White House is reportedly drafting backup plans should the U.S. Supreme Court strike down President Donald Trump’s tariffs on the basis that he doesn’t have the power to impose them unilaterally. The alternative avenues for enacting levies will likely be slower or more limited in scope. Tariff risks fade Meanwhile, on earnings calls, executives are talking less about tariffs risks than they were earlier this year as the levies’ true fallout takes hold. A WSJ analysis of 5,000 earnings calls found that of calls that mentioned tariffs, about 20% mentioned associated risks in November, down from a high of roughly 55% in mid-June. Britain’s new media giant The owner of The Daily Mail will buy rival newspaper The Telegraph in a £500 million deal that will create a new right-leaning media giant in the U.K. as the populist conservative Reform Party gains popularity as a counter to the ruling Labour Party. Shein’s first store Shein’s first physical location in Paris is rattling lawmakers and fellow retailers who say the Chinese ecommerce giant’s ultra low prices pose an existential threat to traditional department stores. Pershing Square to go public Bill Ackman is preparing to take his hedge fund management company Pershing Square public along with a new closed-end investment fund, Pershing Square USA. Both could launch as early as the first quarter of 2026 if market conditions permit. Stargate AI project accused of being an antitrust violation OpenAI, Nvidia, and other tech companies have joined forces in the Stargate Project, a massive $500 billion undertaking to build advanced AI infrastructure in the U.S., with backing from the federal government. Although the collaboration is praised for bolstering national AI capabilities, a Yale legal expert warns it may violate antitrust laws by allowing major rivals to coordinate closely in ways that could reduce competition, increase prices, and stifle innovation in the tech industry.

"- In today’s CEO Daily: Diane Brady on Satya Nadella’s smaller public role. - The big story: S&P 500 decline looks set to continue. - The markets: In the red, with sharp drops in Asia. - Plus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune. Good morning.Microsoft Ignite, the tech giant’s annual developer and IT conference, will kick off this morning in San Francisco. For the first time since he brought together Microsoft’s disparate tech events under one banner as a rookie CEO a decade ago, Satya Nadella will not deliver the opening keynote. Instead, that role will go to Judson Althoff, who leads Microsoft’s commercial business. That’s a shame as we need to be hearing more from CEOs like Nadella right now, especially given his stature in a time of mounting public mistrust of both tech leaders and AI. Nadella announced last month that he’s taking a more internal focus, handing off some of his responsibilities to Althoff to focus on the company’s “highest-ambition technical work.” I bet a lot of his peers would love to do that: With the exceptions like Marc Benioff and John Chambers, many tech leaders I’ve met don’t relish the public-facing part of their jobs. Nadella did recently post a short essay on LinkedIn, laying out his vision for AI platforms to create a “positive-sum” future in which companies can “build their own AI native capabilities and enterprise value” versus what he calls “zero-sum thinking and the winner-take-all hype.” That’s an important message from the leader of a company that has a complicated history when it comes to creating tech ecosystems that sometimes lock in users and lock out competition. It’s a message that would get a lot more attention if he said it on stage this morning when the spotlight will be on Microsoft. Every CEO has three basic roles: to create the vision and strategy of their company, to build the leadership team to execute on that vision and strategy, and to create the conditions to successfully replace themselves. Transcending all that is a CEO’s responsibility to be communicator-in-chief, the face of the company, the one who breaks big news and answers questions from investors, customers, regulators and journalists, among others. With all the talk of AI bubbles, mass layoffs, business transformation and more, it’s even more important to hear from CEOs. It matters when Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar talks about hiring liberal arts graduates or when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg writes about developing superintelligence. That doesn’t mean we have to believe everything they say: my colleague Shawn Tully has a piece out today about the potential disconnect between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s rhetoric and reality. Althoff will no doubt do a credible job at the keynote and I look forward to hearing what he has to say. But in a company that’s shaping the AI revolution, we should also be hearing from the person at the top.

Epstein ties to Summers and Hoffman Former Treasury Secretary and ex-Harvard President Larry Summers says he’s “deeply ashamed” of his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. He will step back from public commitments but continue to teach economics at Harvard. The latest tranche of Epstein emails included friendly communication between Summers and the late pedophile after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution. The new Epstein emails have also ensnared LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Trump puts mid-2026 date on tariff dividend checks President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday that $2,000 “tariff dividend” checks would be sent to Americans in the middle of 2026, per Axios. The checks would go to “individuals of moderate income, middle income,” Trump said, though the mathematics behind the checks—and whether the President would need legislation behind it—remain unclear. Goldman Sachs dismisses an AI bubble A new note from Goldman Sachs published on Monday suggests that the U.S. equity market has already priced in much of the long-term value that AI will bring. The analysis suggests that valuations are not at “bubble levels” but are “well ahead of the macro impact.” Fossil fuels are back Energy giants in Europe are returning to the once-shunned business of fossil fuels, abandoning their one-time role as leaders in renewable energy and providing another proof point that signatories are unlikely to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord.

"Price vs. patriotism: Holiday season a test for buy Canadian sentiment TORONTO — When customers visited Lisa Pozin’s two Vancouver gift shops earlier this year, they had buy Canadian on the brain. “It was the first thing on their mind. They would comment on it and it was like they were seeing the red everywhere,” the owner of Giving Gifts recalled of a surge in patriotic shopping that a tariff war with the U.S. sparked in the winter. “They were looking for the maple leaves … and they were reading packages, even for things like soap, to make sure it was made in Canada.” These days, Pozin said shoppers still appreciate domestic items on her shelves, but their country of origin doesn’t carry the same weight it once did. In fact, many of her customers no longer turn over packages to see where something was made. Her observations suggest that as the tariff war drags on, consumers are growing numb to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tit-for-tat and with the cost of living continuing to rise, some are willing to prioritize price and convenience over patriotism. This holiday season will test how much of a regression the buy Canadian movement has seen as best intentions and budgets go head-to-head. Before most Canadians even started buying gifts, research shows they were keen on supporting homegrown brands. The Business Development Bank of Canada predicted almost 60 per cent of the average $943 Canadians will spend on holiday shopping will be dedicated to domestic products and services this year. Meanwhile, Deloitte Canada said 73 per cent of the 1,000 people it surveyed between Aug. 27 and Sept. 5 prefer to purchase products that support local or Canadian-owned businesses and 56 per cent want to buy gifts that support neighbourhood or small businesses. However, the interest doesn’t always convert to sales, said Chelsee Pettit, who runs Aaniin Retail Inc., a business selling Indigenous goods online and at Toronto’s Eaton Centre. “Some people, they just don’t do it, but they’ll talk about it,” she said. Spending data in the run-up to the holidays backs up what she’s seen. Statistics Canada’s fourth-quarter business survey found that between April 1 and Nov. 5, about 13 per cent of companies experienced an increase in sales for Canadian products. But over the same span, many more businesses — a whopping 68.2 per cent of them — did not experience an increase in sales of Canadian products and 18.5 per cent were unsure whether there had been impact at all. The shift is also borne out in anecdotes from retailers. Last month, Loblaw Companies Ltd. revealed many of its customers had switched back to buying U.S. products after Canadian countertariffs on U.S. imports were removed. Marty Weintraub, national retail leader at Deloitte Canada, calls what many businesses are now experiencing the “say-do gap.” “Somebody says something, in terms of what they want to do, but then when push comes to shove and they’re sitting in front of the cash register, they do something else,” he said. Weintraub figures this happens because some consumers are facing so much financial pressure, they feel they have to put price before patriotism “Value almost trumps everything else, probably eight times out of 10, unless there’s a particular reason somebody wants to pay a premium,” he said. And it’s not just cost that can dissuade someone from shopping Canadian. If an option made outside the country is closer to a customer’s home or easier to order, they often don’t think twice. “Convenience outweighs anything — and delivery,” Pozin said. Brands matter, too, said Sam Care, owner of Toronto toy shop Playful Minds. Fickle kids sometimes won’t settle for anything other than the item they have their hearts set on and loved ones will indulge them even if it means sending money out of the country. “There are Legos coming from Mexico, but we definitely get it from the United States, and not one person has ever said anything about that,” Care said. “They just keep buying and Lego is one of our top items.” Like Pozin, she said customers aren’t looking for Canadian-made items with the same gusto they once were but they still consider shopping at Playful Minds a win because it’s a local, independent business. “They don’t care as long as small businesses are succeeding,” she said.

"Pressure on the rupee is mounting as India's trade deficit widens, and portfolio investment outflow remains elevated. The market is seeking cues from the Indo-US trade deal that could impact demand for dollars on both the current and capital accounts. RBI, according to established policy, is intervening to stabilise the exchange rate rather than to defend any specific level for the rupee. The currency has lost 4.5% this year, and is expected to keep flirting with â¹90 to a dollar on month-end import demand. The dollar is strengthening on expectations of a rate cut by Fed next month. A higher frequency of RBI intervention in the forwards market is constrained by its need to replenish forex reserves. A resolution of the tariff issue with the US will provide policy support to the rupee. Even a limited trade deal and a rollback of penal tariffs over the purchase of Russian crude will add to India's strong growth momentum. Tax stimulus for domestic consumption is offsetting the drag on exports to the US, India's biggest trading partner, and the energy market has headroom for India to switch its fuel supplies. Expectations of a breakthrough in trade talks are keeping markets on edge despite headline indices being close to their lifetime highs, and despite indications that growth during the quarter will sprint along as it did in the previous three months. RBI is set for a meeting to review rates early next month. Growth and inflation are on course to meet the central bank's full-year projections. There is scope to cut rates, but core inflation remains elevated. The rate-setting decision will also impact the exchange rate, although Sanjay Malhotra has flagged the Indo-US trade deal as the signal for dollar demand.

"Ten months into his second term, President Donald Trump is being challenged by the very base he prides himself on creating, and he finds himself besieged by an army of issues that could threaten his MAGA support and spell trouble for lawmakers who remain by his side. Reeling over the farmer furor that has met his plan to import Argentine beef, and now from Democratic victories in last week's off-cycle elections, Trump is facing friendly fire over perceived pivots on immigration, the state of the economy and the latest episode of the long-running Epstein saga that has dogged his second administration's every step. Many of these tensions came to a head in an interview with Laura Ingraham that aired on Monday, during which the Fox News host challenged the president on offering 600,000 visas to Chinese students and his unexpected praise for the H-1B visa program, characterizing these as decidedly anti-MAGA stances. Trump's defense—that China is no worse an adversary than France, and that foreign-born workers are needed to account for the U.S.'s lack of talent—seems to have sparked as much backlash as the positions themselves, though the White House says Trump's core commitments remain unchanged. ""In record time, President Trump has done more than any president in modern history to tighten our immigration laws and put American workers first,"" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Newsweek, referencing the $100,000 fee attached to new H-1B applications and the Department of Labor's crackdown on abuse within the program. The president himself was quick to reject the idea of a divide developing within the MAGA camp over any of these issues. ""Don't forget: MAGA was my idea. MAGA was nobody else's idea,"" he said on The Ingraham Angle. ""I know what MAGA wants better than anyone else, and MAGA wants to see our country thrive."" A 'Presidency in Trouble' ""I think the MAGA base is splitting,"" said Peter Loge, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. ""Donald Trump will never lose his core support, but what it means to be MAGA or a true Republican is now suddenly being debated."" Loge, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told Newsweek that the combination of snafus embroiling the administration, rather than any one issue specifically, seems to indicate Trump might be losing his footing. ""We connect the dots to make pictures, and the recent dots include Epstein, the election, the court being very skeptical of Trump's tariff policies, increasing economic insecurity, falling poll numbers,"" he said. ""These bits of information, these dots, paint a picture of a presidency in trouble."" Todd Belt, a professor of political management at George Washington University, said evidence for fracturing in the president's base included the town hall meetings at which GOP lawmakers have been confronted over their support for the president. Further evidence were the lawmakers and media figures—the MAGA ""elite""—who appear increasingly comfortable breaking with Trump on key issues. Belt noted additional issues that had eroded the perception of an unflappable MAGA support for the president, including growing discontent with the U.S.'s support for Israel and Trump's ""flip on Ukraine"" that angered MAGA's isolationist wing. He added, the ""really big one is Epstein."" The Justice Department's reluctance to release all documents related to the late convicted sex offender, and new details regarding Trump’s relationship to Epstein, have left the president, once the populist outsider, accused of becoming the very establishment he sought to overthrow. ""I think MAGA, in terms of the movement, is willing to forgive Donald Trump on a lot of things because they consider him to be the businessman, and he knows what he's doing when he's going back and forth with his tariffs and disruptive sort of behavior,"" Belt said. ""But this is the one where it just really violates the ideology of, you know, deep state cover-ups and being an outsider—all the things that he promised and now seems to be on the other side of."" Though lawmakers in the lower chamber secured enough signatures to force a House vote on releasing the Epstein files, Belt believed the bill would fail to pass the Senate and avoid the explosive prospect of a Trump veto, adding that the issue itself was one that would remain a persistent thorn in the side of Trump's presidency. Trump's Affordability Crisis This latest flare-up in the Epstein saga adds to the woes Trump already faces over the economy—with polls finding that his approval on key issues, such as inflation, continues to erode even among Republicans. Political scientist Sheri Berman argues that the one-two punch of Epstein and affordability—an issue many now agree has had political consequences for the GOP—has created a threat to Trump's presidency unlike any seen before, rattling both the hard-liners for whom the Epstein saga is central and the collection of ""potentially switchable"" voters who will consider rising costs when casting votes in 2026 and beyond. ""Either one of those things alone is something to manage, but the combination of discontent with the hardcore hard right and fears that these broad affordability issues might be causing people who might waver between voting Republican and Democrat to vote for Democrat,"" she told Newsweek, ""that is a somewhat different situation than Trump has faced in the past."" Alongside criticizing his apparent defectors—telling reporters that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has ""lost her way""—Trump's strategy has been to take a page from the book of his long-serving political confidant Roger Stone and deny outright that there is any issue to contend with. The president has repeatedly claimed that grocery prices ""are way down,"" contradicting the kitchen-table realities of most Americans, while declaring both affordability and uproar over Epstein are hoaxes created by his rivals. ""You can't out-message the economy,"" Belt said. ""What people are feeling and what they're seeing in their finances, you can never out-message that in terms of saying it's a hoax."" Democratic strategist Doug Gordon believed Trump's conundrum was one he himself could overcome, at least with the diehards over whom he still holds an ""iron grip."" But Gordon told Newsweek that proximity to the president could come back to bite Republicans who have till now been able to rely on it for political lift. ""The problem for Republicans—which was once again made apparent in the recent elections—is that MAGA is a cult of personality,"" he said. ""And when Trump isn't on the ballot, the MAGA base either splinters or stays home."" Loge called the 2026 midterms a ""proxy for Donald Trump and Donald Trump's policies,"" one that will force Republicans to decide whether to upset the commander in chief or their constituents. ""Republicans are going to be in the position of having to either continue to defend an unpopular president and unpopular policies and risk losing the general election,"" he said, ""or attacking an unpopular president and unpopular policies and risk getting attacked by that president during the election."" MAGA remains Trump's creation, and its most faithful will likely remain by his side through this perilous chapter of his presidency, but members of the broader Republican Party may soon discover the costs of devotion as they barrel toward a midterm reckoning.",right
"President Donald Trump said Wednesday he would “love to fire” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he has long criticized for what he sees as a failure to cut interest rates fast enough. Trump blasted Powell, without mentioning his name, at the U.S.-Saudi Arabia Investment Forum in Washington on Wednesday, telling Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that Powell “needs to work on” him. “Mortgage rates are down despite the Fed. I mean, Scott, you got to work on this guy. He’s got some real mental problems. No, he has something wrong with him,” Trump said. “I’ll be honest, I’d love to fire his ass. He should be fired. Guy’s grossly incompetent,” he added. The Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter percent or 25 basis points in September and October, after months of pressure from Trump, who nicknamed Powell “Too Late” earlier this year. As Breitbart News Economics Editor John Carney noted, the Federal Reserve was misled by its fear of the Trump tariffs, citing a historical study from the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank: A typical large tariff hike—roughly a four percentage-point rise in the average tariff rate—shows up in the pre-World War II historical record as associated with about two percentage points less inflation and one percentage point more unemployment. The authors of the paper admit that they do not know exactly how this works but note that it is akin to what you would expect from a decline in demand. That is the opposite of what the Federal Reserve told itself about tariffs in 2025. To understand how consequential this misreading is, start with a simple principle: when policymakers get the sign of an economic shock wrong, when they mistake its direction, they naturally respond in the wrong direction too. Trump also blasted Powell for cost overruns at the Fed, as he did when he was on Powell’s turf touring construction over the summer. He said Wednesday Powell should be sued for the overruns. Trump said in July that the project, which initially had an estimated price tag of $1.9 billion in 2021 according to Fortune, ballooned to $3.1 billion, and on Wednesday, he put the cost at $4 billion. “I’m building a ballroom that’s going to cost a tiny fraction of that, and it’s bigger than the whole thing put together,” he added.

"Bhadoo added that instructions for the remaining components of the mission will be finalised by 15 January, ensuring that all frameworks are in place before the next financial year begins. What the Interest Equalisation Scheme offer The Interest Equalisation Scheme provides exporters with an interest subsidy on pre- and post-shipment credit, helping them borrow at more affordable rates.The Market Access Initiative, on the other hand, supports exporters looking to enter new markets or expand their share in existing ones by offering assistance for promotional activities, market research, trade fairs and more. Why the Export Promotion Mission matters Approved on 12 November, the Export Promotion Mission carries an outlay of Rs 25,060 crore spread across six years starting 2025–26. It has been designed largely to help exporters cope with steep tariff hikes imposed by the United States.The mission will be driven through two sub-schemes: - Niryat Protsahan (Rs 10,401 crore) - Niryat Disha (Rs 14,659 crore) Sectors under pressure Textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, engineering goods and marine products are among the worst affected sectors after the US raised import duties to 50 per cent from 27 August. These high tariffs have weighed heavily on India’s shipment volumes to its largest export market.In October, India’s merchandise exports to the US fell 8.58 per cent to USD 6.3 billion. Overall exports contracted 11.8 per cent to USD 34.38 billion, while the trade deficit touched a record USD 41.68 billion, fuelled partly by a surge in gold imports. Despite the October dip, India’s exports for April–October grew 0.63 per cent to USD 254.25 billion. Imports during the same period rose 6.37 per cent to USD 451.08 billion. Meanwhile, India and the US are in discussions over a possible bilateral trade agreement, which could ease tariff pressures in the future. Inputs from PTI",right

"India’s Q2 GDP growth, which accelerated to a six-quarter high of 8.2% was lifted by robust consumer spending and front-loading of production ahead of the festive season and punitive US tariffs. The faster-than-expected pace marked a significant growth from 5.6% in the same period last year and from 7.8% in the previous quarter, helping India retain the title of the world's fastest-growing major economy. The government lowered Goods and Services Tax rates on most items from September 22 and implemented labour reforms in the last three months as it tries to keep the domestic economy strong in the face of global uncertainties. ALSO READ: India Q2 GDP growth quickens on year to 8.2%, a six-quarter high even before full impact of GST cut kicks in Economists said stockpiling for the festive season as well as expedited exports ahead of the 50% tariff deadline on August 27 might have contributed to the quarterly growth figures. Private consumption, which accounts for almost 60% of GDP, jumped 7.9% last quarter from a year ago. The manufacturing sector grew 9.1%. Some economists also said the data may have been boosted by statistical effects such as a lower deflator, used to strip out inflation from economic output. The government expects strong demand, firm public spending and easing inflation to help India weather trade uncertainties and sustain growth through the rest of the 2025-26 financial year. Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran has expressed optimism that India's economic growth will exceed 7% this fiscal and the size of the GDP will cross the USD 4 trillion mark. While the numbers will be a major boost for the government, many economists do not expect the momentum to last through the remaining quarters if uncertainty over a trade deal with the US lingers. India, which faces a 50% tariff rate, is among the last major economies yet to sign a trade agreement with Washington. The International Monetary Fund has lowered its projection for India’s growth next financial year to 6.2% on the assumption that high US tariffs will remain in place. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India has revised its GDP growth forecast for FY2025–26 upwards to 6.8%, against the earlier estimate of 6.5%. Q2FY26 GDP growth forecast was increased to 7% from 6.7%, Q3 growth target was lowered to 6.4% from 6.6%, and Q4 was also revised to 6.2% from 6.3%. The Indian GDP is expected to grow 6.5% in the 2024-2025 fiscal year ending March 2025. As the government gears up for Budget '26, existing policies in taxation, investment incentives, and welfare programs will play a critical role. The principle of continuity and strategic realignment is likely to guide budgetary decisions, ensuring a seamless transition while addressing evolving economic demands. With a coalition government in place, the budget will need to balance growth objectives with coalition partners' priorities, aiming to maintain economic stability and foster development. This budget is expected to be a pivotal document, shaping India’s economic future amid a dynamic political landscape.",right
"Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN) on Tuesday chided Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) for “sneering” at Kentucky Senate Republican candidate Nate Morris for touting his working class and union background. During a Kentucky industry forum on October 29, Barr attacked Morris for talking about how he comes from a working-class union background. “There are some candidates that say they come from a union background or union family. I’m very proud to say that I’m an annual supporter of the Employee Rights Act,” Barr said. Barr’s message did not sit well with Banks, who hails from a union factory worker background, as he described in his maiden speech touting Trump’s America First Trade policies. The Hoosier senator wrote: As the son of a union factory worker and having grown up in a working-class family myself, we should be celebrating the fact that President Trump transformed the GOP from being the party of the country club, to being the party of the American worker. Sneering at people for being proud of their working-class upbringing sends the exact wrong message. Morris responded, proudly backing how President Donald Trump has moved to increase the Republican tent by including union workers. “I’m not going to apologize for growing up in a working-class family and I think it’s a good thing that President Trump has transformed the GOP into the party of the American worker,” Morris said. I saw with my own eyes what happens to workers and their families when politicians in both parties ship their jobs overseas and allow unfettered immigration into our country to drive down their wages. When the wages stagnated and the jobs got shipped overseas, the fentanyl came into communities like mine and families were torn apart.…My opponent, Andy Barr was a man born to the manner on third base. He started out in life in one of America’s most exclusive country clubs rearing him loyalty to the American ruling class. He never struggled financially. He never knew what it was like to scrap and claw to survive. He never saw the pain caused by career politicians gutting the American working-class. He never created a single job in his life. He was handed everything he has on a silver platter.He sneers at working-class union men and women because he has nothing in common with them. It’s the same reason why he smears those of us opposed to amnesty as “nativists” because he doesn’t understand the pain caused by the pro-amnesty policies that him and his politician buddies supported for decades. Morris added, “But just like his “mentor” Mitch McConnell, Andy Barr wants to reverse that and take us back to being the party of country club elites…and I will always fight to never let that happen.” Morris has backed Trump’s tariff policies, while Barr has criticized the president’s tariff policies, saying that the ideal tariff level is “zero.” Other MAGA supporters attacked Barr’s comments.

"President Donald Trump’s administration is working behind the scenes on fallback options if the Supreme Court strikes down one of his major tariff authorities, looking to replace the levies as quickly as possible. Both the Commerce Department and the Office of the US Trade Representative have studied Plan B options if the court rules against the administration, according to US officials familiar with the planning. Those include Section 301 and Section 122 of the Trade Act, which grant the president unilateral ability to impose duties. The replacements come with risks — they tend to be either slower or more limited than the wide-ranging powers Trump has asserted so far and could face their own legal challenges. The administration is holding out hope that it will win the case outright. Trump has repeatedly urged the justices to uphold his country-based tariffs, which he imposed by citing an economic emergency. Still, the preparations are the latest signal the administration is bracing for a potential unfavorable outcome, after the court appeared skeptical of Trump’s global tariffs during this month’s oral arguments. They also show Trump’s commitment to imposing tariffs, including through untested means. One administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that tariffs will remain a core part of Trump’s economic agenda regardless of the court’s decision. “We’re waiting for a decision. We hope it’s going to be good, but if it’s not, we’ll do — we always find ways, you know, we find ways,” Trump said Wednesday. The White House declined to comment on the specifics of its preparations but acknowledged it’s seeking “new ways” to maintain Trump’s trade policy. “President Trump lawfully exercised the emergency tariff powers granted to the Executive Branch by Congress, and the Administration is confident in ultimate victory on this matter by the Supreme Court. The Administration is always examining new ways to address America’s historic goods trade deficit and reshore the manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security,” spokesman Kush Desai said. It’s not clear when the Supreme Court will rule. The justices could uphold the tariffs, knock them down entirely or take a more targeted approach. The decision threatens to generate further uncertainty for businesses and foreign governments. “My expectation is they’ll move immediately to reinstate them,” said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, referring to Trump’s team. “They’re going to basically piece it all back together.” The Supreme Court case hinges on Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, under which he’s imposed so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on imports worldwide, as well as charges on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican goods related to fentanyl and a levy on products from Brazil in an ill-fated attempt to stop the prosecution of former president and Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro. The total effective tariff rate on US imports is about 14.4%, and more than half of that is due to IEEPA duties, according to Bloomberg Economics estimates. The economists “expect most duties to eventually be fully replaced” if the Supreme Court wipes out the country-based levies. In some cases, backup plans are already in motion. Trump has launched a 301 investigation against Brazil, for instance, and has 301 levies on some Chinese products from his first term. The provision typically requires a lengthy investigation before duties can be implemented. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has said Trump may turn to 301 or 122 powers to reimpose import taxes if the Supreme Court rules against the administration. “There are a lot of things that we could do so that we could reproduce the policies that we have right now with alternative authorities,” Hassett said during a Nov. 13 interview with Bloomberg host and Carlyle Group co-founder and co-Chairman David Rubenstein at an Economic Club of Washington event. Section 122 powers would let the president impose tariffs of 15% — a threshold he’s settled on in several deals with other nations — but only for a maximum of 150 days. Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro earlier this year cited that time limit as a reason the administration does not plan to rely heavily on that measure. Trump has also used Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to apply tariffs to sectors including metals and autos. The administration has announced new investigations and imposed fresh duties. Plus, the steady creep of completed products falling under those duties has irritated some trading partners, including those in Europe, who say it undercuts a cap on sectoral tariffs in the US-European Union trade pact. “I’m beginning to wonder whether this is part of the Administration’s Plan B should IEEPA be found unconstitutional,” former US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler posted last month on social media. “It’s only a matter of time before the 232s cover most of our manufacturing base.” Section 338 of the Tariff Act is another potential tool for Trump, but one that could be ripe for a fresh legal fight given that it has never before been used. “It would be subject to litigation, probably very quickly,” Lincicome said. “I’m cautiously optimistic that we are avoiding a return to 2025 chaos.” Still, the new measures won’t be as easy for Trump to enact, given their limitations. Officials would have to grapple with novel legal questions, such as whether the administration could impose Section 122 tariffs concurrently, cancel them before the deadline and then reimpose them under a new clock or whether to retroactively apply duties to try and avoid refunding money collected under the existing system. “It would be a huge mess,” Lincicome said. An adverse court ruling could force the administration to give back more than $88 billion in duties already collected, according to Bloomberg Economics. White House Deputy Chief of Staff James Blair said he thinks there’s a 50-50 chance, or better, of the administration winning the case. But if it doesn’t, officials would essentially restore any levies struck down. “There are tools that the president already has in existing authorities to pretty much just put it back through a different means,” Blair said at a Nov. 18 Bloomberg Government event. “We’ll see what they rule.”",right
"Construction spending picked up in August, the Census Bureau said Monday. The Census Bureau reported that construction outlays reached an annualized pace of $2.17 trillion, up 0.2 percent from July’s revised $2.165 trillion figure. The result beat economist expectations for a 0.2 percent decline. The report, delayed by the government shutdown, showed resilience in the construction sector after forecasts had anticipated a slowdown. Private-sector construction spending led the gains, expanding 0.3 percent to a $1.652 trillion annualized pace. Residential construction was the strongest performer, rising 0.8 percent to $914.8 billion annually. The increase was primarily driven by multifamily construction and home improvements, while single-family construction spending slipped 0.4 percent. The multifamily gain marks a pause in the downward trend that began in mid-2023. The overall residential showing indicates builders remain active in adding housing supply, a positive signal for affordability as new inventory comes to market. “Private residential construction spending inched up 0.8 percent in August, continuing steady growth since June 2025. This modest increase was primarily driven by more spending on multifamily construction and home improvements. However, total spending was 2 percent lower than a year ago, as the housing sector continues to navigate the economic uncertainty stemming from ongoing tariff concerns and elevated mortgage rates,” Na Zhao, a principal economist at the National Association of Homebuilders wrote in a blog post focused on the report. Nonresidential construction slipped 0.3 percent to $737.3 billion, while public construction spending held essentially flat at a $517 billion annualized pace. Educational construction rose 0.6 percent, while highway construction declined modestly by 0.2 percent. On a year-over-year basis, total construction spending remains down 1.6 percent compared to August 2024, though the monthly acceleration suggests the sector may be stabilizing after earlier weakness. The Census Bureau report represents among the first batch of catch-up statistics from federal agencies working through a backlog created during the six-week government shutdown. The bureau did not provide a timeline for releasing September construction-spending data. COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"President Donald Trump warned that the fate of the United States hangs in the balance ahead of Wednesday's hearing in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on his use of tariffs in a test of his presidential powers. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the upcoming case is ""literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our country."" The high court will consider whether Trump has the authority to impose tariffs on America’s trading partners. The Trump administration argues in legal briefs that the justices should back the president’s tariffs and overturn rulings by two lower courts that struck them down. TRUMP'S TARIFF POWER GRAB BARRELS TOWARD SUPREME COURT The court must decide whether a tariff is essentially a tax on imported goods. Trump has defended his use of tariffs as critical to national security. ""With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security,"" Trump wrote. ""Without it, we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us."" TRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER' ""Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,"" he added. ""A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them."" Trump has argued that the outcome will determine whether presidents can use tariffs freely as a tool for both economic leverage and national security. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP ""Other countries use tariffs against us, and we weren't able to openly and freely use tariffs against them,"" Trump said. ""I'll give you an example – China. That was going to be a disaster for the world, and I was able to settle it very quickly, very easily because I was able to use tariffs. It's total national security, and economic health is also part of national security, by the way.""",right
"President Donald Trump boasts that his tariffs protect American industries, lure factories to the United States, raise money for the federal government and give him diplomatic leverage. Now, he’s claiming they can finance a windfall for American families, too: He’s promising a generous tariff dividend. The president proposed the idea on his Truth Social media platform Sunday, five days after his Republican Party lost elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere largely because of voter discontent with his economic stewardship — specifically, the high cost of living. The tariffs are bringing in so much money, the president posted, that “a dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.’’ Budget experts scoffed at the idea, which conjured memories of the Trump administration’s short-lived plan for DOGE dividend checks financed by billionaire Elon Musk’s federal budget cuts. “The numbers just don’t check out,″ said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. Details are scarce, including what the income limits would be and whether payments would go to children. Even Trump’s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, sounded a bit blindsided by the audacious dividend plan. Appearing Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Bessent said he hadn’t discussed the dividend with the president and suggested that it might not mean that Americans would get a check from the government. Instead, Bessent said, the rebate might take the form of tax cuts. The tariffs are certainly raising money — $195 billion in the budget year that ended Sept. 30, up 153% from $77 billion in fiscal 2024. But they still account for less than 4% of federal revenue and have done little to dent the federal budget deficit — a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2025. Budget wonks say Trump’s dividend math doesn’t work. John Ricco, an analyst with the Budget Lab at Yale University, reckons that Trump’s tariffs will bring in $200 billion to $300 billion a year in revenue. But a $2,000 dividend — if it went to all Americans, including children — would cost $600 billion. “It’s clear that the revenue coming in would not be adequate,” he said. Ricco also noted that Trump couldn’t just pay the dividends on his own. They would require legislation from Congress. Moreover, the centerpiece of Trump’s protectionist trade policies — double-digit taxes on imports from almost every country in the world — may not survive a legal challenge that has reached the U.S. Supreme Court. In a hearing last week, the justices sounded skeptical about the Trump administration’s assertion of sweeping power to declare national emergencies to justify the tariffs. Trump has bypassed Congress, which has authority under the Constitution to levy taxes, including tariffs. If the court strikes down the tariffs, the Trump administration may be refunding money to the importers who paid them, not sending dividend checks to American families. (Trump could find other ways to impose tariffs, even if he loses at the Supreme Court; but it could be cumbersome and time-consuming.) Mainstream economists and budget analysts note that tariffs are paid by U.S. importers who then generally try to pass along the cost to their customers through higher prices. The dividend plan “misses the mark,” the Tax Foundation’s York said. ”If the goal is relief for Americans, just get rid of the tariffs.’’",right
"President Donald Trump announced a series of breakthrough reciprocal trade deals on Thursday with the U.S.-friendly Latin American countries of El Salvador, Argentina, Ecuador, and Guatemala. The deals grant streamlined access to U.S. products in those countries’ respective markets — particularly for farmers, ranchers, fishermen, small businesses, and manufacturers — in return for tariff exceptions on some imports. With El Salvador, the White House detailed that the new deal builds upon the United States’ existing trade relationship with the Central American country. As part of the deal, the administration of President Nayib Bukele will facilitate trade, addressing non-tariff barriers and streamlining regulatory requirements for U.S. exports such as pharmaceutical products and medical devices. El Salvador pledged to address barriers pertaining to U.S. agricultural products and will move forward with international intellectual property treaties to ensure that U.S. agricultural exports will not be “restricted due to the mere use of certain cheese and meat terms.” Other areas in which El Salvador agreed to improve trade with the U.S. include digital trade. As per the terms of the agreement, El Salvador will refrain from imposing digital service taxes on America. Both countries will support a permanent multilateral moratorium on custom duties on electronic transmissions. President Bukele appeared to have celebrated the deal by posting the Salvadoran flag emoji on social media. In the case of Argentina, the agreement reaffirms the alliance between President Trump and President Javier Milei. The countries agreed to open their markets to each other on key products and enact reciprocal, bilateral market access conditions for trade in beef. Argentina agreed to provide preferential market access for certain U.S. goods exports such as medicines, machinery, and a wide range of agricultural products. Argentina also committed to not require consular formalities and statistical taxes for U.S. exports. The South American country agreed to open its market to U.S. live cattle and made further commitments for U.S. poultry within one year. Much like El Salvador, Argentina agreed to facilitate digital trade with the United States, in addition to a longer list of trade-related agreements. “We have a deal with the United States,” President Milei wrote on social media, followed by the initials of his popular catchphrase “long live liberty, damn it!” The Argentine presidency said in an official statement that Milei reaffirms his commitment to continue working with President Trump to deepen economic and strategic cooperation based on the “shared values that made our countries great and that defend life, liberty, and private property above all else.” With Guatemala, the administration of President Bernardo Arévalo agreed to streamline requirements for U.S. exports and will begin accepting electronic certificates and rescinding apostille requirements and other formalities for U.S. goods. Guatemala committed to addressing existing barriers for U.S. agricultural products, and will refrain from imposing digital services taxes or any other discriminatory measure against U.S. digital services. The Central American country will also prohibit goods from entering the country if they were produced by forced or compulsory labor. “Good news for Guatemala’s economy! After months of intense work and frank dialogue with the United States government, we have become one of the first countries in the world to reach an agreement to reduce and eliminate tariffs,” President Arevalo wrote on social media, sharing a video in Spanish detailing the terms of the trade deal while highlighting the solid relationship between both countries. With Ecuador, President Daniel Noboa committed to reducing or eliminating tariffs for the U.S. in key sectors such as machinery, chemicals, motor vehicles, and agriculture. The United States committed to removing reciprocal tariffs on certain Ecuadorian exports that cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced by the United States in sufficient quantities. Ecuador also committed to addressing non-tariff barriers in a wide array of areas such as agriculture, labor, intellectual property, and advertising services. Ecuador also agreed to maintain high levels of environmental protection and measures to improve forest sector governance, and to combat illegal logging. Additionally, Ecuador will fully eliminate an existing variable tariff on agricultural products, which will create “commercially meaningful market access opportunities” to U.S. exports in that area. “Today’s momentous trade deals reinforce America’s aligned trade relationships with these allies while fostering more reciprocal conditions that prioritize American workers and industries, protecting U.S. national security, and strengthening supply chains in the Western Hemisphere,” the White House said, noting that the U.S. and the four countries will work “expeditiously” to finalize the trade agreements. “President Trump has challenged the assumption that American workers and businesses must tolerate unfair trade practices that have disadvantaged them for decades and contributed to our historic global trade deficit,” the White House continued.

"Listen to this article in summarized format ""The market actually is still obviously earnings-driven, we went through earnings season, but now it's the Fed,"" said Joe Saluzzi, partner, co-founder and head of Equity Market Structure Research and co-head of Equity Trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. ""I see no reason why the uptrend doesn't continue, at least, not as quickly, but maybe more of a grind up to the end of the year."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 295.65 points, or 0.62%, to 47,420.77, the S&P 500 lost 23.22 points, or 0.34%, to 6,825.87 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 68.69 points, or 0.29%, to 23,297.00. While many policymakers have struck a cautious tone, dovish signals from a few key voting members in recent weeks, along with reports that White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett is a leading contender to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have heightened expectations for further monetary easing in the months ahead. Powell is scheduled to speak after the market close but is unlikely to address monetary policy due to the close proximity to the central bank's policy meeting. ""I guess they'll look for hints of anything that he could say, but it looks like it's a done deal,"" said Saluzzi. Investors are also waiting for a delayed September report on the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, due on Friday. Despite expectations for a cut, U.S. Treasury yields were higher on Monday following weakness in Japanese and European government bonds in the wake of comments from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda, who signaled that conditions were aligning for a possible rate hike. Bond yields move inversely to prices. The rise in yields weighed on S&P 500 sectors such as real estate and utilities, which are seen by many investors as bond proxies. Declines were also prevalent among crypto stocks, with Coinbase down 5.1% and U.S. listed shares of Bitfarms losing 6.9%, as bitcoin stumbled about 7% and dropped below $85,000. The crypto market has lost more than $1 trillion in value since hitting a record of around $4.3 trillion, according to CoinGecko. Strategy, the world's largest holder of the cryptocurrency, tumbled 7% after falling more than 12% on the session, and cut its earnings forecast for 2025, citing a weak run in bitcoin. Big-box retailers were in focus as Cyber Monday sales kicked off, with shoppers expected to spend $14.2 billion online, according to Adobe Analytics. Shares of Walmart and Target advanced 1% and 0.5%, respectively. Synopsys gained 4.9% after AI chip leader Nvidia said it had invested $2 billion in the semiconductor design software provider. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.45-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.91-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 63 new lows.

"Listen to this article in summarized format Tariffs & investment: The two wild cards for India’s upside De Guzman noted that Moody’s baseline forecast already factors in ongoing tariff uncertainty with the US. If India and the US strike a trade deal that revives exports, GDP could grow faster than projected.The second big swing factor: private-sector investment, which has remained tepid despite strong narratives around India’s economic transformation. “If the private sector begins participating more meaningfully, complementing government infrastructure push, India could surprise positively,” he said. However, global risks—including geopolitical tensions and weak global demand—also pose potential downside. Domestic demand will be India’s real growth engine Moody’s expects India’s growth to be driven largely by robust domestic demand, not exports. The agency believes India is better insulated than export-heavy Asian economies facing the brunt of tariff wars.A key tailwind is record-low food inflation, which has sharply improved purchasing power for rural and low-income households—segments most sensitive to food price swings. Lower inflation, combined with tax slab reforms that reduced middle-class liabilities and recent GST changes, is likely to support consumption in the coming quarters. Private capex: Improving outlook, but still missing the big leap Despite favourable macro conditions—benign inflation, supportive monetary policy, and sustained public capex—Moody’s says the private sector has not yet turned enthusiastic.While investment activity is happening, the pace hasn’t accelerated meaningfully. “We see an accommodative RBI, strong infrastructure building, and improved connectivity. These will eventually crowd in private investment,” De Guzman said. The next 12–18 months will be crucial to determine whether corporate balance sheets start deploying capital more decisively. Which sectors could surprise? Moody’s points to domestic services Moody’s believes export-linked sectors may stay under pressure due to US tariff uncertainty, but domestic-facing sectors could outperform.- Consumer services - Domestic travel & tourism - Retail & discretionary consumption - Digital and financial services powered by India’s rapidly expanding middle class Private consumption, which makes up the biggest chunk of GDP, is expected to stay strong given the favourable inflation cycle and continued government support. Solid growth, with clear room for upside Moody’s baseline: India will grow at 6.5% in 2025 and 2026. But improved US-India trade relations, a revival in private investment, and strong consumer spending could push India beyond expectations.In a global environment filled with uncertainty, India’s domestic-led growth story gives it a rare tailwind—one that could turn into an upside surprise if key triggers fall into place.

"Just about every major exporting economy was hit by U.S. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Malaysia was no exception, getting a 24% “reciprocal tariff” on its exports to the U.S. which, while perhaps not as catastrophic a level as some of its neighbors, still posed a significant threat to the Southeast Asian economy. Yet, Malaysia’s government took a more measured response to new U.S. protectionism. While Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim criticized Trump’s decision, he also declined to take retaliatory action against the U.S., and tried to build a united Southeast Asian response to Washington’s moves. “When Liberation Day hit, we didn’t panic,” Amir Hamzah Azizan, Malaysia’s Finance Minister II and YB Senator Datuk Seri, explained Monday during the Fortune Innovation Forum in Kuala Lumpur. “We weren’t going out there and saying ‘I’m going to reset my [growth] targets,” he said. Instead, he suggested Malaysia’s broad trade ties to countries like Singapore, China, and the U.S. helped it withstand shocks from any one particular country. “The Malaysian economy has very deep diversification,” he explained, noting no market makes up more than a 30% share of the country’s exports. In late October, the U.S. agreed to lower tariffs on Malaysian goods to 19%, in exchange for Malaysia addressing non-tariff barriers on U.S. goods and providing better market access. The Southeast Asian country also secured tariff exemptions for key exports like palm oil, rubber, aircraft parts, pharmaceuticals, and other key exports. And while Malaysia’s tariffs remain higher than the pre-Liberation Day baseline, relatively steeper tariffs on other economies like China could push supply chains to move to the Southeast Asian country. Balancing the budget Malaysia had a strong third quarter, with GDP growth of 5.2%, as well as a fiscal deficit of 3.8%, far lower than the 6.4% reported during the COVID pandemic. Malaysia turned to fiscal stimulus during those crisis years to stabilize the economy and protect vulnerable populations, yet Amir Hamzah called that level of spending unsustainable. Instead, Malaysia needs to have both financial discipline and targeted investment whose returns flow back into society, in an approach the finance minister called “lifting the ceiling, lifting the floor.” Malaysia has made tough decisions to balance the budget, including raising some taxes and reducing diesel and fuel subsidies. Still, Amir Hamzah noted that only the top 15% of Malaysians reported an increase in their electricity bills, which he characterized as being part of the country’s energy transition. “We have a clear direction forward of how we are going to transition the economy into greener power,” said Amir Hamzah. This includes greater use of renewables such as solar and hydro as well as importing clean electricity through an expanded ASEAN power grid. Malaysia will also encourage the country’s power-hungry data centers to operate more efficiently and use less water, he said. Amir Hamzah credited his business experience for major oil companies like Shell and Petronas for a data-driven approach to solving problems. “What I bring to the table is an ability for us to actually look at raw data [and] start making decisions based on what we need to do,” he said. Moving up the value chain Malaysia is tightly integrated into several global supply chains for advanced manufacturing, including semiconductors, aviation, and automotive parts. The country has played this role since as early as the 1970s, when Intel set up its first non-U.S. chip plant in Penang. “We are not at the top end of the chain…so we are not a threat to the aspirations of the U.S., who wants to bring a lot of things back home,” Amir Hamzah explained. “What we’re doing is [staying] in the middle…and increase the complexity of the economy, and as we do more of that, we strengthen the value chain.” Malaysia now aims to move up the value chain, with forays into both chip design and advanced manufacturing. In March, Malaysia’s government announced that it would pay $250 million for some of Arm Holdings’ advanced chip blueprints, which local chip firms could use in their own designs. Long term, Amir Hamzah said Malaysia was a reliable partner to global companies–including those from the U.S. and China. “Our proposition to both is to say we are key to your long-term supply chain,” he said. “We provide 80 million goods that you need in the long-term to support your growth.”",right
"American companies operating in South Korea say the country’s antitrust regulator has turned enforcement into a political tool that unfairly targets them while protecting domestic competitors, according to a report released Wednesday by the National Bureau of Asian Research (NBR). The 50-page study, “Understanding the Impact of KFTC Enforcement on U.S. Firms,” concludes that the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) has carried out enforcement that “conveys a pattern that firms widely perceive as protectionist” and diverges from global best practices. The report, written by Nigel Cory, a nonresident fellow at NBR, draws on confidential interviews with U.S. executives who described a regulatory environment that is “unpredictable, politicized, and tilted against them.” “The Trump Administration has previously expressed concern about digital barriers like these, and a new report by the National Bureau of Asian Research shows how this regulatory harassment intimidates U.S. companies operating in Korea. The KFTC’s moves are creating a climate of fear that discourages U.S. investment into Korea and damages our bilateral relationship,” said Ambassador Robert O’Brien, the former national security advisor to President Trump said. Aggressive Enforcement Tactics The report says the KFTC routinely launches investigations on minimal evidence, conducts unannounced “dawn raids” on company offices, and threatens employees with criminal prosecution for resisting document requests. Such tactics, it concludes, have created “a climate of fear that discourages investment, chills innovation, and undermines rule of law and fair trade.” Executives told NBR that investigators sometimes occupied offices for weeks, seized proprietary data, and required staff to sign statements before being released from questioning. Several companies reported investigations recurring every two to four months, often coinciding with periods of political scrutiny in the National Assembly. “A lull in investigations makes them nervous,” the report says, describing what it calls a “permanent compliance crisis.” Although South Korea enacted legal amendments in 2020 intended to improve transparency, NBR found that companies “cannot meaningfully review or rebut evidence” before penalties are imposed, preventing them from defending themselves “as they would in other advanced economies.” Pattern of Discrimination NBR found that U.S. companies face disproportionate scrutiny compared with Korean and Chinese competitors. Firms told researchers that the same regulators “are also giving lighter treatment to Korean and Chinese competitors,” a pattern the report says raises concerns about selective enforcement. While the KFTC denies favoritism, NBR says the combination of opaque procedures and political pressure has produced “a regulatory environment viewed by U.S. companies as unpredictable and tilted against them.” In related submissions to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, industry groups used even stronger language. The Computer and Communications Industry Association, the App Association, and others said the KFTC had effectively “weaponized competition law” to harass U.S. firms while sparing domestic conglomerates—a characterization NBR cites in its review of third-party comments. Broader Trade Implications The findings come as the Trump administration presses allies to dismantle what it calls “back-door protectionism.” Officials at the U.S. Trade Representative are examining the report’s conclusions as part of the 2026 National Trade Estimate Report on foreign trade barriers. In earlier filings to that process, the Coalition of Service Industries described Korean enforcement as “a troubling anomaly for a closely allied U.S. trading partner,” and the Computer and Communications Industry Association said the KFTC’s reliance on criminal threats “undermines the regulatory predictability and transparency necessary for cross-border digital trade.” The Competere Foundation, whose economic modeling is cited by NBR, estimates that discriminatory enforcement could cost the U.S. economy $525 billion over ten years, or roughly $3,900 per household, and result in $128 billion in foregone U.S. exports tied to digital-services trade. Competere also projects similar losses for Korean consumers and small businesses. Competere’s modeling hasn’t been independently verified by other economists. Seoul’s New Policy Direction President Lee Jae-myung and KFTC Chairman Ju Byung-ki have advocated a more activist approach to regulating digital platforms. Their proposed Online Platform Fairness Act, modeled on the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, would grant the KFTC new powers to cap service fees and police what it calls “superior bargaining positions.” NBR warns that the proposed legislation would “legally enshrine the unfair treatment that these firms have reported already exists in practice.” While U.S. officials have urged Seoul to reconsider, the report predicts that the KFTC “will continue to pursue its agenda even in the face of staunch domestic and international opposition.” The KFTC has previously stated that its enforcement “applies equally to domestic and foreign firms” and that its actions are aimed at protecting consumers and ensuring fair competition. Korean analysts say public resentment of large technology platforms—most of them foreign—has fueled political pressure for aggressive oversight. Still, NBR cautions that without stronger transparency and procedural safeguards, South Korea’s competition regime risks becoming a de facto non-tariff barrier. “These practices,” Mr. Cory wrote, “amount to a significant non-tariff barrier that undermines a key bilateral economic partnership.” The report’s release places a close U.S. ally under fresh scrutiny just as Washington seeks to rally trading partners behind its broader push against economic nationalism in Asia. “President Trump has worked hard in recent months to rebalance that trade relationship, and it would be a shame if Korea undermines all of that hard work through its KFTC’s discriminatory competition enforcement practices, proposed digital trade bills, and unfair mapping data restrictions that target U.S. firms like Google, Apple, Meta, and Coupang. A firm, coordinated U.S. response is essential to safeguard fair treatment of U.S. companies and maintain strategic balance against China’s growing economic influence,” O’Brien, the former national security advisor, said.

"The speculation intensified after Trump again mentioned tariff-funded rebate checks. He previously suggested payments of $1,000 to $2,000 and even floated figures up to $5,000 earlier in July alongside former DOGE chief Elon Musk, according to Axios. None of these ideas became formal legislation. Congress has not introduced or approved any stimulus bill. The IRS has also not prepared any new rollout. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he has not discussed stimulus checks with the president and noted that the administration’s tax agenda—such as no tax on tips, overtime, or Social Security—may offer relief instead. The last real stimulus-related payment available to Americans was the $1,400 Recovery Rebate Credit tied to the 2021 pandemic package. The final deadline to claim it was April 15, 2025. No new program has been announced since. The IRS warns that stimulus misinformation has triggered a new wave of scams. Fraudsters misuse the term “stimulus check” and attempt to steal banking information, Social Security numbers, and refunds. The IRS never sends messages through social media. It never texts taxpayers without consent. It never calls to demand payments, threaten arrest, or promise fast refunds. The agency stresses that any real stimulus would require Congressional approval, a signed law, and an official IRS announcement. None of these steps have occurred. As of mid-November 2025, there are no IRS payments, no pending stimulus bills, and no federal rebate checks coming this year. The circulating November stimulus rumors remain false. No IRS Stimulus Check Is Scheduled for November 2025 Searches for “IRS stimulus check November 2025” have exploded. Viral posts claim new payments worth $1,390, $1,702, or $2,000 are arriving through direct deposit.But the IRS has not announced any new stimulus or federal relief payments for 2025 or 2026. The IRS newsroom for November lists only routine tax updates. Its Economic Impact Payment page is now marked historical, confirming that all COVID-era stimulus checks ended with the 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit. Major U.S. outlets are consistent on this point. Reports note that no federal stimulus checks are approved for the rest of 2025, and no IRS program is running any national direct deposit relief payments. Any post promising a surprise “IRS stimulus arriving this week” has no official basis. Why $1,390, $1,702 and $2,000 Went Viral Online The dollar amounts circulating on TikTok, YouTube, and Facebook come from a mix of real programs and false claims.The $1,702 number usually traces back to Alaska’s 2024–2025 Permanent Fund Dividend, which is only for Alaska residents. It is not a national IRS payment. The $1,390 figure appears in widely reported scam posts. Consumer alerts in multiple states have flagged fake messages using this amount to lure people into sharing personal details. The $2,000 figure comes from a political proposal, not a live federal program. None of these amounts represent an active IRS direct deposit stimulus check in November 2025. If a message links to a sign-up page or asks for bank login details, it is not legitimate. Trump’s $2,000 Tariff Dividend: A Real Proposal, Not an IRS Payment Yet President Donald Trump has promoted a $2,000 “tariff dividend” plan. He claims revenue from global tariffs could be paid out to millions of Americans.The White House says Trump is committed to exploring this design. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has floated income limits similar to past stimulus. But the plan is not law. Congress must approve funding and authorize the IRS to distribute payments. Budget analysts say current tariff revenue is far too small to cover broad $2,000 payments. A Supreme Court review of the tariffs adds even more uncertainty. For now, the tariff dividend remains a proposal, not a real IRS stimulus check. DOGE Checks and the DOGE Dividend Are Policy Ideas, Not Active Payments Posts about “DOGE checks” or a “DOGE dividend” continue to spread online. These refer to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and a proposal that some savings could be paid to taxpayers.The concept has generated attention, especially after high-profile endorsements. However, DOGE has not launched any payment system. Independent reviews show that documented savings fall far short of what would be required for nationwide payouts. No DOGE payments are scheduled for November 2025, and no IRS infrastructure exists for such checks. How to Avoid 2025 IRS Stimulus Scams Scams are rising as fake posts imitate IRS branding. The IRS warns that it never initiates stimulus or refund contact through text, email, or social media.Fraud attempts often use urgent language, ask you to “verify your bank details,” or demand a fee to “release” a payment.

"Pessimism about the country’s future has risen in cities since last year, but rural America is more optimistic about what’s ahead for the U.S., according to a new survey from the American Communities Project. And despite President Donald Trump’s insistence that crime is out of control in big cities, residents of the nation’s largest metropolitan centers are less likely to list crime and gun violence among the chief concerns facing their communities than they were a couple years ago. Optimism about the future is also down from last year in areas with large Hispanic communities. These are some of the snapshots from the new ACP/Ipsos survey, which offers a nuanced look at local concerns by breaking the nation’s counties into community types, using data points like race, income, age and religious affiliation. The survey evaluated moods and priorities across the 15 different community types, such as heavily Hispanic areas, big cities and different kinds of rural communities. The common denominator across the communities? A gnawing worry about daily household costs. “Concerns about inflation are across the board,” said Dante Chinni, founder and director of ACP. “One thing that truly unites the country is economic angst.” Rising optimism in rural areas, despite economic anxiety Rural residents are feeling more upbeat about the country’s trajectory — even though most aren’t seeing Trump’s promised economic revival. The $15 price tag on a variety pack of Halloween candy at the Kroger supermarket last month struck Carl Gruber. Disabled and receiving federal food aid, the 42-year-old from Newark, Ohio, had hardly been oblivious to lingering, high supermarket prices. But Gruber, whose wife also is unable to work, is hopeful about the nation’s future, primarily in the belief that prices will moderate as Trump suggests. “Right now, the president is trying to get companies who moved their businesses out of the country to move them back,” said Gruber, a Trump voter whose support has wavered over the federal shutdown that delayed his monthly food benefit. “So, maybe we’ll start to see prices come down.” About 6 in 10 residents of Rural Middle America — Newark’s classification in the survey — say they are hopeful about the country’s future over the next few years, up from 43% in the 2024 ACP survey. Other communities, like heavily evangelical areas or working-class rural regions, have also seen an uptick in optimism. Kimmie Pace, a 33-year-old unemployed mother of four from a small town in northwest Georgia, said, “I have anxiety every time I go to the grocery store.” But she, too, is hopeful in Trump. “Trump’s in charge, and I trust him, even if we’re not seeing the benefits yet,” she said. Big-city residents are worried about the future By contrast, the share of big-city residents who say they are hopeful about the nation’s future has shrunk, from 55% last year to 45% in the new survey. Robert Engel of San Antonio — Texas’ booming, second most-populous city — is worried about what’s next for the U.S., though less for his generation than the next. The 61-year-old federal worker, whose employment was not interrupted by the government shutdown nor Trump’s effort to reduce the federal workforce, is near retirement and feels financially stable. A stable job market, health care availability and a fair economic environment for his adult children are his main priorities. Recently, the inflation outlook has worsened under Trump. Consumer prices in September increased at an annual rate of 3%, up from 2.3% in April, when the president first began to roll out substantial tariff increases that burdened the economy with uncertainty. Engel’s less-hopeful outlook for the country is broader. “It’s not just the economy, but the state of democracy and polarization,” Engel said. “It’s a real worry. I try to be cautiously optimistic, but it’s very, very hard.” Crime, gun violence are less a concern in urban America Trump had threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New York, Seattle, Baltimore, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to fight what he said was runaway, urban crime. Yet data shows most violent crime in those places, and around the country, has declined in recent years. That tracks with the poll, which found that residents of America’s Big Cities and Middle Suburbs are less likely to list crime or gun violence among the top issues facing their communities than they were in 2023. For Angel Gamboa, a retired municipal worker in Austin, Texas, Trump’s claims don’t ring true in the city of roughly 1 million people. “I don’t want to say it’s overblown, because crime is a serious subject,” Gamboa said. “But I feel like there’s an agenda to scare Americans, and it’s so unnecessary.” Instead, residents of Big Cities are more likely to say immigration and health care are important issues for their communities. Big Cities are one of the community types where residents are most likely to say they’ve seen changes in immigration recently, with 65% saying they’ve seen a change in their community related to immigration over the past 12 months, compared with only about 4 in 10 residents of communities labeled in the survey as Evangelical Hubs or Rural Middle America. Gamboa says he has witnessed changes, notably outside an Austin Home Depot, where day laborers regularly would gather in the mornings to find work. Not anymore, he said. “Immigrants were not showing up there to commit crimes,” Gamboa said. “They were showing up to help their families. But when ICE was in the parking lot, that’s all it took to scatter people who were just trying to find a job.” Hispanic communities are less hopeful about the future After Hispanic voters moved sharply toward Trump in the 2024 election, the poll shows that residents of heavily Hispanic areas are feeling worse about the future of their communities than they were before Trump was elected. Carmen Maldonado describes her community of Kissimmee, Florida, a fast-growing, majority-Hispanic city of about 80,000 residents about 22 miles (35 kilometers) south of Orlando, as “seriously troubled.” The 61-year-old retired, active-duty National Guard member isn’t alone. The survey found that 58% of residents of such communities are hopeful about the future of their community, down from 78% last year. “It’s not just hopelessness, but fear,” said Maldonado, who says people in her community — even her fellow native Puerto Ricans, who are American citizens — are anxious about the Trump administration’s aggressive pursuit of Latino immigrants. Just over a year ago, Trump made substantial inroads with Hispanic voters in the 2024 presidential election. Beyond just the future of their communities, Hispanic respondents are also substantially less likely to say they’re hopeful about the future of their children or the next generation: 55% this year, down from 69% in July 2024. Maldonado worries that the Trump administration’s policies have stoked anti-Hispanic attitudes and that they will last for her adult child’s lifetime and beyond. “My hopelessness comes from the fact that we are a large part of what makes up the United States,” she said, “and sometimes I cry thinking about these families.” ___ Parwani and Thomson-DeVeaux reported from Washington. ___",right
