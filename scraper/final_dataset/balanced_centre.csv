"Texas Gov. Abbott says he’ll ‘impose 100% tariff’ on New Yorkers who move in Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) wrote on the eve of Election Day that he would impose tariffs on any New Yorker who moves to Texas after voting ended. “After the polls close tomorrow night, I will impose a 100% tariff on anyone moving to Texas from NYC,” Abbott posted on social platform X. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for more information from NewsNation, The Hill’s sister network, on how those tariffs would work. The power to impose tariffs falls within the federal government’s authority in the Constitution, not the states. The race for New York City mayor has been closely watched nationally. President Trump endorsed independent candidate Andrew Cuomo on Truth Social. Trump’s endorsement read in part, “Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, [Zohran] Mamdani is not!” Mamdani is the front-runner in the mayoral race based on polling on Oct. 29 from Quinnipiac University. Polling suggested Mamdani had a lead with 43 percent, followed by Cuomo with 33 percent and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa with 14 percent. Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

"Households face unexpected rise in energy prices in new year - Published Millions of households will see a slight rise in energy prices in the depths of winter, after regulator Ofgem outlined its next price cap. The 0.2% increase from the current cap will take effect at the start of January, and affect those on variable tariffs in England, Wales and Scotland. The rise was a surprise after forecasters suggested the cap may fall at the start of the year. Government policy is primarily behind the shift. Gas and electricity bills remain relatively high, and the sudden drop in temperature has brought the costs to the forefront of people's minds. ""While wholesale energy costs are stabilising, they still make up the largest portion of our bills which leaves us open to volatile prices,"" said Tim Jarvis, from Ofgem. Rising electricity unit rates are behind the latest change, offset by a slight fall in gas rates. So, heavy users of electricity will see the biggest impact. Prices will be slightly lower than the same period the previous year, but Mr Jarvis said the cap was a backstop and people could take action - such as shopping around for a fixed tariff - to reduce their bill. Ofgem said the price cap change was driven by government policy costs and operating costs, such as funding the Sizewell C nuclear project which adds Â£1 a month to a typical bill. The cap sets the maximum price for each unit of gas and electricity, not the total bill - so those who use more energy, pay more. The Ofgem cap is illustrated with a household using a ""typical"" amount of 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. This household would see a Â£3 rise in its annual bill from Â£1,755 to Â£1,758. However, the amount used varies significantly between households, so the best way to calculate the change is to work out the percentage change from your own usual annual bill. Standing charges - the fixed costs that cover the cost of running the network as well as government levies - will rise by 2% for electricity and 3% for gas. Dame Clare Moriarty from Citizens Advice said: ""With bills still drastically higher than before the energy crisis, and due to rise again from April, it's high time for decisions about the longer term."" At St Nicholas Church in Maidstone, Kent, there is a community hub for parents and toddlers in one room, and a get together over tea and cake for the older generation in another. Liz Walker, one of the organisers of the morning cafe, said small changes had helped everyone with the cost of energy. ""We are into winter now and we open the doors earlier, as we have for the last three years, because it means some people won't have to put their heating on for the whole morning."" Debt worries Charities say they are seeing people owing increasing levels of unpaid bills and charges to suppliers. The total amount owed has reached a record Â£4.4bn, prompting plans from Ofgem to ensure energy companies write off some of that debt. Up to Â£500m could be knocked off the total under plans the regulator wants to take effect next year. Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said anyone facing difficulties paying should contact their energy provider as soon as possible. ""We know that far too many people are struggling to pay for the energy they need to use,"" she said. But she added suppliers could help with efficient appliances, more tailored tariffs or ensuring people were on the correct benefits. Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, which had expected the cap to fall, said Ofgem's announcement marked ""the beginning of a potential trend"" in which the main driver of higher bills would be government policies as opposed to higher wholesale energy prices. Principal consultant Dr Craig Lowrey said households faced bills rising further in April due to the costs of running the energy network and transitioning to net zero. But he added: ""A low carbon system means more energy security and less exposure to the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices."" The government has hinted at extra cost-of-living support in next week's Budget. One option said to be under consideration is removing VAT from energy bills, which would cut about Â£80 from annual bills. Dr Lowrey said any support would be ""zero-sum"" as ""these costs will still need to be recovered, whether through bills or through taxes, as the pipes, wires, and networks that keep the lights on still need investment as we move to a cleaner, more secure energy system"". Energy Minister Martin McCluskey said energy bills ""remain too high"", but that the government was taking action, with ""millions more families receiving Â£150 off their bills through the expanded Warm Home Discount scheme"". But the Conservatives said Labour's net zero policies were ""making energy unaffordable"". Shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho said: ""Ed Miliband promised to cut everyone's energy bills by Â£300 but more and more experts are sounding the alarm that his plans will lock us into paying higher bills for decades.""

"Brazil's Supreme Court has ruled that former president Jair Bolsonaro's coup conviction was final, with no more appeals allowed, clearing the way for him to begin serving a 27-year sentence. Bolsonaro, aged 70, was in September convicted over a scheme to stop leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after the 2022 elections, and that included an assassination plot. The Supreme Court rejected an appeal to his sentence earlier this month, and ruled the judgment was now final. The former army captain who fired up Brazil's conservatives to become president in 2019 and reshaped the country's politics will now have to serve the lengthy jail term. Bolsonaro had been under house arrest until Saturday, when he was detained at police headquarters in the capital Brasilia for tampering with his ankle monitor using a soldering iron. Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes said there had been ""very serious indications of a possible attempt to flee"" during a planned vigil organised by Bolsonaro's son outside his home. The justice pointed to the location of the nearby US embassy, and Bolsonaro's close relationship with US President Donald Trump, suggesting he may have tried to escape to seek political asylum. During a hearing on Sunday in Brasilia, Bolsonaro stated he ""experienced a certain paranoia between Friday and Saturday due to medication"", according to a Supreme Court document obtained by AFP. He also asserted ""that he had no intention of fleeing and that there was no breakage of the bracelet's strap"". In a video made public by the court on Saturday, Bolsonaro gave a different version of events: he said he had used a soldering iron on the monitoring bracelet out of ""curiosity"". Shortly before Bolsonaro tampered with the device, his lawyers had petitioned the court to allow him to serve out his sentence at home due to ill health.

"Guinness owner Diageo cut its sales and profit forecasts today, tipping its shares to a decade-low, as the world's top spirits maker left investors hanging on who its permanent CEO will be. Stubbornly low sales in the US and China, two crucial spirits markets where consumer confidence is low or their spending stretched, are punishing the maker of Johnnie Walker whisky and Smirnoff vodka along with its rivals. ""There's much more for us to do, and we need to go faster,"" said interim CEO Nik Jhangiani after Diageo's first quarter trading update, adding the performance was unsatisfactory. Diageo is attempting to cut costs and sell assets as the drinks industry faces cooling post-pandemic demand, tariff-related uncertainty and shifting consumer habits. Shares in Diageo slipped 5.3% to levels last seen in 2015, compounding an almost 30% fall so far this year. Jhangiani, who stepped in after the abrupt exit of former Diageo CEO Debra Crew in July, previously said he expected a decision on a permanent replacement by the end of October. But the company did not provide an update today. Cranley Macfarlane, deputy chief investment officer at Diageo investor Church House Investments, said this raised questions over why Jhangiani has not been confirmed in the CEO role on a permanent basis, as some had expected. Others said it also raised doubts over strategy. ""There is a plan in place which is going in the right direction, but whether a new CEO has a different view and a different strategy, no one will know until a permanent CEO is in place,"" said Richard Scrope, manager of the VT Tyndall Global Select Fund, which also holds Diageo stock. Diageo said it now expects 2026 sales to be flat or slightly lower with only low to mid single-digit operating profit growth. It had earlier forecast annual sales performance similar to last year, when sales grew 1.7%, along with mid single-digit operating profit growth in 2026. The decision to revise the outlook came despite a better-than-expected, albeit flat, first-quarter sales performance. Diageo flagged a double-digit decline in sales in China, driven by a drop in consumption of national spirit baijiu. Meanwhile, in the US, its sales fell 4.1% with a steep drop in tequilas such as Don Julio, which has been a critical growth engine for Diageo.",centre
"European companies that make products from copper have warned they are facing critical shortages unless the EU takes action to curb exports of scrap, as it has for aluminium. Large amounts of refined copper have been shipped to the US by investors attracted by higher prices there based on tariff expectations. At the same time, exports of copper scrap from the EU have surged by 31% since 2022, with about half going to China, according to a position paper issued by companies accounting for more than 90% of European copper scrap usage. ""What makes me nervous is there's a high risk of a cathode shortage in Europe next year,"" said Uwe Schmidt, an executive at German metal products producer Wieland. ""Scrap shortage and cathode shortage will be a dangerous mixture for the semi-fabricators,"" he said. Cathodes are slabs of refined copper and fabricators use copper to produce a variety of semi-finished products such as wire, tubes and rods. The European Commission earlier this week announced plans to restrict EU exports of scrap aluminium to stop the metal flooding out of the bloc. It would be logical for the EU to do the same for the copper industry, Schmidt said. The companies named in the industry paper also included Aurubis, ElvalHalcor and La Farga.",centre
"The United States and Britain have announced a deal to secure zero tariffs on British pharmaceutical products and medical technology in return for Britain spending more on medicines and overhauling how it values drugs. Under the agreement, Britain will raise the net price it pays for new US medicines by 25%. In return, UK-made medicines, drug ingredients and medical technology will be exempt from Section 232 sectoral tariffs and any future Section 301 country tariffs. ""The United States and the United Kingdom announce this negotiated outcome pricing for innovative pharmaceuticals, which will help drive investment and innovation in both countries,"" United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement. The agreement means Britain will be exempted from hefty US tariffs imposed on pharma imports that went into effect on 1 October. The deal includes a significant change to the value appraisal framework at NICE, which is the UK body that determines whether new drugs are cost-effective for the NHS. NICE's ""quality-adjusted life year"" threshold, currently £30,000 per year, will rise to £35,000. The British government said the change to NICE would let it ""keep pace with the commercial and economic environment in which pharmaceutical companies are operating in today."" The revised framework will apply to all new medicines, not just US drugs, but will not affect prices of existing treatments. NICE has often rejected coverage of new, expensive drugs through the NHS, for example Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's drug and AstraZeneca's breast cancer treatment Enhertu. British pharmaceutical industry group ABPI said the deal would help British patients access new medicines and help attract investment from drugmakers. Shares in UK-based drugmakers GSK and AstraZeneca were broadly unchanged on the agreement. The UK is a very small market for the pharmaceutical industry, making up just 2% of AstraZeneca's total revenue for instance. GSK welcomed the deal, saying ""these good foundations, offer a real opportunity to secure the UK as an attractive global-leading environment for life sciences that rewards long-term innovation."" US President Donald Trump has pressed Britain and the rest of Europe to pay more for American medicines, part of his push for US medicine costs to be brought more in line with those paid in other wealthy nations. The industry has criticised a tough operating environment in Britain and some major firms have cancelled or paused investment in Britain, including AstraZeneca, the largest firm on the London Stock Exchange by market value. One point of contention between the sector and the government has been the operation of a voluntary pricing scheme which sees firms put a proportion of sales to the NHS back into the health service. The office of the USTR said Britain had committed that the rebate rate would decrease to 15% in 2026. The breakthrough comes after the two countries agreed in May to seek ""significantly preferential treatment outcomes on pharmaceuticals"", with a commitment that Britain tries to improve the environment for pharma firms operating in the country. It concludes talks on a major unresolved issue after Britain became the first country to secure tariff relief on some other sectors in May. The European Union and US agreed a trade deal in July that capped tariffs on exports on pharmaceuticals, and most other goods, from the EU at 15%.",centre
"European leaders flocked to Angola this week to strike deals and deepen cooperation with their African counterparts, as global tensions mount. ""Africa and Europe are partners of choice, bound by common interests and priorities and shared values,"" EU Council President António Costa posted on social media before the EU-African Union (AU) Summit kicked off on Monday. ""In a turbulent world, our commitment to build a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable future - and to defend multilateralism - must guide our actions,"" he wrote. Of course, Africa and Europe were not always partners of choice. For much of modern history, European nations conquered and plundered the continent, seizing its abundant natural resources for their own enrichment. As delegates gathered in the capital, Luanda, the country had just celebrated 50 years since gaining independence from Portugal. For the previous 400 years, Portugal had ruled over the oil and diamond-rich nation, which by the 19th Century, was the largest source of slaves for the Americas. A brutal 40-year civil war followed independence and today, Angola remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. Landmine victims can be seen on the streets of the capital. Despite the country’s enormous wealth, little of it appears to trickle down. ""We earn less than a hundred US dollars a month,"" one Luanda tour operator told RTÉ News. Asked can you live on that here, he answered: ""We don’t live, we survive"". He was hopeful about the Europeans being in town. ""There needs to be more investment here,"" he said, ""instead of the money going overseas"". Today, Africa’s natural resources are once again very much in demand. The continent is home to more than half of the world’s cobalt reserves - essential for rechargeable batteries, wind turbines and even some nuclear weapons. There are also vast reserves of copper, lithium and manganese. And then there are Africa's human resources. As populations in Europe and Asia tip into decline, Africa’s is set to grow. It will be home to a quarter of the world’s people in 2050 and top four billion by century’s end. ""I think the potential, if you look two to three decades ahead, is Africa,"" Taoiseach Micheál Martin said as the AU-EU Summit began, ""in terms of population growth, in terms of the importance of what will be a significant economic market in time"". The European Union is still the biggest market for African countries, he said. ""So, it is very important to have a structured, sustainable, respectful and mutually beneficial relationship with Africa,"" he added. Europe, still reeling from the US trade tariffs and China’s export control on critical minerals, wants to shore up its supply chain resilience. ""I believe there has been less progress than the EU hoped for,"" Adrian Joseph from the South African Institute of International Affairs said. While European and African nations have struck deals on critical minerals - the most recent on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Johannesburg last week - the roadmaps that accompany them are not publicly available, he said. ""This makes is difficult to assess progress,"" he said, adding ""a lack of transparency around these agreements is naturally not only an implementation problem, but also an accountability issue"". For Africa, there remains a risk of exploitation, Mr Joseph said. ""In the absence of any serious reforms, there is a real risk that the extraction of the critical minerals needed to power the energy transition could occur at the expense of citizens and the environment in African countries,"" he added. However, African leaders were clear in their demands. In return for supplying Europe with critical minerals, they want the EU to open up its market. In his address to the summit, Chairperson of the AU Commission Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said: ""We are calling for more balanced trade partnerships. ""I’m pleading for European investments in the transformation process of our minerals on the continent. ""I’m calling for the lifting of any tariff hampering the access of African products to the European market."" Of course, in eyeing up Africa’s natural wealth, Europe is not alone. ""There are other interests involved in Africa,"" Mr Martin told reporters, ""including Russia and China"". Indeed, China has been investing heavily in the continent for decades. More than 50 African countries signed up to China's leader Xi Jinping’s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure development project. Luanda’s gleaming new international airport, for example, is Chinese-built. Now with so much interest flowing from wealthy nations, African governments could be in a position to choose the best deals, analysts said. ""It is about which partners can provide the best value proposition to African countries seeking investments in their mining sectors, as these countries are not eager to become entangled in the geopolitical tensions between the US and China,"" Mr Joseph said.",centre
"The European Commission has recalled consignments of frozen Brazilian beef products imported into the EU, after it was found they contained hormones banned in the bloc. The banned hormones were detected in shipments that arrived into Europe earlier this month. Authorities in a number of countries have removed affected products from sale, and issued recalls where necessary. EU countries impacted by the situation include Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Slovakia. The United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) is also among the countries affected. The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) has said the recalls of Brazilian beef raise questions about controls in Brazil. IFA President Francie Gorman said they ""raise very significant concerns around the lack of robust controls in slaughterhouses in Brazil, which has allowed hormone beef to enter the EU and be sold to European citizens"". He added the findings ""have to be a serious wake-up call for the bureaucrats and cheerleaders attempting to usher through a Mercosur trade deal for the benefit of big industry at the expense of European farmers and the health and wellbeing of EU citizens"". It comes after a recent investigation from the Irish Farmers Journal, which claimed to have been able to buy animal antibiotics in Brazil without prescriptions, and hormones banned in the EU. The European Commission is pushing for the ratification of Mercosur, which would create the world's biggest free-trade zone and significantly increase EU exports to Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Mercosur countries would be able to export up to 99,000 tonnes of beef into the EU at a much-reduced tariff rate of 7.5%, as well as 180,000 tonnes of poultry. Several EU member states, notably Ireland and France, are opposed to its ratification, citing the potential to massively distort key agricultural markets.",centre
"UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell has said all populations and all economies need to get results from the COP30 climate talks, but added time is running out. He was speaking as the climate negotiations in Belém, Brazil, have reached the halfway mark. Mr Stiell hinted at impasses over critical issues such as providing climate finance and transitioning away from fossil fuels, and urged the negotiators to push further to find compromises. With government ministers, including Ireland's Minister for Climate Daragh O'Brien, arriving in Belém before Monday, the focus is about to shift from technical drafting of proposed agreements and declarations to tricky high-stakes diplomacy and decision-making. Energy, finance, climate adaptation and climate ambition will be the key battlegrounds. Mr Stiell has hinted strongly about log jams and stalled progress on key issues which could include climate finance, transparency, ambition, and matters that impact on international trade. He appealed last night to the negotiators to make it as easy as possible for governments to compromise by pushing themselves further and sticking to the painstaking yet crucial work behind the scenes. Mr Stiell said certain climate issue that are not a priority for some countries are clearly issues and priorities for others. He added that the negotiating process must deliver strong results. That requires listening to and understanding the issues that matter most to other nations and groups, he said. He told the negotiators from 194 countries, plus the EU, that if they do not align and find common ground on issues important to others, then COP30 will not deliver outcomes that show the Paris Climate Agreement is working. He asked them to seek out and find each other in hallways to iron out their difficulties. ""It is not clear if every national negotiating team is prepared to be at the table discussing the critical issues, but the negotiations need to get past this point quickly,"" he said. Mr Stiell said that the prospect of a hotter, poorer and less healthy world, along with the human and economic losses caused by climate change, strongly underscores just how important it is for COP30 to achieve a good outcome. Earlier, the Executive Secretary had appealed to the parties negotiating to make progress in relation to the provision of climate finance for poorer countries. Mr Stiell said such assistance is the life blood of climate action. ""It is what turns climate plans into progress and climate ambition into implementation. He reiterated that providing climate finance is not an act of charity by rich nations. Rather, he said, it is smart economics, because climate action, underpinned by climate finance, is the growth story of the 21st century. When climate finance is made available, ambition grows. It enables climate plans to be implemented, which creates jobs, reduces the cost of living, improves health, protects communities, and secures a prosperous and more resilient planet for all. Prominent Climate Scientist Katherine Hayhoe, who is the Chief Scientist at The Nature Conservancy, and speaker on behalf of Nature4Climate, a global coalition of environmental organisations, said COP30 has lived up to its promise of being an implementation cop during its first week. She said she was pleased to hear indigenous voices at the negotiating table, and to see the role of nature take centre stage in climate solutions. Ms Hayhoe was referring to initiatives such as the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, launched by the Brazilian COP30 Presidency in the first few days. She described this facility as a potential game-changer for curbing deforestation. It aims to raise €125 billion per year to reward countries for preserving rainforests like the Amazon. The idea is to ensure a hectare of rainforest will always be worth more than a hectare of land cleared for farming. This will ensure that any incentive to cut down the trees is removed. Two days after it was announced, the Tropical Forest Forever Facility had attracted commitments of $5.5 billion in funding from Norway, Brazil, France, Germany, China and others. Ireland did not invest. Taoiseach Micheál Martin described it as ""interesting"" and said his Government will assess it. Week one of COP30 has seen unprecedented attention paid to climate misinformation and efforts to ensure people have accurate and factual information for responsible decisions. However, there is no guarantee that week two will run as smoothly. The outcome depends critically on how ministers and negotiators tackle the continued global reliance on fossil fuels. Melissa, a Category 5 hurricane, tore through the Caribbean, severely impacting Jamaica just three days before the COP30 leaders' summit. The Philippines was also hit by its second major typhoon in a single week. Heat waves, floods, wildfires and droughts are becoming more severe and putting more people at risk every single year. Ms Hayhoe said a strong outcome to the Belém climate talks would send a powerful signal of solidarity and hope to the communities on the front lines of climate change. Every line in the draft COP30 text represents lives, livelihoods and ecosystems. There are some very tricky issues for government ministers to deal with in week two the negotiations. The obligation of developed countries to provide finance for poorer countries is certainly one. Another concerns issues around trade and the potential consequences of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism for international trade rules. Such a mechanism could also significantly disadvantage already vulnerable poorer nations trying to export into bigger markets. For them, a carbon border price adjustment imposed on their products might be akin to a tariff. There is also the issue of transparency and building trust, within and between countries about climate measures and climate actions that we are told are being implemented. It is one thing for a country to give certain commitments in response to international climate targets. It is quite another for them to live up to those promises, commitment and turn them into action. This focus on transparency issues over the coming week will shift the international climate policy focus from simply registering and recording national climate pledges to a focus on monitoring and policing the implementation of climate commitments. This is a fundamental shift. It is key to ensuring that COP30 is truly an implementation COP as has been promised by Brazil's President Lula.",centre
"World champions South Africa beat Ireland 24-13 at the Aviva Stadium to claim their first win in Dublin since 2012. Andy Farrell's side had four players sent to the sin-bin and James Ryan was red-carded. Here's how we rated the players on a tough night for the hosts. 15. Mack Hansen – 7 Battled hard but didn't get a decent share of the high balls, succumbed to injury late on. Made a good run early on that came to nothing. Carried six times for over 20 metres, looks at home at full-back. 14. Tommy O’Brien - 6 Hustled hard and was hit hard by the ravenous Springboks. The tackle from Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu that was deemed just a penalty should have had a higher tariff. Failed his head injury assessment before half-time after giving away a penalty. 13. Garry Ringrose – 7 Met fire with fire in the midfield but was starved of much in the way of quality ball. Carried 10 times for some hard yards, missed a couple of tackles but not alone. 12. Bundee Aki – 6 Ireland needed more of an impact from their most physical back, who made over nine metres off seven carries. However, has to be noted that he had to pack down on the side of the scrum for most of the game. 11. James Lowe – 7 Ireland’s top carrier with 12. The winger broke free a couple of times and drew multiple defenders otherwise. Was first on the scene before Tadhg Beirne’s disallowed try. Got blocked down as Ireland chased late on and had Jack Crowley to thank for preventing a try. 10. Sam Prendergast – 6.5 A mixed game for the out-half and he paid the price for a series of offside penalties at the end of the first half. Missed a kickable penalty that indirectly led to James Ryan’s red card but landed a more difficult one in the second half. Missed just one of 12 tackle attempts. 9. Jamison Gibson-Park – 7 Didn’t get much to work with due to the scrum issues. Did very well to clear his lines under pressure a couple of times. Won’t be happy with his tackle for South Africa’s only try of the second half. Beautiful assist pass for Ireland’s try. 1. Andrew Porter – 5.5 Understandable as it was, the Irish scrum was demolished. Porter gave away four penalties and was sent to the bin. Made a couple of big carries early on and 11 tackles. 2. Dan Sheehan – 6.5 Took his try very well, powering over from close range. However, Ireland’s lineout was again an issue, admittedly under pressure. 3. Tadhg Furlong – 6 Not a day for the Irish front row and Furlong missed three tackles as well. Battled away but the 'bread and butter’ as Andy Farrell might say, wasn’t covered. 4. James Ryan – 4 Started with intent and won a turnover. Can’t have any real complaints about his red card, which was upgraded from yellow after a bunker review. Ireland needed him for more than 20 minutes. 5. Tadhg Beirne – 6 Beirne was quite by his own standards as Ireland were largely in fire-fighting mode. Racked up nine tackles and had a turnover to his name but also conceded two penalties. 6. Ryan Baird – 7 One of Ireland’s better performers. Made a big tackle, one of nine, on Jasper Wiese that resulted in a turnover close to the line. Limped off near the end after another big shift. Took three lineouts. 7. Josh van der Flier – 7 Started off like a man with a point to prove and left everything out there. Must have been hard to know if he was coming or going with the amount of enforced switches Ireland had to make. Made 12 tackles. 8. Caelan Doris – 7.5 The captain was Ireland’s top tackler with 14. Constantly put himself in harm’s way and did his best to put Ireland on the front foot. Made nine carries but the stats show he conceded three turnovers. Great to have him back after a lengthy layoff before November. Replacements. 16. Rónan Kelleher (for Sheehan 56) – 6 Made a nice hit on Leinster team-mate RG Snyman. 17. Paddy McCarthy (for Van der Flier, 40-49, and for Porter, 60-70) – 7.5 Made a immediate impact after coming on, credited with two turnovers. Big find for Ireland in this window. Was yellow carded but who wasn’t? 18. Finlay Bealham (for Furlong 60) – 6 Made himself available to carry plenty of ball. 19. Cian Prendergast (for Ryan (red card) 39 ) – 7.5 Took four lineouts and busied himself when called earlier than expected. Knock on led to South Africa's fourth try but otherwise did very well. 20. Jack Conan (for Baird 60) – 6.5 Tried hard to make an impact. 21. Craig Casey (for Ringrose 72) – 6 Did his best to get something going. 22. Jack Crowley (for O’Brien 32 HIA) – 5.5 Saved a couple of tries with scramble defence but yellow carded for an effort that he was never going to get away with. 23. Tom Farrell (for Hansen 64) – 6 Made two tackles, missed one after replacing Hansen.",centre
"This year is on track to be the second or third warmest globally as an ""unprecedented streak"" of high temperatures continues, UN scientists have warned. Global average surface temperatures in January to August 2025 were 1.42C above pre-industrial levels, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said, a slight drop from the record highs of 1.55C in 2024. As world leaders gather in Belém, Brazil, for the latest round of UN climate talks, the WMO said it was ""virtually impossible"" to curb global warming to the agreed limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in the next few years without temporarily overshooting the target. But it is ""still entirely possible and essential"" to bring temperatures down to the 1.5C goal by the end of the century, WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo said. Watch: More leaders need to 'tell it as it is' om climate, Taoiseach tells COP30 The latest UN talks come in the wake of a year in which people around the world have been battered by climate and weather extremes from damaging rainfall and floods to severe heat and wildfire - but as politicians in a number of countries seek to row back on action to combat the worsening situation. This year has been slightly cooler than last year as the El Niño climate phenomenon in the tropical Pacific, which boosted global temperatures in 2023 and 2024, shifted to neutral conditions at the start of 2025. The El Niño/La Niña pattern influences the global climate in addition to the warming caused by humans burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests, which put heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, pushing up temperatures and sea levels and causing more extreme weather. The WMO's analysis finds that the past 11 years - from 2015, when countries signed up to the Paris Agreement to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C to avoid its worst impacts, to 2025 - are individually the 11 warmest on record. The past three years have been the three warmest years in the record stretching back 176 years, the WMO said. The UN's meteorological agency also warned that concentrations of greenhouse gases, which reached record levels in 2024, continued to rise in 2025. Ms Saulo said: ""This unprecedented streak of high temperatures, combined with last year's record increase in greenhouse gas levels, makes it clear that it will be virtually impossible to limit global warming to 1.5C in the next few years without temporarily overshooting this target. ""But the science is equally clear that it's still entirely possible and essential to bring temperatures back down to 1.5C by the end of the century."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned: ""Each year above 1.5C will hammer economies, deepen inequalities and inflict irreversible damage. ""We must act now, at great speed and scale, to make the overshoot as small, as short, and as safe as possible - and bring temperatures back below 1.5C before the end of the century."" He said it could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions of people to un-livable conditions, and amplify threats to peace and security. ""Every fraction of a degree means more hunger, displacement, and loss – especially for those least responsible. This is moral failure – and deadly negligence,"" he said. Watch: Guterres says political courage is needed to transition to clean energy He said the United Nations will not give up on the 1.5 degrees goal and that we have never been better equipped to fight back. He spoke about the clean energy revolution with solar and wind, now the cheapest sources of power, and the fastest growing sources of electricity in history. In 2024, investors poured 2 trillion US dollars into clean energy – 800 billion more than fossil fuels. ""Clean energy is winning on price, performance, and potential – offering the solutions to transform our economies and protect our populations. What's still missing is political courage"", he said. ""Fossil fuels still command vast subsidies – taxpayers’ money. Too many corporations are making record profits from climate devastation – with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress. Too many leaders remain captive to these entrenched interests. Too many countries are starved of the resources to adapt – and locked out of the clean energy transition,"" he added. In an update to its annual state of the climate report timed to coincide with the start of the UN Cop30 talks in Brazil, the WMO highlighted that ocean heat continued to rise in 2025 above the record levels seen in 2024, with impacts including damage to natural systems, intensifying storms, accelerating sea ice loss and sea level rises. Long term rates of sea level rise have doubled, and 2024 set a new record for annual global average sea levels, though it has dropped slightly since 2025 in what the experts said is likely temporary behaviour. The WMO highlighted too that Arctic sea ice was at its lowest levels on record for the time of year after the winter freeze, while Antarctic sea ice was the third lowest on record for its annual minimum and maximum extents. Concentrations of three key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, were at record highs in 2024 and measurements from individual locations suggest they will be even higher in 2025. In response to the report, Gareth Redmond-King, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think tank said: ""Nations are gathering for the start of the COP30 climate summit at the end of a year that has seen devastating hurricanes, wildfires and flooding across the world; here at home, we've seen the second worst harvest as a result of climate change."" He said that news that 2025 was set to be the second or third hottest on record, alongside warnings that current pledges of climate action still put the world on track for dangerous levels of temperature rise ""should focus leaders' minds"". ""Net zero emissions is the only solution we have to halt climate change, to limit the worsening danger and rising costs which this represents, and bring the climate system back into balance."" Lula warns world leaders of 'extremist forces' lying about climate President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of COP30 host Brazil said that ""extremist forces"" were condemning future generations to life on a planet forever altered by global warming. Mr Lula lashed out at ""extremist forces (that) fabricate fake news ... to obtain electoral gains and imprison future generations,"" as he warned that the window to prevent calamitous climate change was ""closing rapidly"". Mr Lula pointed to a recent UN report that found Earth will likely be 2.5C warmer by 2100 from pre-industrial levels. This would claim an estimated 250,000 lives per year and shrink global GDP by almost a third, he told dozens of leaders gathered in Belem. ""Now is the moment ... to face reality and decide if we will have the courage and the necessary determination to transform things,"" the president urged. But he pointed to a tendency of ""selfish immediate interests"" prevailing over the long-term common good. Global climate efforts have been tarnished by ""insecurity and mutual mistrust,"" said Mr Lula, who has been involved in a heated tariff spat with counterpart Donald Trump of the United States, which was absent from the high-level climate talks. Brazil president launches forest fund at climate summit Mr Lula launched a fund today to protect the world's forests, key absorbers of planet-warming carbon. In what Mr Lula dubbed ""one of the main tangible outcomes"" expected from the gathering, the so-called Tropical Forest Forever Facility is meant to gather investments of $125bn from governments and private investors in the long term, with startup funding of $10bn that has not yet been received. ""When forest destruction reaches irreversible points, its effects will be felt across the world. Forests are worth more standing than cut down. They should be part of the GDP of our countries,"" said Mr Lula.

"China's exports fell in October for the first time in eight months, official data showed today, as trade tensions flared in the weeks before Chinese President Xi Jinping met US counterpart Donald Trump. Shipments dropped 1.1% year on year, missing a Bloomberg forecast of a 2.9% rise. Imports in the same month rose 1%, China's General Administration of Customs said. That was also well off September's reading and short of the 2.7% climb estimated in the Bloomberg forecast. China and the US reached a detente in their trade war after Xi and Trump met in South Korea at the end of October. That put a precarious pause on months of tit-for-tat measures between the economic and technological powerhouses as the leaders agreed to suspend a raft of measures for a year. Beijing last month announced fresh restrictions on exports of rare earth technologies, a sector it dominates and is critical to defence and auto manufacturers. Trump retaliated by threatening an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods. However, that warning was called off after Xi and Trump met last month in South Korea, with the US leader calling their first encounter since 2019 a ""great success"". Washington halved a blanket tariff on Chinese goods to 10%, while Beijing loosened restrictions on rare earth exports of rare earths, also providing relief to European businesses. China also lifted extra tariffs on US agricultural products including soybeans, critical to American farmers who are a key part of Trump's base. China's imports from the United States fell 11.6% month-on-month in October, the customs data showed, while its shipments in the other direction rose 1.8%. Chinese exporters had been ""frontloading their trade in order to avoid high tariffs in the US"", Zhiwei Zhang, economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note. The country's shipments to the US jumped by 8.6% in September from August after falling by 11.8% from July. ""It seems the frontloading finally faded in October. As the trade war is put on hold for one year, exports will likely normalise,"" Zhang said. ""Now that export momentum weakens, China needs to rely more on domestic demand,"" he warned",centre
"South Korean car giant Hyundai Motor Group has pledged today an unprecedented $85.8 billion investment in the country over the next five years, a move that comes on the heels of Seoul's trade deal with Washington. Hyundai called it ""the company's largest-ever domestic investment commitment"". ""A significant portion of the investment will focus on new businesses based on advanced AI technologies, such as robotics, contributing to the development of Korea's AI and Robotics innovation ecosystem,"" the company said in a press release. The roadmap ""highlights the Group's agility in actively responding to the rapidly changing global business environment"", it added. Around 40% of the total spending will go into developing ""AI, software defined vehicles (SDVs), electrification, robotics, and hydrogen"", the company said. It added that the investment would help boost exports of South Korea-made vehicles by 13% to 2.47 million units by 2030. The announcement follows a similar pledge by Samsung Group, another major conglomerate whose flagship firm is Samsung Electronics, which vowed to invest $310 billion over the same time, largely in artificial intelligence technologies. Samsung Electronics is already one of the world's top memory-chip makers, providing crucial components for the AI industry and the infrastructure it relies on. Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Kia, sold more than 7.2 million vehicles last year in South Korea and overseas combined. The investment commitments follow Seoul's conclusion of a new trade deal with Washington, under which South Korean exports, including Hyundai vehicles, will face a reduced tariff rate of 15%, down from 25%. But the new rate still remains significantly higher than the previous 2.5% applied under an existing free trade pact.",centre
"US presses Europe on rules for big tech companies - Published Europe should ""reconsider"" its rules for big tech companies if it wants to see lower US tariff rates on its steel and aluminium exports, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said. His comments come as officials from the US and European Union are meeting in Brussels to discuss the status of the trade framework that the two sides agreed in July. That deal set US tariff rates on European products at 15%, lower than had been threatened, in exchange for promises of European investment and changes that would allow in more American agricultural products. But the two sides remain at odds over some parts of the deal. European officials hoped they would secure relief for their metals exports as part of the deal reached over the summer, but the US is still charging at 50% duty - and has expanded the number of products subject to the levy. Europe is also hoping to win carve-outs from tariffs for items such as wine, cheese and pasta, similar to the rollback the Trump administration recently granted for tropical fruit and coffee. In an update to reporters on the talks, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the US wanted to see Europe follow through on promises to lower tariffs on American goods before it would grant exemptions. He and Mr Lutnick said the US wanted to see concessions over European rules for tech companies in exchange for changes to metals tariffs. ""They would like to have steel and aluminium as part of this package and we think it is very, very important that they understand our digital companies and they reconsider their digital regulations to be more inviting to our big companies,"" Mr Lutnick said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. The US has long maintained that taxes on digital services - which typically charge levies on revenue from streaming or digital advertising companies above a certain size - unfairly target American firms. US firms have also been unhappy with Europe's Digital Markets Act, which came into force last year. It was aimed at boosting competition, for example setting rules that would require a company like Apple to make its iPhones work with devices such as headphones made by other brands. When Trump was re-elected last year, many tech firms hoped he would champion a fight over the rules and taxes, unlike the Biden administration, which was seen as leaving such battles up to the firms involved. European officials have previously said that its digital rules were not up for negotiation. European Trade Commissioner MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU had maintained that stance when the issue arose on Monday. ""This is not discriminatory. It is not aimed at American companies,"" he added.",centre
"Sony has today raised its operating profit forecast for the year ending March 2026 by 8% to 1.43 trillion yen ($9.5 billion), citing a smaller-than-expected impact from US tariffs and the strength of its entertainment and chips businesses. Operating profit in the July-September quarter climbed 10% to 429 billion yen after its music unit, which includes anime, and chips businesses recorded higher sales. Sony cited the success of animated movie ""Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle"" as a contributor. The Japanese conglomerate was once best known for household electronics but has become an entertainment powerhouse and is banking on the growth of anime. Profit at Sony's games business fell in the second quarter as the company booked impairment losses related to the ""Destiny 2"" video game. User engagement has not met the expectations Sony had when it bought Bungie, a studio, Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao said at a briefing. Sony sold 3.9 million units of its PlayStation 5, which launched in 2020, during the quarter in a slight increase from the same time a year earlier. ""We plan to expand the install base during the year-end sales season while continuing to balance that expansion with the profitability of the entire segment,"" Tao said. Take-Two Interactive said last week it has delayed the release of ""Grand Theft Auto VI"" for a second time to November next year. The highly anticipated title is expected to boost Sony's PlayStation business as customers upgrade their consoles or buy specialised gaming hardware for the first time. Sony said it has sold 3.3 million units of ""Ghost of Yotei"", which launched last month and has been well received. Nintendo last week hiked its annual sales forecast for the Switch 2 to 19 million units as consumers flock to the gaming device which launched in June. Sony, a leading manufacturer of image sensors used in smartphones, cited sales of larger sensors as boosting its chips unit during the quarter. Customers may have brought forward purchases due to tariffs and other factors, Sony said. Sony said it sees a 50 billion yen hit from tariffs during the financial year, compared to the 70 billion yen impact estimate in August. The company said it would buy back up to 35 million shares for some 100 billion yen. Sony's shares closed up 5.5% following the earnings release.",centre
"US Supreme Court justices has raised doubts over the legality of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs in a case with implications for the global economy that marks a major test of Mr Trump's powers. Both conservative and liberal justices sharply questioned the lawyer representing Mr Trump's administration about whether the president had intruded on the power of Congress in imposing tariffs under a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. But some of the conservative justices also signaled that they were wrestling with their recognition of the inherent power that presidents have in dealing with foreign countries, suggesting the court could be sharply divided in the outcome of the case. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority. During arguments lasting more than two-and-a-half hours, the justices asked US Solicitor General D. John Sauer whether Mr Trump's application of this statute to impose tariffs of unlimited duration was a major action by the executive branch that would require clear congressional authorisation. Those questions related to the Supreme Court's ""major questions"" doctrine, which requires executive branch actions of vast economic and political significance to be clearly authorised by US lawmakers. The arguments came in appeals pursued by the administration after lower courts ruled that his unprecedented use of the law at issue to impose the tariffs exceeded his authority. Businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 US states, most of them Democratic-led, challenged the tariffs. The tariffs - taxes on imported goods - could add up to trillions of dollars for the United States over the next decade. Mr Trump has heaped pressure on the Supreme Court to preserve tariffs that he has leveraged as a key economic and foreign policy tool. Some of the conservative justices also asked pointed questions to the two lawyers arguing against the tariffs. Neal Katyal, representing businesses, and Benjamin Gutman, representing Oregon, one of the states involved in the case. Mr Sauer kicked off the arguments by defending the legal rationale employed by the president but immediately faced questions raising skepticism over the administration's arguments about the language and purpose of the statute at issue. Mr Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose the tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. The law allows a president to regulate commerce in a national emergency. 'Ruthless trade retaliation' Mr Sauer said Mr Trump determined that US trade deficits have brought the nation to the brink of an economic and national security catastrophe. Mr Sauer said imposition of the tariffs has helped Mr Trump negotiate trade deals, and unwinding those agreements ""would expose us to ruthless trade retaliation by far more aggressive countries and drive America from strength to failure with ruinous economic and national security consequences"". The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs. The administration has argued that IEEPA allows tariffs by authorising the president to ""regulate"" imports to address emergencies. The imposition of taxes on Americans ""has always been the core power of Congress,"" conservative Chief Justice John Roberts told Mr Sauer, adding that these tariffs seem to be raising revenue, which the Constitution contemplates as a role for Congress. Mr Trump invoked IEEPA in slapping tariffs on goods imported from individual countries to address what he called a national emergency related to US trade deficits, as well as in February as economic leverage on China, Canada and Mexico to curb the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned Mr Sauer about his argument that IEEPA's language granting presidents emergency power to ""regulate importation"" encompasses tariffs. ""Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase together 'regulate importation' has been used to confer tariff imposing authority?"" Ms Barrett asked. Mr Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, one of the many ways he has aggressively pushed the boundaries of executive authority since he returned to office in areas as varied as his crackdown on immigration, the firing of federal agency officials and domestic military deployments. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the lead-up to the arguments that if the Supreme Court rules against Mr Trump's use of IEEPA, his tariffs are expected to remain in place because the administration would switch to other legal authorities to underpin them. In fact, conservative Justice Samuel Alito asked about a different statute that has gotten less attention, known as Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, could provide an alternate basis for Mr Trump's tariffs. He has imposed some additional tariffs invoking other laws. Those are not at issue in this case. Mr Trump instigated a global trade war when he returned to the presidency in January, alienating trading partners, increasing volatility in financial markets and fueling global economic uncertainty. Mr Trump has wielded tariffs to extract concessions and renegotiate trade deals, and as a cudgel to punish countries that draw his ire on non-trade political matters.",centre
"British bootmaker Dr Martens said today its drive to scale back discounts in the US and shift production from China would help to offset the impact of trade tariffs in the coming years. The company, known for its chunky lace-up boots, has been pulling back on discounts and expanding into shoes, sandals, and bags under CEO Ije Nwokorie as it aims to return to profit growth this financial year. Dr Martens said it expected to manage around half of its tariff-related costs - forecast in the high-single-digit millions of pounds this financial year - and absorb all costs by the next fiscal year via pricing adjustments in the US and flexible product sourcing. The company has shifted its supply chain away from China, which previously accounted for 50% of its production, to Vietnam and Laos, which are subject to lower US import tariffs. The update comes amid cooling British consumer spending as shoppers await Black Friday deals and the government's budget announcement next week. ""While the marketplace remains uncertain and consumers are cautious, and our biggest trading weeks are ahead, we are confident in our plans for the year,"" said Nwokorie. Dr Martens reported an adjusted pretax loss of £9.2m for the six months to September 28, compared with a £16.6m loss a year earlier. The company also maintained its fiscal 2026 forecast. Its shares were volatile in early deals, rising as much as 3.8% before trading about 4% lower this morning.",centre
"US and UK agree zero tariffs deal on pharmaceuticals - Published The UK and the US have agreed a deal to keep tariffs on UK pharmaceutical shipments into America at zero. Under the agreement the UK will pay more for medicines through the NHS in return for a guarantee that US import taxes on pharmaceuticals made in the UK will remain at zero for three years. This is the first time the amount that the NHS pays for medicines is due to increase in more than 20 years. The deal comes after US President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs to as high as 100% on branded drug imports, one of the UK's biggest exports to the US. Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said the deal ""guarantees that UK pharmaceutical exports â worth at least Â£5bn a year - will enter the US tariff free, protecting jobs, boosting investment and paving the way for the UK to become a global hub for life sciences."" The UK exported Â£11.1bn worth of medicines to the US in the 12 months to the end of September, making up 17.4% of all goods exports in that period, according to the Department for Business and Trade. Pharmaceuticals were not included in the wave of tariffs US President Donald Trump had announced earlier this year. But he has repeatedly threatened to raise tariffs on medicines, citing concerns about America's reliance on medicines made overseas and a desire to increase manufacturing in the US. He has also argued that US consumers effectively subsidise medicines for other developed countries by paying premium prices for those drugs and pushed for other countries to pay more. Under the terms set out on Monday, the UK will increase the price threshold, at which it deems new treatments to be too expensive, by 25%. The UK will also increase the overall amount the NHS spends on medicines, with a target to increase that spending from 0.3% of GDP to 0.6% of GDP over the next 10 years. The amount drug companies must pay back to the NHS to ensure the health system does not overspend its allocated budget will be capped at 15% - last year, drug companies had to pay back more than 20%. In exchange, UK medicine exports will be protected from tariff increases for the next three years. White House spokesman Kush Desai said the agreement with the UK was a ""historic step towards ensuring that other developed countries finally pay their fair share"". The pressure from the US had intensified a long-running row in the UK between the government and the pharmaceuticals industry over drug approvals and the cost of medicines to the NHS. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in August that he was not prepared to let drug companies ""rip off"" the UK, after talks between the government and pharmaceutical firms over the cost of medicines broke down. But subsequently Science Minister Sir Patrick Vallance told the BBC he accepted that the NHS needed to spend more on medicines after seeing its spending on drugs shrink as a percentage of its budget over the last 10 years. The NHS advisory body NICE said the changes were likely to lead to an extra three to five medicines a year being approved - currently it assesses around 70 a year and approves 90% of them. It is not clear what this will cost the NHS - drugs currently account for around 10% of the health budget. But Sally Gainsbury, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the agreement could lead to an extra Â£3 billion being spent on drugs, which was ""bad news"" given how stretched budgets were. ""The extra cost will need to be fully-funded by the Treasury,"" she said, adding that it would be better to invest extra money into areas such as GP services or tackling the hospital backlog instead of new drugs. In announcing the new agreement, the UK government said it was the only country in the world to have secured a zero percent tariff rate for pharmaceutical shipments. European officials have previously said they believed their drugs exports would be protected by terms agreed over the summer, which would cap tariffs on most goods at 15%. It follows pressure on the government after the cancellation or pause of several large pharma investments in the UK over the last 18 months, as firms shift attention to the US. In mid-September, British pharmaceutical giant GSK pledged to invest $30bn (Â£22bn) in research and manufacturing in the US over the next five years. A week before GSK's US investment announcement, US pharmaceutical company Merck - which is called MSD in Europe â revealed it was scrapping its planned Â£1bn expansion of its UK operations. Shortly after, AstraZeneca also announced it was pausing a planned Â£200m investment in a Cambridge research facility. In July, AstraZeneca said it would invest $50bn on medicine manufacturing and research and development in the US. William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said he was pleased to see that the protections from US tariffs that UK officials had promised earlier this year had been delivered. ""This deal is a real win. It will promote exports, boost investment, and enhance UK competitiveness as a production and innovation base for world-leading medicines and treatments,"" he said. US pharmaceutical company Bristol Myers Squibb said it now anticipated being able to invest more than $500m over the next five years in areas including research, development and manufacturing. ""This agreement is a sign of progress and one that creates an environment conducive to our continued presence in the UK,"" chief executive Chris Boerner said. The White House had launched a formal investigation into pharmaceutical imports and their effect on national security in April, taking the first step towards tariffs. In September in a Truth Social post, Trump threatened to raise tariffs on branded drugs - a small subset of the medicine that the US imports - to 100%, but the White House did not put the plan into effect, citing negotiations with manufacturers. In announcing the agreement on Monday, US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr said Americans ""should not pay the world's highest drug costs for medicines they helped fund"". ""This agreement with the United Kingdom strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to USâUK pharmaceutical trade,"" he said in a statement.

"Irish Farmers' Association President Francie Gorman has said Tánaiste Simon Harris should clarify immediately where Fine Gael stands on the Mercosur trade deal. The banned hormones were detected in shipments that arrived into Europe earlier this month. Authorities in a number of countries have removed affected products from sale, and issued recalls where necessary. EU countries impacted by the situation include Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Slovakia. The United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) is also among the countries affected. Yesterday the IFA said the recalls of Brazilian beef raise questions about controls in Brazil. Speaking today, Mr Gorman said the recall of Brazilian beef by the EU authorities in the last month is a very serious matter for the public health of European citizens. Mr Gorman also said that farmers would be concerned to hear Fine Gael MEP Regina Doherty speak in favour of the deal on RTÉ's Today with David McCullough as ""the official position of the Irish Government has been that it is working to oppose the deal."" He said that ""Regina Doherty made a great play of the work under way on safeguards, but this latest revelation shows they are redundant. ""The so-called safeguards make no reference to public health. The findings of the investigation carried out by the IFA and the Irish Farmers Journal last month bear out the complete lack of controls that exist in the production systems in Brazil. The EU authorities cannot have any faith in the control systems in Brazil. Ignoring this is putting public and consumer health at risk,"" he said. The IFA President said all imports should be stopped and food imports removed from the trade deal. ""In the meantime, there is an obligation on the Fine Gael leader to re-affirm his party’s position as set out in the Programme for Government,"" he concluded. Mercosur deal is not just about beef - Doherty Fine Gael's Dublin MEP Regina Doherty said that the Mercosur deal is not just about beef. Speaking on RTÉ's Today with David McCullough, she said; ""beef is a tiny, tiny part of what is overall potentially a very, very good deal for Ireland. ""There will be 700 million new customers for our pharmaceutical industry, for our machinery industry, for our medical equipment, for dairy, for whiskey. ""There'll be real great opportunities for businesses across the country of Ireland, including our farmers"", she said on the same programme. She said that there are concerns ""that have been ventilated for many, many months and still haven't been satisfied. ""And so, the other thing that I would say is that you'd be forgiven for thinking that beef was only going to come from Brazil when we signed this deal. ""With 260 tonnes of Brazilian beef in the European Union last year and probably the same amount this year. ""What the Mercosur deal will do is, number one, limit the amount of tonnage of beef, so therefore hopefully protecting the market, particularly for those people like Irish farmers, French farmers, Polish farmers, that it's really, really important to because we put so much essence into the quality of our production and our beef. ""But second of all, because of the concerns that farmers have raised, the Commission has come up with new SBS standards and checks to make sure that we're going to strengthen the controls on the ground."" Ms Doherty said the withdrawal this morning of products that are on the shelf is because the SBS checks are working. She explained that the SBS checks do not check every single consignment that leaves a country. ""And that's true of every other country that we do trade with around the world. It's true of Northern Ireland, it's true of the UK, it's true of all of the other third countries that we have. ""And we are already doing business with the countries that we're proposing to do a free trade deal with, which is what so-called Mercosur. ""The new consignments, restrictions, the strengthening of the SBS standards, the safeguards that we're discussing at our committees this week are an attempt by the Commission to reassure farmers who have raised concerns, and rightly so, because it's their income and it's their protection of their livelihoods and the standards that we cherish in Ireland. ""Those new safeguards will provide those extra measures of protection. And if it doesn't work, then there will be penalties. ""And that's not to say we expect it not to work, but as you can see this morning, not everything is infallible but what really is reassuring is that those consignments were identified near immediately and there have been recalled and be taken off our shelves and so we know that those SBS checks are working."" System 'just doesn't work', says Independent Ireland MEP Independent Ireland MEP for Midlands Northwest Ciaran Mullooly said farmers' concerns are down to health and safety and traceability about any beef that may come into this country under the deal, ""particularly from Brazil"". Also speaking on Today with David McCullough, he said that in the past ""we were told left, right, and center of the dangers"" of hormone growth promoters in cattle ""and we dealt with it."" However, he said, those illegal growth promoters are still on sale in Brazil, ""And worse again, the Farmers Journal proved that last week with their survey, worse again, they've got through this great system the European Commission told us about in recent weeks. ""They got through it. They got through the abattoir test in Brazil. They got into Europe. ""And what have we got in the last couple of days? A recall of meat products right across Europe, proving that the system just doesn't work"". He said that the system is supposed to work at abattoir level in Brazil. ""That's what we told by the commission for the last two years. The rigorous tests were talked about, the rigorous concerns at that stage, they didn't work. Mr Mullooly said that ""there's a cultural problem here. They went across 3,000km. ""They went to 14 different shops. They weren't even asked for an identification themselves, a cattle, a card number, a herd number for an animal. ""There's no culture in Brazil of logging the use of antibiotics in animal feed or in animal prescriptions. ""And you know what happens as a result? It goes into the food chain"". He said ""it is undeniable that that has serious implications for all of us down the line, because the overuse of antibiotics is bad news for public health."" He added; ""if we have it in the food chain coming through, it will be disastrous. ""And the problem is for Irish farmers, we can watch the health concerns, and if the politicians say we're not interested, we'll also watch our industry fall apart because our beef trade will suffer. ""The Brazilian farmers just simply don't have the same cost base"". The European Commission is pushing for the ratification of Mercosur, which would create the world's biggest free-trade zone and significantly increase EU exports to Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Mercosur countries would be able to export up to 99,000 tonnes of beef into the EU at a much-reduced tariff rate of 7.5%, as well as 180,000 tonnes of poultry. Several EU member states, notably Ireland and France, are opposed to its ratification, citing the potential to massively distort key agricultural markets. Additional reporting: Aengus Cox",centre
"Global growth is holding up better than expected as an artificial intelligence investment boom helps offset some of the shock from US tariff hikes, the OECD said today, nudging up its outlook for some major economies. The Paris-based organisation warned, however, that global growth was vulnerable to any new outbreak of trade tensions while investor optimism about AI could trigger a stock market correction if expectations are not met. In its Economic Outlook, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast global growth would slow modestly from 3.2% in 2025 to 2.9% in 2026, leaving its forecasts untouched from its last estimates in September. It predicted a rebound to 3.1% in 2027. OECD head Mathias Cormann said the trade shocks triggered by US President Donald Trump's tariff hikes had so far proved relatively mild, but added their costs were likely to rise. ""The full effects of those higher tariffs since the start of the year will become clearer as firms run down the inventoriesthat they built up,"" he told a press conference. Upgraded growth forecasts for 2025, but risks remain The US economy is forecast to grow 2% in 2025, revised up from 1.8% in September, before slowing to 1.7% in 2026 - up from 1.5% predicted in September. AI investment, fiscal support and expected Federal Reserve rate cuts are helping offset the drag from tariffs on imported goods, reduced immigration and federal job cuts, the OECD said. However, it warned that the Trump administration had put US fiscal policy on an unsustainable trajectory with large budget deficits and rising debt that would require a ""significant adjustment"" in the coming years. China's growth is expected to hold steady at 5% in 2025, up from 4.9% in September, before slowing to 4.4% in 2026 - unchanged from September - as fiscal support fades and new US tariffs on goods imported from China bite. The euro zone's 2025 growth forecast was revised up to 1.3% from 1.2%, supported by resilient labour markets and increased public spending in Germany. Growth is expected to moderate to1.2% in 2026 - it was seen at 1% previously - as budget tightening in France and Italy weighs on the outlook. Japan's economy is projected to grow 1.3% in 2025, up from 1.1%, and buoyed by strong corporate earnings and investment, before slowing to 0.9% in 2026. Trade and inflation outlook Global trade growth is expected to moderate from 4.2% in 2025 to 2.3% in 2026 as the full effects of tariffs weigh on investment and consumption. Elevated trade policy uncertainty limits prospects for a recovery. Inflation is projected to gradually return to central bank targets by mid-2027 in most major economies. In the US, inflation is expected to peak in mid-2026 due to tariff pass-through before easing. In China and some emerging markets, inflation is projected to rise modestly as excess production capacity declines. Most major central banks are expected to maintain or lower borrowing costs over the coming year as inflation pressuresease. The Federal Reserve is projected to cut rates slightly by the end of 2026, barring inflation surprises from tariffs.",centre
"5 ways Republicans are breaking with Trump President Trump is facing increasing resistance from Republicans in Congress to certain proposals and parts of his agenda as he nears the end of his first year back in office. Trump remains the unquestioned leader of the Republican Party, and aides have argued that any lawmakers who fall out of line risk facing a primary or losing the president’s support. But that hasn’t stopped GOP lawmakers from criticizing Trump’s actions or rebuffing some of his demands. A handful of Republicans bucked public pressure from the White House earlier this month to sign a discharge petition to force the release of files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. That break with the White House is perhaps a sign of things to come. Here are five other areas where Republicans are breaking with Trump. Foreign policy Trump has spent much of his first year back in office focused on brokering deals abroad to resolve conflicts, but his approach has frustrated different factions of the Republican Party. The White House has touted progress on a peace agreement that could end the fighting in Ukraine nearly four years after Russian forces launched an invasion. But the initial proposal was panned by lawmakers like Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who raised concerns that it was too deferential to Russia and would not yield a lasting peace in Ukraine. “If Administration officials are more concerned with appeasing Putin than securing real peace, then the President ought to find new advisors,” McConnell, who is retiring after next year, said in a fiery statement. Trump’s backers have also been divided over his continued military support for Israel amid its war against Hamas in the Middle East. One of the most outspoken Republicans to take issue with Trump’s handling of Israel has been Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.). The congresswoman, once one of Trump’s most outspoken supporters, has spent weeks criticizing Republican leadership and argued Trump was not focused enough on domestic issues. She announced amid a widening rift with Trump that she would resign from Congress in January. Trump is also facing Republican criticism as he takes an increasingly aggressive posture toward Venezuela. The Pentagon has repositioned assets near Venezuela, raising concerns that the White House is preparing for conflict with the Maduro regime. “If he invades Venezuela or gives more money to Ukraine, his movement will dissolve,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said last week. On Saturday, the House Armed Services Committee said it will probe the administration after The Washington Post reported Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered to leave no survivors in the first strike in Venezuela. “We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” Reps. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said in a statement. Tariff dividend checks The president has in recent weeks floated an idea to use money from tariff revenue to send out $2,000 checks to millions of Americans. Trump has been facing pressure to take action to lower costs for Americans as polling shows public frustration with the high cost of living. One solution from the White House would be to turn money brought in by tariffs into money in Americans’ pockets. One major problem? It would require congressional action, and many Republicans are not on board. “Look, we can’t afford it. I wish we were in a position to return the American public their money, but we’re not,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo last week. Other Republicans have for weeks offered a message similar to the Wisconsin senator’s. Deficit hawks in Congress have argued that any money brought in from tariff revenue should be used to reduce the national debt, which is more than $38 trillion. “The amount of revenue coming in from the tariffs is considered to be substantial at this point and hopefully can be put to a useful purpose, in my view one of which would be repaying the debt,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said earlier this month. Trump’s idea for a tariff dividend has been a recurring one throughout his second term so far. He initially raised the prospect of a “DOGE Dividend,” using money from contracts eliminated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to send cash to Americans. But that idea failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill, as Republicans again argued any savings should be used to lower the debt. Artificial intelligence policy Trump has repeatedly talked about the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and the need for the U.S. to own the issue, and his administration has taken steps to expand the use of AI. Trump last week signed an executive order establishing the “Genesis Mission,” a new effort to create an integrated AI platform that brings together federal datasets, computing resources and AI tools to boost scientific research. The administration earlier this month crafted a draft executive order that would create a task force to challenge state AI laws and block broadband funding for states that implement regulations around the technology. But the president’s push to expand the use of AI has prompted blowback from some conservatives who are wary of the technology. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has been an outspoken critic of technology companies, and he has raised additional concerns about the growing use of AI. Hawley previously called for the repeal of a law that offers legal protections to major tech companies, specifically citing their training of AI models on copyrighted works. Steve Bannon, a former top Trump adviser and influential voice in the MAGA movement, called AI “the most dangerous technology in the history of mankind” on his radio show. “Technology has tremendous upside if properly guided,” Bannon said last week. “But unguided, incredibly dangerous.” Redistricting The White House has pushed Republicans in red states to redraw their congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterms with the goal of adding a few more safe GOP seats to help the party retain the majority. Texas and Missouri delivered on the administration’s wishes, but that hasn’t been the case everywhere. Indiana Republicans in particular have expressed reservations about redistricting, drawing Trump’s ire. Leaders in the Indiana House and Senate announced each chamber would make a final decision in early December on whether to pursue redistricting. Trump welcomed the latest development, and he cautioned Indiana lawmakers against opposing his wishes. “I am glad to hear the Indiana House is stepping up to do the right thing, and I hope the Senate finds the Votes,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “If they do, I will make sure that all of those people supporting me win their Primaries, and go on to Greatness but, if they don’t, I will partner with the incredibly powerful MAGA Grassroots Republicans to elect STRONG Republicans who are ready to do what is needed to protect our Country and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump has also faced some pushback from Republicans at the national level on redistricting, specifically those at risk of losing their seats because of the partisan battle to redraw maps. Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) has been an outspoken critic of the redistricting wars and has introduced legislation that would ban all mid-decade redistricting efforts nationwide. End the filibuster and blue slips Trump has for months expressed frustration with the rules governing the Senate, and he has turned up the pressure on Republican senators to do away with regulations like the filibuster and blue slip policy. As the record-setting government shutdown dragged on, Trump turned to social media to repeatedly urge senators to eliminate the filibuster, which requires legislation to garner 60 votes to pass the chamber. He even made the case to senators in person at a White House breakfast earlier this month. But Trump’s pleas have done little to sway Republicans who view the filibuster as an important tool to protect the rights of the minority party, and who see abandoning the procedure as a risky move. Thune has said his position on keeping the filibuster has not changed. Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) has said he is a “firm no” on eliminating the filibuster. “The filibuster has traditionally been viewed as a very important safeguard. If the shoe was on the other foot, I don’t think our team would like it,” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said earlier this month. Trump has also taken issue with the Senate’s “blue slip” tradition, under which home-state senators can veto District Court judge and U.S. attorney nominees. The president has urged senators to ditch the policy, arguing Democrats have used it to slow down the confirmation of nominees in certain posts. But a change to that policy lacks support as well, with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) pushing back from his perch as head of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Grassley has argued that a nominee who does not have a blue slip returned does not have the votes to get confirmed. “As chairman I set Pres Trump noms up for SUCCESS NOT FAILURE,” Grassley posted on the social platform X in August.

"Japan's economy shrank almost 2% in the three months to September, as a drop in exports in the face of US tariffs resulted in the first contraction in six quarters, government data showed today. Shipments from carmakers in particular plummeted, following a period of hiking exports before tariffs came into effect. Still, as the overall contraction was not as acute as expected, it likely represents a temporary setback rather than the start of a recession, economists said. ""The contraction is largely due to one-time factors such as housing investment"" affected by regulatory change, said economist Kazutaka Maeda at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute. ""Exports also reacted,"" he said. ""Overall, the economy lacks strong underlying momentum, but the trend still points to a gradual recovery over the next year or two."" Economists generally viewed this quarter's GDP figures as having a marginal impact on Bank of Japan thinking when next deciding interest rates versus factors such as inflation. However, an economist close to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi gave the data more weight. Given the contraction, it ""would be misguided for the Bank of Japan to decide to raise interest rates"" in December, Credit Agricole chief Japan economist Takuji Aida, who is on Takaichi's flagship panel tasked with laying out the country's growth strategy, said in a report to clients. Japan's gross domestic product contracted 1.8% in the three months from July to September. That compared with revised growth of 2.3% in the previous three-month period, as well as the 2.5% contraction that economists on average estimated in a Reuters poll. The reading also translated into a quarterly contraction of 0.4% compared to the median estimate of 0.6%. Exports constituted the main drag as the impact of higher US tariffs intensified. Automakers saw shipment volume plunge, reversing earlier front-loaded exports ahead of tariff hikes, though they mostly absorbed tariffs by cutting prices. Net external demand, or exports minus imports, knocked 0.2 of a percentage point off growth, versus a 0.2 point positive contribution in April-June. The US and Japan formalised an agreement in September that implemented a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, compared to an initial 27.5% on cars and 25% for most other goods. Japanese housing investment also weighed on growth as tighter energy-efficiency regulation introduced in April slowed commitments. Private consumption, which accounts for over half of economic output, grew 0.1%, matching a market estimate. That was cooler than the 0.4% of the second quarter, indicating that high food costs increased reluctance to spend. Capital spending, another key driver of private demand-led growth, rose 1.0% in the third quarter, far exceeding a market estimate of 0.3%. ""Private consumption rose for the sixth straight quarter, and capital expenditure increased for the fourth consecutive quarter,"" Minoru Kiuchi, the economic revitalisation minister, said in a statement. ""This reinforces our view that the economy remains on a moderate recovery path,"" he said. Private-sector estimates reflect expectation for growth to rebound in October-December. A poll of 37 economists by the Japan Center for Economic Research projected a 0.6% expansion. The weak GDP data comes as Takaichi's government compiles a stimulus package to help households manage rising living costs. Advisers to Takaichi have cited a likely sharp GDP contraction as a reason for aggressive stimulus measures. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama told reporters over the weekend that proposed economic stimulus would exceed 17 trillion yen ($109.94 billion), media reported.",centre
"AIB has upgraded its forecast for growth in the domestic Irish economy, as the bank said the uncertainty created by the imposition of US tariffs has ""begun to dissipate."" In its latest Economic Outlook Report, AIB said Ireland's economy has proven ""robust"" to global uncertainty and an escalation in trade tariffs. The bank said it has led to a ""stronger than previously expected outlook for the domestic economy."" ""However, geopolitical uncertainty remains high and because of that consumer spending and business investment growth in Ireland are still expected to cool,"" it added. Since its last outlook report, the bank has revised upwards its forecast for modified domestic demand (MDD), which is a better measure of domestic activity in the economy. It now expects MDD, which increased by 2.7% last year, to grow by 3.2% in 2025, 2.5% next year and 2.7% in 2027, amid an ""improved international outlook."" In May, AIB forecast MDD growth slowing to 2.3% this year and to 2% in 2026, before bouncing back to 2.6% in 2027. In terms of employment levels, the bank said the labour market will continue to grow, but it said given the expected easing in economic growth next year, it expects ""a more modest expansion in employment."" Following a 2.7% rise in 2024, AIB has forecasted employment growth slowing to 2.1% in 2025, 1.7% in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027. The bank said further shifts in US trade and economic policy are among the main downside risks to the Irish economy. It said while some indigenous Irish export sectors may now be exposed to higher US tariffs, there have also been some key carve outs below the headline 15% rate for generic pharmaceuticals and aircraft parts in the EU-US trade deal. ""This should mean Ireland’s effective tariff settles below that headline 15% rate,"" according to AIB. ""In terms of upside risks, a further easing in global uncertainty could underpin stronger domestic spending and investment in the coming years,"" it added. Commenting on the report, AIB’s chief economist said the global macro backdrop has ""improved since our last Economic Outlook in May 2025."" David McNamara said the uncertainty created by the dramatic shift in US trade policy in April is still elevated, but he said the EU-US trade deal has also ""brought some predictability for exporters."" ""Amid this volatility, the Irish economy has been robust, but there are some signs of cooling, particularly in the labour market,"" he said. ""For the domestic economy we expect an easing in growth next year, as ongoing uncertainty dampens both consumer spending and business investment growth,"" he added. Mr McNamara said while the risks remain tilted to the downside, ""the Irish economy has shown remarkable resilience to global shocks in recent years, and the economy is set to continue to outperform European peers."" In terms of gross domestic product (GDP), which includes the activity of multinational companies, AIB has also revised upwards its growth forecast. The bank now expects GDP to grow by 9.1% this year, slowing to 3.8% next year, with growth of 3.5% in 2027. AIB said Irish GDP remains ""a volatile gauge of activity, as evidenced by the sharp swings in growth in recent quarters, but the globalised nature of Ireland’s GDP also reveals the impact of tariff front-running in the global economy."" ""In the first half of 2025, GDP grew by an enormous 18% year-on-year, driven almost entirely by activity and exports from Ireland’s multinational sector. ""While this surge in exports is now starting to ebb, there are also signs of structural factors driving the recent growth in Irish manufacturing,"" it added. The bank notes that Ireland has become ""a production hub for the weight-loss drug market, from which a specific hormone derivative product accounted for 56%, by value, of all Irish pharma exports to the US in H1 2025, compared to just 8% in H1 2024."" AIB said the surge in global demand for weight-loss drugs is ""likely to underpin Irish pharma exports in the near term."" It said it highlights ""the increasing importance of a small number of firms for Irish GDP, and the growing reliance of the Exchequer on associated tax receipts.""",centre
"Ireland's gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to grow exceptionally by 10.7% in 2025, mainly due to strong export activity in the first half of the year, the European Commission said in its Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast today. As the frontloading of exports effect unwinds, growth is expected to moderate to 0.2% in 2026, reflecting a technical base effect from 2025 dynamics, before stabilising at 2.9% in 2027, the EU said. Inflation is projected to remain contained, while the labour market is expected to continue expanding, it added. Today's report also said the outlook for public finances is positive but marked by significant risks to corporation tax revenues. Meanwhile, the euro zone economy will grow faster than earlier expected in 2025, the European Commission also forecast today, mainly thanks to a surge in exports in the first half of the year ahead of expected tariff increases. The EU executive arm said gross domestic product in the 20 countries that share the euro currency would grow 1.3% this year, rather than 0.9% as forecast last April, and up from 0.9% growth in 2024. But growth is to slow marginally to 1.2% in 2026, a downward revision of the Commission's own 1.4% forecast from April, before accelerating again to 1.4% growth in 2027. ""Initially fuelled by a surge in exports in anticipation of tariff increases, the steady - albeit modest -growth observed so far highlights the resilience of the EU economy in the face of a challenging external environment,"" the Commission said. ""Inflation is nearing the ECB target, and financing conditions have improved,"" the forecast said. Consumer price growth in the euro zone is to slow to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026 from 2.4% last year, the Commission said. But despite the faster growth, public finances are to deteriorate, with the euro zone aggregated budget deficit rising to 3.2% of GDP this year from 3.1% last year and expanding further to 3.3% in 2026 and 3.4% in 2027. Aggregated euro zone public debt is also to increase, the Commission said, going up to 88.8% of GDP this year from 88.1% in 2024 and then to 89.8% in 2026 and 90.4% in 2027. The budget deficit of the euro zone's biggest economy Germany is to jump to 4% of GDP next year from 3.1% this year and 2.7% in 2024, mainly as a result of higher defence spending. The second biggest euro zone economy France is expected to cut it budget gap to 5.5% of GDP this year from 5.8% in 2024 despite its government crisis, the Commission forecast. The French budget gap is to fall to 4.9% in 2026, it forecast.",centre
"Manufacturing was weak in the US, Europe and Asia's biggest economies in November, business surveys showed today, as subdued domestic demand and tariff uncertainties weighed. The United States, euro zone, China and Japan all saw manufacturing activity contract last month although there were bright spots for Britain and economies in Southeast Asia, which saw growth, purchasing managers' surveys showed. Factory activity contracted for the ninth straight month in the US amid slumping orders and higher prices for inputs. Euro zone manufacturing activity slipped back into contraction territory last month, its purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed, and Germany's dominant manufacturing sector experienced a marked deterioration in business conditions. While weakening demand in the euro zone forced firms to cut jobs at the quickest rate in seven months, in Germany- Europe's largest economy - new orders fell at the fastest rate in 10 months. ""Current conditions remain at best subdued, with output trending down from an already weak level, reflecting the combination of headwinds faced by the manufacturing sector, including tariffs, heightened Chinese competition and general economic uncertainty,"" said Leo Barincou, senior economist at Oxford Economics. ""The persistent industrial slump appears to be putting pressure on headcount, with firms shedding jobs at the fastest pace since April. Meanwhile, weak demand means that firms were unable to transmit the rise in input costs to their selling prices."" In China, the world's largest manufacturer, factory activity slipped back into a slight contraction, a private-sector PMI showed, a day after Beijing's official measure indicated activity falling for the eighth consecutive month, albeit at a slower pace. ""Container throughput at Chinese ports was little changed last month compared to October. To the extent that demand did improve, it didn't do much to support production amid already high inventory levels - the output component dropped to a four-month low,"" said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. ""And while the output price component edged up slightly, it stayed at a low level, pointing to persistent deflationary pressures."" MANUFACTURING PICKS UP IN BRITAIN Among major European economies, France's manufacturing sector contracted further in November as a drop in production and slower demand for goods hit the sector. S&P Global's survey said demand for French goods had continued to weaken in November, extending the current sequence of declining factory orders to three-and-a-half years. Italy's manufacturing sector crept back into growth territory in November, a positive sign for its struggling economy. In Britain, outside the European Union, the manufacturing sector recorded its first increase in activity since September 2024 last month, bolstered by improved domestic demand and less of a slowdown in orders from overseas. Meanwhile, Asia's other manufacturing powerhouses also struggled with sluggish demand in November, extending declines in factory activity, as progress in U.S. trade negotiations failed to translate into a significant recovery in orders. Japan's PMI showed new orders continued to decline, stretching the downturn to two-and-a-half years. Across Asia this year, businesses in major exporting nations have been scrambling to navigate the uncertainty created by US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. While Trump's trade deals with countries like Japan and South Korea and lowered tensions with China have given firms some confidence, many are still adjusting to the new US trade reality. South Korea's factory activity contracted for a second month in November. However, separate data showed Korean exports rose in November for a sixth consecutive month, beating market expectations, as chip sales hit a record on strong technology demand while autos also jumped after a US trade deal. Taiwan's PMI showed factory activity continued to fall, but at a slower pace. Elsewhere in Asia, emerging-market manufacturers remained outperformers with Indonesia and Vietnam both reporting brisk growth in factory activity and Malaysia swinging back to growth.",centre
"Toyota has today raised its full-year profit forecast, as the Japanese automaker bet solid performance outside the US would help it ride out the impact of US President Donald Trump's import tariffs. The world's top-selling carmaker now expects operating profit of 3.4 trillion yen ($22.6 billion) for the financial year to end-March, up 6% from the 3.2 trillion yen it previously forecast. US tariffs have dealt a body blow to an industry already smarting from fierce competition from China's EV makers and a once-in-a-century upheaval brought by the advance of new driving technology. Toyota estimated the tariffs would cost it 1.45 trillion yen in the current financial year. ""North America is facing a very tough situation due to the impact of tariffs,"" Chief Financial Officer Kenta Kon told a results briefing. While conditions ""were not easy"" in other markets such as China, Europe, Asia and Africa, both profitability and sales volume remained ""solid"", he said. For the quarter, operating profit tumbled 27% to 839.6 billion yen, falling short of the 863.1 billion yen average in a survey of eight analysts by LSEG. That marked its second decline in quarterly profits in a row. In a sign of the strain from tariffs, Toyota's North American business swung to a loss of 134 billion yen for the first half of the year, even as demand for its vehicles in the region remained strong, leading to tight inventories. Kon's deputy Takanori Azuma told the briefing that markets such as India were increasingly becoming important to profits and helping offset the battering in the US. A decade ago, Toyota's profit structure was heavily dependent on North America, with nearly half of profits coming from there, Azuma said. ""If tariffs had become an issue under those circumstances, the impact would have been much greater,"" he said. Toyota said last week its worldwide production increased by more than 10% in September and rose for a fourth month in a row, as both sales and output increased in the US, its top market. Toyota shares stayed deep in negative territory on Wednesday, closing down 3.65% compared to a loss of 2.5% in the Nikkei index.",centre
"The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) has said an investigation carried out by the Irish Farmers Journal (IFJ) in Brazil undermines arguments by the European Commission that the EU-Mercosur trade deal should be approved. The IFJ investigation claims to have been able to buy animal antibiotics in Brazil without prescriptions, and hormones which are banned in the EU. The commission is pushing for the ratification of the agreement, which would create the world's biggest free-trade zone and significantly increase EU exports to Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Mercosur countries would be able to export up to 99,000 tonnes of beef into the EU at a much-reduced tariff rate of 7.5%, as well as 180,000 tonnes of poultry. A number of EU member states, notably Ireland and France, are opposed to its ratification, citing the potential to massively distort key agricultural markets. In its report, the IFJ claims its Beef Editor Adam Woods - who recently travelled to Brazil - was able to complete wholesale purchases of animal antibiotics without prescriptions, and that hormones given to animals that are banned in the EU were freely available to buy. The publication said it recorded undercover video footage to document the purchases. The IFA confirmed its Senior Policy Officer Tomás Bourke accompanied Mr Woods and the photo editor of the IFJ on the trip. According to the farming organisation, ""the team were able to walk into over a dozen agri-stores in Brazil and buy any amount of antibiotics without showing any prescription, ID or herd number and were not asked any questions whatsoever about why they needed the products"". IFA President Francie Gorman said that ""having viewed the findings ... the EU Commission cannot stand over what is going on in Brazil from the viewpoint of the use of animal medicines and the lack of traceability"". Mr Gorman said: ""This flies in the face of all EU protocols in the fight against anti-microbial resistance (AMR) in humans."" Mr Gorman also called for the Mercosur deal ""to be stopped"". He added: ""It completely undermines arguments by the EU Commission that the Mercosur trade deal should be approved because there will be an equivalence of standards between the Mercosur countries and the EU."" In September, the European Commission said the same food safety and animal health standards that apply to EU farmers will also apply to South American producers, who will be subject to the same licensing requirements and audits. At the time, the commission also said it would be stepping up import controls by increasing the number of audits and checks in third countries.",centre
"Irish whiskey distillers have renewed their call on the Government and the EU to step up efforts to secure a zero-for-zero trading deal with the US for their products. The call was made as the industry launched a new tourism initiative aimed at attracting more visitors to distilleries around the country. The Irish Whiskey Way is designed to showcase 26 distilleries across the island in the five designated tourist regions, including the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, Ireland’s Ancient East, Dublin and Northern Ireland. It is aimed at promoting Ireland’s food and drinks trails to international and domestic visitors. The Irish Whiskey Way was launched by Minister for Enterprise and Tourism Peter Burke at the Kilbeggan Distillery Experience in Co Westmeath. Mr Burke described it as ""a unique initiative that celebrates one of Ireland’s most iconic exports while showcasing the rich culture, heritage and hospitality that makes our country and this region so special"". ""This journey will not only highlight the craftsmanship behind Irish whiskey but also connect visitors with the vibrant communities, food experiences and stories that define Ireland,"" he said. In the year to June, just over one million people toured Irish whiskey distilleries, a 23% increase in the number of visitors compared to the previous year. It is hoped the new whiskey trail will help to build on those numbers. Chief Executive of Tourism Ireland Alice Mansergh said it will provide a boost to the tourism sector. Ms Mansergh said it will enable visitors to ""experience the 700-year history of whiskey on this island"". ""It's really significant that the distilleries themselves have reported a million visitors over the past year, so we can see that at the moment, tourism is good for whiskey, and whiskey is good for tourism too,"" she said. Director of the Irish Whiskey Association Eoin Ó Catháin said the new initiative was developed by whiskey distilleries ""working together to present a unique food and drink trail to the international and domestic visitor"". Mr Ó Catháin said the importance of cooperation ""has never been greater, this year more than ever, and the value of every euro spent in Ireland has never been more appreciated"". The initiative has been launched against the backdrop of the 15% tariffs on goods being exported from the EU to the US, which is the biggest export market for Irish whiskey. Amid the initial uncertainty over the trade levy, up to 90% of whiskey production here was paused. While for the most part it has resumed, distillers say the levy is putting significant pressure on the sector, as businesses absorb the costs. Mr Ó Catháin said about 45% to 50% of Irish whiskey is exported to the US, ""so that 15% tariff is a tax on that that ultimately the producers must pay"". He said the sector is hopeful because he said there ""seems to be some momentum building this week, discussions are ongoing about maybe a tariff exemption for products like ours."" ""We know that we have strong advocates, both in government in Dublin, and in Brussels, in the European Commission. ""We need to make sure that we're still in the conversation, and that exemptions, when they do come on the table, include the whiskey sector,"" he added. Mr Ó Catháin said the fact that the tariff is there is ""still causing some uncertainty"". ""It is harder to attract investment. I think what we're seeing is that further investment or further expansion in the US market is now being impacted,"" he added. However, Mr Ó Catháin said there are new markets being opened up, as companies diversify. ""We're having great success throughout the EU and throughout emerging markets in Asia and Africa,"" he said. In Brussels on Monday, Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee raised the easing of the trade tariffs on a number of Irish products, including whiskey, at the EU trade council, ahead of talks with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer. Peter Burke said there is ""no doubt it's a very significant challenge for the sector"". ""What we are trying to do is to get those key carve outs. Obviously, drinks is key in terms of tariffs and the viability of it and I know they have a very strong ask for zero-for-zero and it’s one which the government is really trying to work on,"" Mr Burke said. ""We're trying to work on those key sectors, like drinks, like pharma, all those that are so important for the strategic success of our economy,"" he added.

"Gap has beaten Wall Street expectations for third-quarter comparable sales and profit, helped by strong marketing-driven demand for its Old Navy and Banana Republic brand apparel. Shares of the company rose about 5% in extended trading on Wall Street last night. The clothing maker has banked on efforts such as introducing limited-edition products in collaboration with Disney, Netflix's ""Stranger Things"", and Universal's ""Wicked"" to drive sales. Initiatives such as ""Better in Denim"" featuring global girl group Katseye, and campaigns such as ""Feels Like Gap"" and ""Get Loose with Troye Sivan"", helped Gap boost its brand relevance among Gen Z shoppers. Gap last month announced the launch of an affordable beauty and personal care line for this fall in a bid to diversify beyond apparel. The company reiterated its forecast for a US tariff impact on its annual operating margin between 100 and 110 basis points. Gap sources less than 10% of its merchandise from China as of 2024. CEO Richard Dickson had said in May the company expects reliance on China to be less than 3% by the end of 2025. For the third quarter, comparable sales rose 5%, beating expectations of 3.26% growth, according to data compiled by LSEG. Comparable sales for Old Navy and namesake Gap brand rose 6% and 7% respectively, while Banana Republic grew 4%. Meanwhile, comparable sales for Athleta, Gap's athleisure brand, fell 11%, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of decline.

""Athleta continues to be the biggest drag on the company,"" eMarketer analyst Sky Canaves said, adding that there are no indications of concrete progress on the horizon despite plans for a brand reset. Gap's quarterly revenue rose 3% to $3.94 billion, narrowly surpassing expectations of $3.91 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of 62 cents beat expectations of 59 cents.",centre
"European Union ministers are set to urge top US trade officials today to apply more of the July EU-US trade deal, including cutting US tariffs on EU steel and removing them for EU goods such as wine and spirits. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet EU ministers responsible for trade on their first trips to Brussels since taking office. The bloc additionally wants a broader range of its products subject only to low pre-Trump duties. These could include wine and spirits, olives and pasta.

""We need to get back to zero for zero as soon as possible, which we had been since 2017, 2018 and we have thrived, and our cousins in the US and the industry also want to get back to zero for zero,"" he said. ""It's doing nobody any favours to have a tariff on exports to the US at the moment,"" he added. Mr Rigney is currently in Japan as part of an Asian trade trip to develop market diversification.

"The Irish Road Hauliers Association has criticised Dublin Port's plan to significantly raise its charges on goods shipments from next year. The port plans to raise the charge levied on unaccompanied shipping containers by 5%, raising the base price of a 40ft container to €38.33. There will also be a new €15 infrastructure charge - which amounts to an effective 46% increase in the charges levied on a container compared to 2025. ""We feel that these costs are a tariff on companies doing business in Ireland,"" said Ger Hyland, President of the Irish Road Hauliers Association. ""It's going to effect every company that's getting freight in and out of Ireland."" We need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences Dublin Port has said the higher charges and new levy are required to support the next phase of its €2 billion Masterplan 2040. That aims to double capacity at the port over the next 15 years. Outlining the rationale for its new charging structure, the Dublin Port Company said the port is currently running at close to capacity, making such a large-scale investment necessary. As the port is self-funding, it said, it is required to raise charges to cover the cost. The port company also said that this significant increase in charges comes on the back of two decades of relatively small change. It said charges had been flat between 2004 and 2021, with more modest increases introduced in recent years. ""However this was also in the context of a smaller capital programme,"" its charges update said. ""For context, the average annual capital spend between 2015 and 2024 was c.€65m with the same figure for 2025-2030 envisaged to be c.€170m – an increase of c.160%."" Mr Hyland agreed that investment was needed to ensure the port's capacity could keep up with demand, however he said there should be a different approach taken in funding that. ""The traffic throughput through Dublin Port over those two decades has been enormous,"" he said. ""So they've got their price increases in the upturn in freight that has come in and out of this country. ""There is also synergies there where there can be money saved."" He also said that the higher cost of shipping would inevitably be passed on to consumers. ""It's going to be seen in every shopping basket and every shopping trolley in Ireland,"" Mr Hyland said. ""Every euro that hits the shopping trolley at the present time is an attack on the consumer. ""Our hauliers and our logistics people, the container companies, they can't take this charge so it effectively has to be passed on."" According to Dublin Port, the new charges will mean a €16.83 increase in the cost of an unaccompanied shipping container, with an accompanied container costing €15.70 more. The Central Statistics Office estimates that the average shipping container coming through the port contains €100,000 worth of goods.",centre
"Dutch medical technology company Philips has today reported third-quarter profit above market expectations, helped by measures to mitigate the impact of tariffs and the launch of artificial intelligence tools. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) came in at €531m, surpassing the €484m expected by analysts. Its sales grew 3%, matching analysts expectations at €4.3 billion, driven by a strong performance in North America. Philips, which makes most of its revenue in the US, flagged a lower-than expected impact from US tariffs. CEO Roy Jakobs said in a call with reporters that the performance reflected investments in its supply chain to mitigate tariff impacts in the US and China. ""At the same time, we keep advocating that actually every dollar, euro, RMB spent on tariffs is not spent on patients. And actually healthcare is under enough pressure that they don't need additional pressure from tariffs,"" he added. Jakobs brushed off concerns regarding Nexperia, saying Philips does not use their chips. The chipmaker sparked Netherlands-China tensions when the Dutch government seized control in September. Philips today also reiterated its full year sales and earnings guidance. Philips is racing to develop AI-powered medical tools in patient monitoring, scanner and imagery, and diagnosis assistance. From January to September of this year, Philips spent €1.23 billion on R&D. Jakobs said that all its recent products featured AI and the company develops its own medical-tailored models using patient and customer data.",centre
