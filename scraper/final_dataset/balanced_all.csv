"Central Bank officials warned on Monday that there could be a knock-on effect to the Irish economy in the event of a stock market shock, as valuations of US technology stocks show signs of being “stretched”. A valuation model developed by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller puts stocks in the US S&P 500 index as trading at about 40 times earnings, adjusted for inflation – the second-highest level ever, trailing only the dot-com peak in 2000. Mark Cassidy, director of financial stability at the Central Bank, noted that the 10 largest US companies – including Amazon, Meta, Apple and Nvidia – have accounted for 45 per cent of gains of the wider S&P 500 since April, as the market has surged to all-time highs – despite high levels of macroeconomic uncertainty. Most of the tech groups have major operations and are significant employers in Ireland. Irish business grandee Gary McGann on working with Michael Smurfit, the fall of Anglo Irish and the current state of the Irish economy This week on Inside Business host Ciarán Hancock is joined in studio by Gary McGann, a grandee of Irish business whose many roles included being chief executive of drinks group Gilbeys, Aer Lingus and packaging group Smurfit. Born and raised in Dublin, Gary actually began his career in the civil service, with the Comptroller & Auditor General. He studied at night to become an accountant and later moved into the private sector, rising up the ranks and moving around to eventually become CEO of Smurfit in 2002.He has also had a busy career as a non-executive director, including roles with Anglo Irish Bank at the time of its collapse, and with bakery goods group Arytza, at a challenging time for that business. We covered a lot of ground in this interview. You’ll hear Gary talk about his childhood, his time in school and a couple of false starts in university. We also take a deep dive into his business careers, the highs and the lows. And he gives Ciarán his perspective on the current state of the Irish economy, and what we could be doing better. Along with some tips for young business leaders starting out in their careers. Produced by John Casey with JJ Vernon on sound. However, Cassidy said at the launch of the authority’s second financial stability review of the year that the domestic Irish economy faces greater direct exposure to international tariffs on trade. READ MORE “Both would impact directly upon Ireland. But it is a trade and FDI (foreign direct investment) shock, anything further in relation to tariffs, [that] would affect us most directly here,” Mr Cassidy said. “We are somewhat less exposed directly to financial market shocks, but inevitably they would also spill over.” The pricing of artificial intelligence-related (AI) stocks is reliant on ongoing favourable projections for earnings growth, the report said. A substantial shift in investor risk appetite, major negative developments in the business models of AI-related companies, or a series of correlated macroeconomic or financial shocks could lead to a significant market correction, it warned. The International Monetary Fund, Bank of England, and members of the European Central Bank governing council have warned in the past month about market valuation risks, while the heads of Wall Street beasts Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have predicted that equities could fall 10-20 per cent. The Central Bank report also warned that market interest rates attached to corporate bonds are also at multiyear lows, relative to low-risk sovereign bonds, and “appear disconnected from the uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment”. It noted that the bankruptcies in recent months of US car-loan specialist Tricolor Holdings and car-parts supplier First Brands Group are “warning signs” have led to heightened concerns over lending standards in the international private credit market. When asked about the potential impact on the European economy from US tariffs, Central Bank governor Gabriel Makhlouf indicated that he was more concerned about tariffs and trade barriers on the EU single market. A landmark report on EU competitiveness last year, written by former ECB president Mario Draghi, found that Europe’s existing internal barriers act as a de facto 44 per cent tariff on average goods and a 100 per cent tariff for services. “We should be spending less time worrying about tariffs from the United States and thinking more about the tariffs that are effectively imposed within the single market,” Mr Makhlouf said, adding that more time should be spent trying to dismantle the internal EU obstacles.",left
"Late in a player’s career, there comes a game that sharpens the focus like no other, where you exist in a bubble of “now”. For me, that moment arrived in November, 2013, while preparing to face New Zealand. I was running out of road. At 33, World Cup selection was far from guaranteed and Ireland were unlikely to cross paths with the All Blacks again unless we reached the final. It sharpened me in a way youth never could. Throughout my career, I had moments, largely outside of my control, that provided perspective and acted as a catalyst. I wrote recently about the power of feedback and mental resilience, which is something every young player should embrace. However, when your physical mortality as a player appears on the horizon, smart players recognise it and allow it to set them free, while the rest waste years worrying about the end. So, when I was handed media duty the week of the All Blacks Test, the normal polite nods and soft edges were gone. READ MORE I was clipped, focused and unwilling to waste time entertaining questions that did not matter. I was present in a way you only become when you know a window is closing. Mindset, when attuned to a task correctly, can be a very powerful driver for a player. Joe Schmidt was beginning to look for alternatives in the centre and had a young Robbie Henshaw on the bench. Luke Marshall was also emerging and had started against Australia. There was no future to protect – only the present, whatever that would entail. It can be empowering for those that embrace the challenge. Some do not, trying to deny time and cling to the idea that nothing has changed. Rugby drifts away from them before they realise what has slipped. I couldn’t help but think of that feeling as I watched Stuart McCloskey last weekend. McCloskey has lived his Test career in the shadow of three outstanding centres. Another time and place and he’d have accumulated 50 caps. Sometimes a player’s ceiling rests at provincial level, where club form never translates to the Test arena. On other occasions, access to the international pathway is blocked by high-grade talent. Are Ireland sliding down rugby's global pecking order? Every time McCloskey has been called upon, he has done well. However, I’ve always felt there was more needed from him at this level to displace the competition. This time felt different. He was selected on merit, plain and simple, even with a pride of Lions from which Farrell had to choose. The 33-year-old played with a hint of that late-career honesty and an edge, both physically and mentally. He had that willingness to carry, to take contact for the team, looking to free others with an offload. It looked like acceptance – and acceptance can be liberating. An untimely groin injury means he won’t play against Japan, but if he stays fit and maintains that abrasiveness, it will be hard to push him aside on his return. He gives Ireland something they need: a directness, a selflessness with an offloading threat that can provide a point of difference. This could yet be the richest chapter of his career. Ireland struggled to break down New Zealand. On the face of it, they were on par in possession and territory, but the All Blacks led the field in metres carried, post-contact carries and line breaks. The game is now asking players and teams for a little bit more imagination with the ball in hand and we didn’t find enough of it in attack. It wasn’t a collapse per se, but Ireland operate off thin margins to be successful, where the collective effort is supplemented by moments of individual brilliance: a Tadhg Beirne turnover, a masterclass from Jamison Gibson-Park, or a Dan Sheehan try, all built on a strong team platform. When we don’t have those individual high points, or the team basics are out of whack, the limitations within the Irish system are laid bare. Ireland went with a clear plan of how to win, a little rigid in approach perhaps, but for three quarters of the game it sufficed to give them a winning position, even managing to absorb Beirne’s red card. However, there was a tariff to play for a misfiring lineout, some poor punting and no line breaks. The crowd sensed it. Kicks that once felt like clever pressure began to feel like the surrendering of opportunity. With players like James Lowe, Jamie Osborne and McCloskey in the backline, you want to see moments where the ball is kept in hand and defenders are forced to make decisions. New Zealand may have built their game around structure for the last few years, but the current group are rediscovering that attacking instinct. The individual threats with ball in hand were clear. Leicester Fainga’anuku made a huge impact from the bench, responsible for the break that led to the Ardie Savea try. Beauden Barrett drew Garry Ringrose, his pass beautifully timed to open a gap for Damian McKenzie. New Zealand’s creativity and support play sliced and diced Ireland in that final quarter. There is a lesson there for Andy Farrell’s squad: find new faces to be creative or adopt a more adventurous approach from the collective. It has to be nuanced – not flinging passes for the sake of it, but moving the ball from the point of contact, everyone thinking about space and actively looking for it. Too often, Ireland were narrow in orientation. Even so, it’s far from gloom and doom. As my buddy Felipe Contepomi, head coach of Argentina, says: “If the decision is right, then we can work on the execution.” Think Crowley’s cross-kick, for example. The Japan match is an opportunity to respond to the naysayers. Eddie Jones will try to flood the defensive line and force Ireland to kick. The visitors will be a team with a plan. The Australian has caused Ireland problems in the past. McCloskey’s display against the All Blacks can inspire. He was selected on form and delivered. It puts everyone on notice and gives Farrell further latitude to trust his instincts when it comes to selection, albeit slightly limited by injury and also the Ireland XV match against Spain in Madrid. Tom Farrell might get a run against Japan. He’s earned a chance and it’s a reward for form. If not now, when? He could be the attacking catalyst for those around him. There needs to be a sense of adventure that translates from selection to the pitch. It’s time to back form over reputation.",left
"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said “no” when asked whether the U.S. was at risk of entering a recession in 2026, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” he’s confident Americans will feel economic relief next year stemming from President Donald Trump’s tariff agenda and trade deals. “I am very, very optimistic on 2026. We have set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy,” Bessent told moderator Kristen Welker. He also said, “We believe health care is going to come down,” adding that the Trump administration would have news on that front this week. The treasury secretary acknowledged that there is some pressure on the economy in certain sectors like housing, responding to comments from National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett earlier this month that “we’re starting to see pockets of the economy that look like they might be in a recession.” “Clearly, housing has been struggling, and interest rate-sensitive sectors have been in a recession,” Bessent said Sunday. He added that the recent government shutdown, which was the longest in history, also squeezed the economy. An NBC News poll earlier this month found that about two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living. Still, the treasury secretary pointed to the GOP’s landmark domestic policy package that Trump signed into law over the summer — the president’s “big, beautiful bill” — and to the Trump’s tariff and trade agenda as signs that 2026 will yield a stronger economy for Americans. “I am very confident about 2026, because what we are going to see is the president has done peace deals, tax deals and trade deals [and] the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill,’” Bessent said, adding that the various components of that legislation are “all kicking in.” In a separate interview on Fox, Hassett also predicted that ""it’s going to be an absolute blockbuster year ahead."" ""The good news for the next year is that the factories are going to be in place, and then people are going to start getting the jobs next to the machines and everything else. And so it really, really is a very, very promising set of data,"" he added. Also Sunday, the treasury secretary published an opinion piece in The Washington Post calling for an end to the Senate filibuster. “It’s time for Republicans to acknowledge that the filibuster no longer serves the country — and to be prepared to end it,” he wrote in the piece, later telling Welker that it was meant “to put the Senate on notice.” “The Democrats haven’t been able to stop President Trump in the courts. They haven’t been able to stop him in the media, so they had to harm the American people — 1.5% hit to GDP,” Bessent said, referencing the recent shutdown. “They don’t care. So I believe that Senate Democrats — if Senate Democrats close the government again, that Senate Republicans should immediately abrogate the filibuster.” Bessent also blasted several Democratic lawmakers who are former military and intelligence officers after they released a video telling current military and intelligence officers that they “must refuse” any illegal orders given by the Trump administration. “What I am confident of is that this was a display of gross, gross negligence,” he said, not answering a question about whether the Trump administration is issuing illegal orders. He added, “There is one commander in chief, and when you step outside of the chain of command and try to create the noise and chaos, that only helps our enemies.” He also spoke about the ongoing peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, voicing support for a 28-point peace deal backed by the U.S. that has drawn concern from Ukrainians, European leaders and a bipartisan group of senators who say the peace proposal favors Russia. “At the end of the day, it’s going to be a decision with the Ukrainians. President Trump is a president of peace,” Bessent said before blasting European leaders who are planning more sanctions on Russia. “The Europeans tell me, ‘Oh, we are doing our 19th sanctions package.’ In my mind ... if you’re going to do something 19 times, you failed,” the treasury secretary said, instead praising Trump’s economic sanctions package on India, which targeted Russian oil. He added that he has not spoken to the president about an alleged timeline for negotiating this peace proposal, including whether Trump is pushing for the deal to be signed by Thanksgiving.",left
"On Wednesday, a rumor began popping up in Washington about a momentous policy change: the White House, it was said, would issue an executive order on Friday that would finally preempt state AI laws, handing over those regulatory powers to the federal government. The minute it leaked online, lawyers and policymakers began to scour every sentence of it. There was a lot about it that seemed politically unfeasible; there was even more that seemed overbroad, possibly illegal. There were a lot of agencies that had suddenly been cut out. David Sacks tried to kill state AI laws — and it blew up in his face A leaked executive order draft reveals the tech billionaire making a power play to become America’s AI policy gatekeeper. A leaked executive order draft reveals the tech billionaire making a power play to become America’s AI policy gatekeeper. But crucially, they noticed how much power would have been handed to a certain South African tech-billionaire-turned-special-government-employee who’d tunneled his way into the West Wing — not Elon Musk, but the other one. In every section of the draft order, President Donald Trump was directing his cabinet secretaries and agency heads to imminently issue reports and guidance on how to punish states with AI laws, within the next 90 days. In the Attorney General’s case, they had 30 days to establish an entire legal task force to sue those states. Every single one of them would have to consult David Sacks, the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto — and one of the most influential tech venture capitalists in the world — while executing the order. “I don’t want to say it was a power grab. That’s too strong of a term,” said a tech policy adviser close to the White House. “But it’s definitely a consolidation, as it were, of his power.” The MAGA universe immediately exploded, with War Room host Steve Bannon — who’d managed to help kill a previous attempt at an AI moratorium in the Senate this year — dedicating part of his Friday show to the draft order. In Congress, Democrats revolted publicly; tech-skeptical Republicans were quietly preparing their statements. The AI policy world immediately issued reports illustrating how much power would have been sucked into the hands of the White House. The order had been scheduled to be signed on Friday — and then it never was. Outside the White House, the AI executive order, had it been signed, would have been legally unenforceable. But inside the White House, it would have been treated as an imperial mandate. Trump’s executive orders are historically designed to force his underlings to get his will done immediately, legality be damned, and the fallout tends to be irreversible by the time that the courts find his actions illegal. His tariff order, for instance, may soon be overturned by the Supreme Court, but not before causing trillions in economic losses and damaging the US’s international relationships. Asked for comment, the White House press office email run by Karoline Leavitt refused to comment on the record, instead only insistently asking us to name our sources. And from there, it would have been used as a threat against the states. “I suspect that if it’s effective, the most effective part of it will be having a chilling effect on state legislation,” Charlie Bullock, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Law and AI, told The Verge. One section of the draft would have allowed the government to pull any federal funding from states in violation of the order — not just rural broadband grants, which had been used as leverage in previous preemption fights, but anything from highway funds to education grants. “Even if [a state] can win a court case to make them give them that funding eventually, it would take a long time. States might be convinced by that.” As such, it would have turned Sacks into the US’s AI policy gatekeeper in one fell swoop. Though there are several White House officials with ties to the tech industry, Sacks, who has a provisional government employment status, is seen by Washington insiders as Trump’s closest conduit with the big-name tech CEOs, who consider him as a peer. (Though Vice President JD Vance did work in Silicon Valley prior to politics, he never did break into the three-comma club.) “He’s trying to maintain America’s competitive edge in the big picture, and you could say, in a more selfish manner, he’s trying to protect the tech industry [with] a more parochial, These are my people approach,” said the tech policy adviser close to the White House. But Sacks was also trying to neutralize a third, internal threat: the political forces within the executive branch, both on the progressive left and hard MAGA right, that were hell-bent on curbing his influence. Even in this hyperpartisan climate, the left and right share a common cause in regulating the excesses of Big Tech, and will even publicly join forces to oppose them. And it apparently takes place behind the scenes, too. As the tech policy adviser described it, the informal internal anti-Sacks alliance consisted of holdovers from the Democratic Biden administration “that were hyper-regulating and wanting to break up tech companies,” and the hard-right MAGA officials in his current administration “who don’t trust tech, and similarly want to regulate technology companies — either on the state level or on the federal level — and kneecap them.” According to those analyzing the bill, it was telling which entities had been completely shut out. The first move, spotted by tech policy experts, was identifying who’d been cut out. In 2023, President Joe Biden’s massive AI executive order empowered a broad swath of agencies to develop AI policy, and most — if not all of them — were suddenly absent. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), for instance, had been delegated to research AI risk management, evaluation, and standards development. (Those concerns, incidentally, were recently encoded in California’s AI safety law — a law that the AI industry has strenuously opposed.) Also missing: any mention of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), which centralizes the administration’s tech policies into one place before being brought to the President; the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the DHS agency that focuses on national security internet threats; or the Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI), the name of which speaks for itself. “Maybe in practice, David Sacks will be consulting them and the [Office of Legislative Affairs] might be communicating with them,” said Riki Parikh, the policy director for the bipartisan Alliance for Secure AI and a former lawyer for the Biden administration. “But it’s surprising to not list them out.” Instead, the proposed moratorium would have been carried out by four agencies: the Department of Justice, which would have sued the states in violation of the order; the Department of Commerce, which would analyze which states could lose their broadband funding; the Federal Trade Commission, which would have investigated which states would be engaged in “deceptive conduct” over ideological bias; and the Federal Communications Commission, which would have developed a federal AI reporting standard. All, naturally, would be advised by Sacks — and all of them now had power to pursue ways to punish states that wrote or enforced AI laws. Populist Republicans, particularly those in the MAGA base, immediately saw how much Sacks had influence throughout the entire order, and how much the order would threaten any state. Though they had briefly aligned with the tech right in getting Trump elected, Republicans increasingly turned on their allies over a complete ideological mismatch: they believe AI is a threat to conservative family values and will steal American jobs, are allergic to federal incursion into states’ sovereignty, and hold a general disdain for how quickly tech CEOs went from supporting Democrats to Trump. Several red states have begun writing their own AI regulations, and governors like Florida’s Ron DeSantis and Arkansas’ Sarah Huckabee Sanders have openly voiced their dissent against a moratorium. Even Trump’s open support of a moratorium hasn’t swayed the base. “Purely just from a political strategy standpoint, the base of the Republican Party is not with David Sacks and [fellow VC and Trump supporter] Marc Andreessen on this. They’re just not,” said Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime Republican strategist and the CEO for the bipartisan Alliance for Secure AI. ”And I don’t think they care because they’re just like, It doesn’t matter to us. We’re here to get what we want and there’s three years remaining in this administration. We were Harris and Biden and Hillary supporters, and then we became Trump supporters because it’s convenient.” Little did the AI world anticipate that MAGA would immediately try to kneecap them, even joining forces with the progressive anti-tech factions in government, and that their aggressive Silicon Valley approach via executive order would have further widened the rift. But it was enough for them to back off temporarily. The following week, a new rumor circulated Washington that the administration would sign an AI-related order, and they did — but for a completely different, non-preemption, very uncontroversial project directing the National Labs to engage more with AI development. The Special Advisor on AI and Crypto was mentioned only once. Update, November 25th: Added comment from the White House press office.",left
"What will happen to home prices in 2026? Here's what experts say buyers should know now. Homebuyers finally got some good news late this year when mortgage rates dropped considerably following the Federal Reserve's back-to-back rate cuts in September and October. With the Fed easing its stance on rates, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell into the low-6% range, a notable improvement from the 7%-plus rates homebuyers faced earlier this year. These lower borrowing costs are helping to reignite interest in the housing market, but the big question now is what happens next. Will improved affordability bring more buyers into the market and push home values higher? Could rising inventory finally give buyers the upper hand? Or will economic uncertainty keep things flat? As 2026 approaches, the direction of home prices is also up in the air, so we spoke with mortgage and real estate professionals to get their predictions about where home prices could head next year. Here's what they had to say. Find out how affordable the right mortgage loan options could be now. What will happen to home prices in 2026? Here's what experts say buyers should know now Steven Glick, director of mortgage sales at Ziffy, an all-in-one AI-powered real estate investment platform, expects flat to mildly positive home appreciation at somewhere between 0.5% and 2%. ""That band reflects two things moving in opposite directions: Rates have eased enough to coax demand back, but affordability is still stretched and supply is slowly rebuilding,"" Glick says. This outlook signals a return to normalcy after years of extremes, according to Debbie Calixto, sales manager at mortgage lender loanDepot. ""We expect moderate price growth in 2026 — likely below 4% on average across the country,"" Calixto says. Karen Mayfield, national head of originations at mortgage-as-a-benefit provider Multiply Mortgage, sees a similar pattern unfolding as lower rates bring buyers and sellers back into the market. However, Mayfield predicts pent-up demand will absorb new home supply. Learn more about the lowest mortgage rates you could qualify for in this market. What could happen in 2026 to cause home prices to rise? Several conditions could push home prices higher in 2026, experts say. Here's what could cause home prices to rise next year: - Mortgage rates drift below 6% and stay there. ""Each quarter-point matters for monthly payments and buyer qualifying power,"" says Glick. ""With the Fed already easing and signaling more to come, a gentle slide in mortgage rates would firm demand."" - The labor market holds steady. ""If employment is stable, more people will come off the fence and buy,"" says Joe Chung, a realtor with Coldwell Banker. When demand improves, prices tend to climb. - Construction costs rise. ""Tariff-driven cost increases will push new home prices higher, creating a floor for existing home values,"" Mayfield says. What could happen in 2026 to cause home prices to fall? On the flip side, experts say a few factors, including the following, could push home prices down next year: - Mortgage rates climb back up. ""An inflation surprise or wider risk premiums would lift the 10-year Treasury and, by extension, 30-year mortgages,"" Glick says. As affordability worsens, fewer buyers can qualify, weakening demand and putting downward pressure on prices. - Housing supply surges unexpectedly. According to Mayfield, a wave of baby boomers downsizing (meaning there are more homesellers) could flood the market with inventory faster than buyers can absorb it. - The economy weakens. Rising unemployment or a broader economic downturn would reduce buyer demand and purchasing power. Chung cautions that the market remains fragile. ""Small shifts tend to 'freak out' confidence, which can soften values nationally,"" Chung says. What could happen in 2026 to cause home prices to stay the same? The most probable path forward requires the following conditions to hold: - Mortgage rates and inventory move in tandem. Glick describes this as a ""push-pull balance,"" where improved affordability adds demand while growing supply adds choice, netting to flat-ish national prices. - Economic conditions stay predictable. Mayfield emphasizes the importance of stability. ""The key is absence of shocks — no rate spikes, no inventory floods and no major policy changes that dramatically alter buyer or seller behavior,"" Mayfield says. - Regional differences average out. Some Sun Belt and pandemic-boom metros continue digesting their 2021 to 2022 price surges. Meanwhile, supply-constrained Northeastern and Midwestern markets hold firm. ""Nationally, that averages out near zero to low-single-digit gains,"" Glick says. The bottom line Experts largely expect home prices to stay stable with modest growth in 2026, but that doesn't mean you should wait to buy. Glick advises locking in if the home and payment work today. ""Rates are already lower than they were earlier in 2025,"" Glick says. ""There's no guarantee 2026 gives you meaningfully lower rates, and even a small price rise or more bidding can offset a minor rate dip."" Calixto agrees, warning that new economic data or Fed policy changes can shift mortgage interest rates quickly. So if the numbers work for you now, it may be wise to move forward. Connect with a real estate agent who knows your target area and speak with several lenders to explore your options. They'll help you understand local market conditions and find a loan structure that fits your goals and timeline.",left
"Associated British Foods (ABF), the food and retail conglomerate the group that owns Penneys and Primark, is exploring a spin-off of its fashion chain and food business as part of a strategic review. The UK-listed group on Tuesday said it was reviewing ownership of both businesses in consultation with its majority shareholder, Wittington Investments, the holding company for the Weston family that has food and retail businesses in North America and Europe. ABF said it was committed to “maintaining majority ownership of both businesses”. Shares in the group, which has a market capitalisation of £16.3 billion (€18.5 billion), were down 2.6 per cent in early trading in London. George Weston, chief executive and third generation of the family shareholders, told the Financial Times that “the financial markets will better understand the food business if Primark were separated into a standalone listed business”. READ MORE “There’s a realistic chance of this happening,” he said. ABF has faced persistent scrutiny over the past decade about whether Primark — which sells T-shirts for £2.50 (€2.84) and jeans for £14 — fits into a portfolio that includes bioethanol, sugar beets, bread, Twinings tea and Tilda rice. [ Penneys owner Primark marks Middle East entry with Kuwait storeOpens in new window ] The company has historically argued that being a family-owned conglomerate helped insulate it from downturns and allowed it to plan for the long term. While Primark has been ABF’s standout business for a number of years, it has struggled in recent years as cash-strapped shoppers rein in spending. The rapid emergence of Shein and Temu, which ship cheap clothes directly from Chinese factories to consumers’ homes, has added to the chain’s challenges. Independent analyst Nick Bubb said “it would be ironic if after all these years ABF decides to separate off Primark just as its performance starts to be badly impacted” by competition from Shein and Temu. Tom O’Brien of Nephin Energy on the importance of gas, the potential of biomethane, and whether our energy bills will come down Mr Weston said any potential split of Primark from the business was “not in response to any trading issues”, adding that the question of Primark’s role within ABF had been regularly reviewed and last considered before the pandemic hit five years ago. The current strategic review had been going on for a “number of weeks”, Weston said, but stressed that a split was “not a done deal” and could take up to two years to complete. ABF’s food business spans groceries, ingredients and agricultural products, and Weston signalled he intended to continue as its head. Examining a split was about effective governance, rather than a need to change strategy, said Weston, adding that “it’s not about the short-term, it’s about the next 20 years”. Several analysts described ABF’s move as “surprise”. “The food businesses are not very well understood as the focus has always been on Primark, and Primark trades on a significant implied discount to other listed fashion retail peers,” said Anubhav Malhotra, an analyst at Panmure Liberum. “The separation of the businesses could help unlock some of this value.” ABF reported on Tuesday that Primark’s full-year revenues rose by 1 per cent to £9.5 billion and operating profits increased by 2 per cent to £1.12 billion. The chain has been steadily expanding in the US over a number of years and now has 33 stores in the country. At a group level, ABF reported a 1 per cent decline in revenues to £19.5 billion. Operating profit fell 23 per cent to £1.5 billion. Earlier this year, speculation about a Primark spin-off intensified after the abrupt departure of the fashion retailer’s long-serving chief executive Paul Marchant in the wake of a misconduct scandal in March. Primark is being run on an interim basis by former Marks and Spencer executive Eoin Tonge, who joined ABF as chief financial officer in 2022. Weston said the appointment of Marchant’s replacement would be influenced by whether ABF decided to split Primark from the group. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025",left
"Toymaker takes tariff fight to Supreme Court: ""I definitely want my money back"" Toymaker Rick Woldenberg made it his mission to challenge President Trump after he imposed sweeping tariffs earlier this year. Now, his fight has landed in the Supreme Court. Maurice DuBois reports.",left
"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs appear to be on shaky legal ground, with Supreme Court justices on Wednesday indicating he may not have the authority to impose them under a law designed for use during a national emergency. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority that has regularly backed Trump on various contentious cases since he took office in January, but based on the almost three-hour oral argument, the tariffs dispute could go the other way. Both conservative and liberal justices asked tough questions of Trump's lawyer, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, though some of the conservatives seemed more sympathetic to his arguments. The consequences are huge for Trump and the economy at large, with Americans increasingly anxious amid signs that the tariffs are contributing to, rather than alleviating, higher costs. A new NBC News poll found that 63% of registered voters believe Trump is failing to live up to expectations on the economy, after he ran on lowering prices, in part, through tariffs. Other recent polls show a majority of Americans oppose the tariffs, which disproportionately burden small businesses. The legal question is whether a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which allows the president to regulate imports when there is an emergency, extends to the power to impose global tariffs of unspecified duration and breadth. The Constitution states that the power to set tariffs is assigned to Congress. IEEPA, which does not specifically mention tariffs, says the president can ""regulate"" imports and exports when he deems there to be an emergency, which occurs when there is an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" to the nation. Until Trump began his second term in January, no president had ever used the law to tariff imports. Lower courts ruled against the Trump administration, with both sides asking the Supreme Court to issue a definitive ruling. During the argument, Chief Justice John Roberts, one of the court's conservatives, noted that “the imposition of taxes on Americans” has always “been the core power of Congress,"" a fact that was echoed by other justices in their questioning. “The statute doesn’t use the word tariff,” Roberts said. Or as liberal Justice Elena Kagan told Sauer: ""It has a lot of actions that can be taken under this statute. It just doesn't have the one you want."" The high-stakes case puts the spotlight on a court that was skeptical of President Joe Biden’s unilateral use of executive power, including his attempt to forgive billions of dollars in student loan debt. The court blocked that proposal, citing what has been called the “major questions doctrine.” Under that theory, embraced by the conservative majority in recent years, a president cannot impose a broad policy with huge impacts on society and the economy unless Congress passes a law that specifically allows for it. Several justices asked questions suggesting the case could be decided along similar lines. ""It seems it might be directly applicable,"" Roberts said, referring to the doctrine. Justice Neil Gorsuch, another conservative, probed whether it was unconstitutional for Congress to give the president sweeping powers over tariffs, as the government suggested. If the court were to rule for Trump, would there be any limit to Congress ""just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce, or for that matter, declare war?"" he asked Sauer. Gorsuch, appearing to reference efforts by Biden to tackle climate change, also wondered if a president could use the law to impose sweeping tariffs on gas-powered cars and other products that emit greenhouse gases. Sauer conceded that it is “very likely” a president could do that under his argument, adding that the current administration would never do such a thing based on Trump's view that climate change is a ""hoax."" Kagan and the court's two other liberals all pushed back on Sauer's arguments. ""You want to say tariffs are not taxes, but that's exactly what they are. They are generating money from American citizens,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said that when Congress enacted the IEEPA it was ""pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers,"" not expand them. Some of the other conservative justices were more sympathetic to Sauer's arguments, with both Justice Amy Coney Barrett and Justice Brett Kavanaugh questioning why IEEPA would allow for broad trade embargoes on other countries but not the less drastic option of tariffs. The law is intended to address an emergency, but if tariffs are not included, ""you're taking away the president's suite of tools,"" Kavanaugh said. Likewise, Barrett said that it would make sense for Congress to authorize ""weaker medicine than completely shutting down trade."" In questioning lawyers for the challengers, Roberts gave a crumb of hope to Trump by noting that while tariffs are a tax that is a core power of Congress to impose, they also relate to foreign policy, which the president has full authority over. Referencing the impact the tariffs have had in helping Trump make deals with other countries, Roberts said they are ""quite effective in achieving a particular objective."" Trump has made clear how important this case is to him and his economic plan, repeatedly warning of drastic consequences if the court strikes down his tariffs. He had even suggested he would go in person to Wednesday's oral arguments, becoming the first president to do so. He later backed off that idea, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick were both present. “If a President was not able to quickly and nimbly use the power of Tariffs, we would be defenseless, leading perhaps even to the ruination of our Nation,” Trump said in a characteristic Truth Social post Sunday. But even if he were to lose at the Supreme Court, Trump has levied other tariffs under different laws that would survive. And his administration has been looking at other ways of imposing tariffs, although those methods are more limited. The court is hearing the case on an expedited basis, meaning a ruling could be issued in short order. It has consolidated two underlying challenges brought by small businesses and a coalition of states. V.O.S. Selections Inc., a wine and spirits importer, Plastic Services and Products, a pipe and fittings company, and two companies that sell educational toys are among the businesses that sued. The challengers said in court papers that the justices do not even need to reach the ""major questions"" question, noting that the text of IEEPA does not grant any power to impose tariffs. They pointed out that other laws, including the Trade Act, specifically grant the president the authority to levy tariffs in some form. Even if Trump could, in theory, use IEEPA for tariffs, there is no emergency that would warrant invoking it now, they added. The cases concern two sets of tariffs. One is country-by-country or “reciprocal” tariffs, which range from 34% for China to a 10% baseline for the rest of the world. The other is a 25% tariff Trump imposed on some goods from Canada, China and Mexico for what the administration said was their failure to curb the flow of fentanyl. Other tariffs implemented using different legal authorities, such as 50% steel and aluminum tariffs on all other worldwide trading partners, are not at issue in the case before the court. As of the end of August, IEEPA tariffs had raised about $89 billion, according to the latest data available from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If the Supreme Court overturns those tariffs, the government would then face demands from businesses that it pay back that revenue.",left
"UK and US agree zero-tariff deal on pharmaceuticals Officials say the U.K. has sealed a deal securing a 0% tariff rate for all U.K. medicines exported to the U.S. for at least 3 years, in return for the U.K. spending more on new medicines LONDON -- The U.K. has sealed a deal securing a 0% tariff rate for all U.K. medicines exported to the U.S. for at least 3 years, officials said Monday, in return for the U.K. spending more on new medicines. Under the deal, announced by officials on both sides, the United States government agreed to exempt U.K.-origin pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical ingredients, and medical technology from import taxes. The Trump administration said that in return, U.K. drugs firms committed to invest more in the U.S. and create more jobs. As part of the deal, the U.K. government said it will invest around 25% more in new and effective treatments — the first major increase in such spending in over two decades. Both sides hailed the deal as a win. “This vital deal will ensure U.K. patients get the cutting-edge medicines they need sooner, and our world-leading UK firms keep developing the treatments that can change lives,” Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said. U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement “strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to U.S.–U.K. pharmaceutical trade.” Earlier this year President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer agreed on a framework for a trade pact that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products, including beef and ethanol.",left

"In today’s newsletter: An end to the shutdown could be in sight after senators clear a key vote for a deal. An Arctic blast leaves more than 105 million Americans under winter weather bulletins. And the Chargers dominated on “Sunday Night Football.” Here’s what to know today. Senators advance tentative deal to end the government shutdown Senators struck an agreement last night, projecting confidence that it will be sufficient to end the lengthy U.S. government shutdown, three sources with direct knowledge of the details told NBC News. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. The agreement, reached by a group of Democrats who teamed up with Republicans, cleared the first hurdle on a vote of 60-40 to advance in a late-night Senate vote. If it’s approved, it would then need to pass the House and gain President Donald Trump’s signature to become law and reopen the government. Even if it has enough support to clear those hurdles, the process is expected to take days. The deal funds the government through Jan. 30, would fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and reverses attempted layoffs of federal workers. But in a major concession from Democrats, it does not include an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Meanwhile, a group of Senate Democrats is pushing for an investigation into the Trump administration’s use of federal agency websites and emails to post partisan messages blaming Democrats and the “radical left” for the shutdown. In a letter obtained by NBC News, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others ask the Government Accountability Office to open a probe into whether the political messages violated federal laws that pertain to ethics and partisan political activity. More shutdown news: - In a reversal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said that states that issued full November SNAP benefits to recipients following a lower court decision should “immediately undo” the distributions and that failure to comply could result in the cancellation of future federal funds. - Thousands of flights were delayed and canceled over the weekend, as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that many will not be able to spend Thanksgiving with their families. - Trump floated directly paying Americans for their health care costs and giving out $2,000 dividends from tariff revenue, ideas that administration officials later said were not formal proposals being sent to the Senate. Arctic blast to bring frigid temperatures to most of the U.S. An Arctic blast dumping snow on the Midwest is expected to eventually cover two-thirds of the nation and bring record cold to the South. The blast broke off from the polar vortex above Canada, sending the cold air south. A list of National Weather Service bulletins shows more than 105 million people are the subject of advisories, watches and warnings on freezing conditions, winter weather and lake effect snow. The cold sweep is forecast to spread across the eastern two-thirds of the nation, and it could bring freezing temperatures to much of the South by Tuesday while setting low temperature records, the weather service said in last night’s national forecast discussion. Afternoon highs in parts of the South were expected to be 10 to 25 degrees below normal. Chargers defeat Steelers 25-10 on 'Sunday Night Football' As AFC teams continue to make their cases for championship contention, the “Sunday Night Football” spotlight fell on the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Los Angeles Chargers. A 25-10 Chargers victory has kept them in the conversation. Meanwhile, questions remain about the Steelers’ offense, and their own readiness to compete with the conference’s best teams. An expected quarterback duel didn’t materialize: Los Angeles quarterback Justin Herbert threw for 220 yards and a score while Pittsburgh’s Aaron Rodgers struggled. The future Hall of Famer had just 161 yards passing with a touchdown and two interceptions. Chargers wideout Keenan Allen hit a new record, passing Hall of Fame tight end Antonio Gates for the most receptions in franchise history, with 956. The Chargers move to 7-3 while the Steelers drop to 5-4. We covered all the action here.

"Ireland’s economy is like a dog simultaneously barking and wagging its tail. The question is which end to believe. While the European Commission is forecasting the economy here will record “exceptional” growth of close to 11 per cent this year, the Central Bank is warning about the country’s unique exposure to a slowdown in global trade on the back of US tariffs. In its latest financial stability review, the regulator also warns about the possible spillover effects on Ireland if the US AI bubble bursts. Economic forecasts here, no matter how positive, always come with caveats, potential banana skins. Being a small, open economy has its occupational hazards. READ MORE This time the leprechaun in the national accounts is exports. They surged between January and May this year as pharmaceutival multinationals front-loaded exports into the US ahead of Donald Trump’s tariff announcement in April. [ Irish economy forecast to grow at eight times euro area averageOpens in new window ] Most of it related to exports by pharma giant Eli Lilly. The company produces the ingredients for its two blockbuster weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound in Ireland. Either way, this has created a bulge in our headline gross domestic product (GDP) metrics. The commission expects Irish GDP to expand by 10.7 per cent this year, eight times the growth it is forecasting for the euro zone as a whole. Irish business grandee Gary McGann on working with Michael Smurfit, the fall of Anglo Irish and the current state of the Irish economy But GDP has become progressively detached from the real economy here because of the tax planning activities of multinationals which use intellectual property assets to declare as much profit as they can in the State. According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ireland’s headline GDP was €562.8 billion last year, nearly 43 per cent bigger than the agency’s measure of modified measure of gross national income (GNI*) which was €321.1 billion. In other words, GDP overstates the size of the Irish economy by about 40 per cent. That 40 per cent disparity is why the real feel in the Irish economy differs so strikingly from the headline growth metrics that surround it. Throw in an aggravated housing crisis and a dysfunctional health service and Ireland’s turbo-charged economic performance can seem illusory. The Economist magazine left Ireland out of its recent country “rich list” – a league table of how GDP levels in different countries compare - because it claimed Ireland’s data was “polluted by tax arbitrage”. In its report, the European Commission notes that as the front-loading effect unwinds, growth here is expected to moderate to just 0.2 per cent in 2026, “reflecting a technical base effect from 2025 dynamics, before stabilising at 2.9 per cent in 2027″. That means we’ll swing from growing at eight times the rate of the euro zone to growing at a fraction of the euro zone rate, all which means precious little to the average worker here with our GDP numbers now mere statistical noise.",left
"Sony is announcing the A7 V, its first camera with a partially stacked sensor and various features borrowed from pricier Alpha models. It will be available body-only in late December for $2,899, and a kit including a new 28-70mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS II lens is coming in February. Sony’s new A7 V uses a partially stacked sensor so you can shoot silently The jack-of-all-trades camera maintains 33 megapixels while inheriting features from other models. The jack-of-all-trades camera maintains 33 megapixels while inheriting features from other models. The A7 V is one of Sony’s most versatile all-purpose full-frame cameras, for enthusiasts and pros not looking to spend nearly $7,000 on an A1 II. The new A7 retains a 33-megapixel sensor like the A7 IV before it, but with a partially stacked design like Nikon’s Z6 III. Thanks to this tech, the A7 V can be used full time with its electronic shutter for totally silent shooting and blackout-free 30fps continuous bursts. While the Nikon Z6 III, as great as it is, had some controversies over its partially stacked sensor’s reduced dynamic range, Sony claims the A7 V’s sensor has 16 stops of latitude. Other features of the A7 V include a new Bionz XR2 processor with a dedicated AI chip for tracking autofocus and subject detection (like the A7R V), a new tilt screen (also first introduced on the A7R V), improved five-axis image stabilization (rated up to 7.5 stops), up to one second of pre-capture in continuous burst shooting, and a speed boost button that allows on-the-fly faster shooting (borrowed from the A9 III). The A7 V’s OLED electronic viewfinder is the same 3.68-million dot resolution as its predecessor, but it now supports a faster 120fps, and the live view feed switches more quickly from the LCD when you put your eye to it. Sony also managed to squeeze a bit more life out of the new model using the same NP-FZ100 battery — rated for an estimated 630 shots using the EVF or 750 with the LCD (an increase of 110 and 170 over last gen). The A7 V is designed as a hybrid for both stills and video, and its video chops have a significant improvement over the A7 IV. The new model records in oversampled 7K resolution to yield 4K 60p full-frame video, fixing one of the A7 IV’s biggest issues and oversights. The last-gen model relied on a 1.5x crop for its 4K 60p footage, whereas the A7 V now crops only to hit a high-speed 4K 120p for slow-motion work. As someone who owned and used the A7 IV professionally for about two years (before selling it to upgrade to another model), the A7 V has much of what I wish that camera could do for me. I got to use one for a very brief period, and being able to shoot silently in most situations like my other cameras is incredibly helpful for shooting freely in a quiet environment — like a wedding ceremony. One of my biggest gripes with my A7 IV was the delay while waiting for the live view to switch from the LCD to the EVF. The split-second moment of temporary blindness wasn’t egregiously long, but the A7 V’s faster switching brings it closer to the super-speedy feel of the pro A1 and A9 III cameras. I’m spoiled, I know, but once you adjust to it you don’t want to go back to a slower response time every time you pull up your second body. The A7 V’s new screen and ergonomic improvements are also welcome changes. I still don’t love Sony’s grip feel, even though they’re my cameras of choice, but Sony makes the best articulating screens around, offering the best of both worlds for photo and video. Up until now, these excellent screens have been reserved for pricier models, and I’m excited for more people to have access to them. It’s easy for the Sony A7 V to seem like a bit of a ho-hum update, kind of like last year’s A1 II upgrade was for pros. But Sony did a nice job focusing on refining and improving all of the base A7’s bread-and-butter features. It’s a greatest hits album of many of Sony’s recent new features. It’s a shame this line keeps getting pricier, as it’s launching at $500 more than the A7 IV’s original price and $200 more than the IV’s current tariff-inflated price, but new sensor tech is costlier sensor tech. Sony was quick to innovate and iterate on its Alpha cameras for years, giving it a massive head start in the mirrorless world ahead of Canon, Nikon, and others. But it’s been feeling like that innovation has stalled a bit in recent models. Now that Sony has played all its latest cards across its current crop and given its A7 V samples of its latest tech, we’ll have to see if Sony’s next generation of cameras can make any of the big jumps forward like it’s been previously known for.

"Trump is 'committed' to $2,000 tariff dividend payments, White House says This comes after the treasury secretary appeared to cast doubt on payments. President Donald Trump remains ""committed"" to sending each American a $2,000 dividend check to be distributed from tariff revenue, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday. White House officials are exploring ways to execute the plan put forward by Trump in a social media post over the weekend, Leavitt added, but she did not provide details about specific options. ""The president made it clear he wants to make it happen,"" Leavitt told reporters at the White House. ""So his team of economic advisers are looking into it."" The firm stance from the White House comes days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared to cast doubt on Trump's proposal, saying the payout could merely refer to tax savings enshrined by Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill legislation. A tariff dividend may come ""in lots of forms,"" Bessent told ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, adding that he had not spoken with Trump about the proposal. ""It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility on auto loans. Those are substantial deductions that are being financed in the tax bill,"" Bessent added. Some economists have questioned whether the dividend is achievable with available tariff funds. Trump announced the policy proposal in a brief message on social media on Sunday morning, focused on tariff-related tax revenue. ""People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k's are Highest EVER,"" the president wrote. ""A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone."" The message did not specify who would qualify for the payout or how the policy would operate. Two pandemic-era stimulus checks authorized by Trump were made available to individuals bringing in as much as $75,000 per year and couples earning up to $150,000. Beyond those benchmarks, higher earners were eligible for smaller payments. If Trump were to make the dividend payments available to anyone earning $100,000 or less, the policy would reach about 150 million Americans, amounting to roughly $300 billion in dividends, Erica York, a policy expert at the Tax Foundation, said in a post on X. As of Sept. 30, the federal government had generated $195 billion in tariff-related revenue, according to the Treasury Department. By that math, the estimated $300 billion cost of the dividend check proposal would far exceed the amount of currently available tariff revenue. In theory, however, the Trump administration could promise to pay the dividend from anticipated tariff revenue. The Treasury Department has forecast $3 trillion in tariff revenue over the next decade. Should the Trump administration choose that route, the dividend payments would add to the federal debt, which currently stands at over $38 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",left
"CEO challenging Trump at Supreme Court could trigger wave of tariff refunds: ""I definitely want my money back"" Rick Woldenberg says it's not in his nature, nor consistent with the mission of his Chicago-area toy business, to sit quietly in the face of an existential threat. So last April, a few weeks after the Trump administration unveiled sweeping tariffs on so-called ""Liberation Day,"" he took action. Woldenberg sued President Trump and his top advisers, alleging in a 37-page complaint Mr. Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs amounted to an illegal ""Executive Branch power grab."" After a lower court sided with Woldenberg in June, the Trump administration appealed, and on Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard the case to decide the fate of the president's signature economic policy. ""I just wasn't willing to be led to a slaughter by the politicians,"" Woldenberg told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Maurice DuBois. ""So we did what we're allowed to do, which is to push back."" Woldenberg heads Learning Resources, which manufactures most of its 2,000 educational toys in Asia. He has taken a path that stands in stark contrast to many top business leaders who grouse privately about the uncertainty wrought by Mr. Trump's tariffs but stay quiet in public or try to lobby the president behind closed doors. ""I'm not a politician and this is not a political movement,"" Woldenberg said. ""This is a lawsuit over the interpretation of a law."" The Supreme Court is being asked to weigh in on whether the president has the legal authority to levy tariffs on a foreign country in order to address a national emergency, such as the fentanyl crisis, illegal migration, or persistent trade deficits, all of which Mr. Trump has cited. Should the Court uphold his tariffs, Mr. Trump has said the decision would guarantee American prosperity. If Woldenberg prevails, the White House claims economic catastrophe would follow because the administration might be forced to pay back billions to American companies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month the U.S. would have to refund about half of the more than $200 million in tariff revenue collected this year. Woldenberg estimates a third of his 500 employees have had to shift their roles to focus on tariffs. Learning Resources has paid between $5 million and $10 million in tariffs this year so far. ""I definitely want my money back,"" he said. ""The government has chosen to hit us with a massive tax."" For years, Woldenberg has fought government attempts to infringe on his business. In 2009, he fought the Obama administration on tougher lead-testing rules in toys. And while he donated $7,000 to the Kamala Harris campaign in the 2024 election, Woldenberg insists his decision to sue the president isn't political. He has previously given to both Democrats and Republicans. On a recent Friday morning, workers at the company's 356,000-square-foot warehouse, north of Chicago, were preparing and loading shipments bound for big box retailers like WalMart and mom-and-pop toy stores nationwide. Woldenberg says factories in China and Vietnam have unique advantages: labor to assemble items like the company's ever-popular toddler cash register and source materials for products like ""BubblePlush,"" a new children's yoga ball that he expects to do well this Christmas. He said shifting production to the U.S. would be impossible. ""We can't do it,"" said Woldenberg, who took over in 1998 the business his family has run for decades. ""And we don't see our competitors doing it."" What they have done is play ""whack-a-mole,"" reacting to almost daily swings in the tariff rate. For example, after Mr. Trump took aim at China, raising the tariff rate to 145%, Learning Resources shifted some production to India. But then in August, the president raised India's tariff rate to 50%, and Woldenberg raced to ship those products to the U.S to avoid additional penalties. ""It was like a bat-outta-hell emergency,"" he said. ""And we had until Sept. 16 to clear customs in this country and the boat sauntered in six hours late. So, that cost us 50 grand."" Along with Woldenberg's case, the Supreme Court heard a similar case brought by five other small businesses and a group of Democratic state attorneys general. In that case, a federal appeals court ruled many of the president's tariffs are illegal. The case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of the most consequential of Mr. Trump's second-term policies. The high court has weighed in on an interim emergency basis on challenges to many of the president's initiatives, most recently in his bid to fire Federal Reserve commissioner Lisa Cook. Woldenberg said he's confident the Court will grant him relief. ""We and the hundreds of thousands of other similarly situated businesses will get the unlawfully collected taxes rebated to us,"" he said.",left
"Trump on rising NIL bidding wars: 'These colleges are all going to go out of business' ESPN's ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Nov. 11 was being filmed live from the Marines depot at Parris Island, S.C. on Veterans Day. So the Commander-in-Chief called. President Donald Trump joined the program and touched on a number of topics, including college sports. He was asked whether he felt former Alabama coach Nick Saban would be a choice to fix college sports. “Well I know him, and I got to know him because he brought his team to the White House,"" Trump said. ""He won a lot, and I got to know him. He’s a fantastic guy, and you know he’s somebody they should really get involved in college sports in terms of making sure it all works out because what’s happening, it looks like it’s not working out too well. Colleges, for most of the people, a lot of the lesser sports are being totally terminated, you know that, it’s a shame. It was almost like a training ground for the Olympics, and a lot of those training grounds are being lost. ""And you know, Nick knows this stuff better than anybody. He’d be, and he’s really active in it. I think they ought to let Nick Saban take a good, strong look at it, and we all, I could tell you, from my standpoint, I’d listen to what Nick has to say. I know him well, and he’s a fantastic guy, and what a great coach.” Trump's vision for college football Trump's vision for college sports aligns more with a Democrat-sponsored Senate bill. The SAFE Act is a far-reaching bill that requires the Federal Trade Commission to oversee college sports. It is nearly the polar opposite of the Republican-sponsored SCORE bill in the House, which seeks antitrust exemptions from the federal government to make and enforce rules on NIL, player movement and eligibility. The SAFE Act also provides for the expansion of the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 to college sports, allowing conferences to pool media rights in an effort to increase revenue and provide funding for all sports. The SAFE Act ensures all sports will be paid for, and not eliminated due to a lack of funding. In a follow-up, McAfee asked the president about NIL and the big business of college sports and its sustainability. ""I think we all understand that the players deserve money, I think we all understand their value, but I think an actual market with guardrails would be something that would be really good,"" McAfee said. ""This could be something, along with stopping wars, and building in tariffs and $17 trillion, maybe just put that on your desk."" “Well it is a very serious problem because even football where they give quarterbacks $12 million, $13-$14 million… all of a sudden you’re going to be out of control,"" Trump said. ""And even rich colleges are going to go bust because you’re not going to be able to do this. And you know they had the old way, they gave scholarships, they did lots of good things, but there could be some form of payment. ""But when they start bidding up the costs, look the NFL and all the leagues have caps. You don’t really have that in college sports, and when the guard comes along that weighs 350 pounds and he’s phenomenal and they say it’s the difference between having a great team and a lousy team, they gave him $10 million, that’s going to start happening pretty soon. All of a sudden you’re going to have like NFL-type payrolls. I don’t care how rich the colleges are, you don’t make that much money, even the most successful. They’re not going to be able to do this. ""Bad things are going to happen unless we figure this out. That’s why a guy like Nick Saban, now I’ve worked with Nick, but a guy like Nick Saban and some others getting together because they’re going to have to do something. Colleges can’t afford it. And what they’re doing, I don’t want to use any particular sport because it’s degrading, but they are really terminating a lot of sports, you know, sports you would call them lesser sports. But big sports, good sports. Sports where there have tremendous interest, they’re getting rid of them, and frankly the college football is very big, but as big as it is, if they don’t do some very powerful caps, these colleges are all going to go out of business, no matter how rich they are.”",left

"Delays, smaller payments: How SNAP funding will work The White House said it would give partial payments to 42 million recipients. The Trump administration said Monday it would provide partial payments to about 42 million food stamp recipients in November, though the White House warned the funds could take as long as months to reach households. The move promised some eventual relief as the government shutdown nears a record for the longest impasse in the nation’s history. The Trump administration, however, declined to use alternate funding that would have enabled the delivery of full SNAP benefits this month. The move to partially fund SNAP could delay benefits as states calculate and distribute the food subsidies, and the smaller payment may only grant recipients days or weeks before they face the threat of going without food anew, experts told ABC News. “The stress that families are facing throughout the country is tremendous, not knowing how they’re going to feed their families,” Colleen Heflin, a professor of public administration and international affairs at Syracuse University, told ABC News. Here’s what to know about SNAP funding. Is the Trump administration planning to provide SNAP benefits during the government shutdown? Yes, the Trump administration said it plans to expend partial funds for food stamp recipients in November. The emergency funding for SNAP will cover “50% of eligible households’ current allotments,” the Justice Department said in a court filing on Monday. The DOJ lawyers agreed to spend $4.65 billion on SNAP, which amounts to about half of the estimated $8 billion cost to fund SNAP in November. In the court filing, the Justice Department vowed to spend money available in a contingency fund for SNAP, giving individual states the opportunity to ""calculate the benefits available for each eligible household."" The disclosure came after a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funds to pay for SNAP amid an ongoing government shutdown. Will SNAP benefits be delayed? Some SNAP recipients were due to receive funds in the first few days of November, meaning their benefits have already been delayed. The logistical challenge posed by a partial delivery of benefits is expected to delay payments further, though the timeline will likely vary from state to state, experts told ABC News. Using emergency funds to pay for reduced SNAP benefits could take ""a few weeks to up to several months,"" a top U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) official told a federal judge in a sworn court filing on Monday. Since food stamps are administered at the state level, the USDA is expected to provide instructions to state agencies, which will then calculate the level of partial benefits for each recipient and provide those figures to be loaded onto the electronic cards used by families, Tracy Roof, a professor of political science at the University of Rhode Island who studies the food stamp program, told ABC News. ""The daunting part is that states have to go in and make this adjustment to their payment amounts,"" Roof said, estimating the operational hurdle could range from several days to more than a week after a federal directive, depending on the state. How will SNAP benefits be funded during the government shutdown? The Trump administration on Monday committed to spend SNAP funds available in an emergency account meant to aid families in the event of an interruption of the program. That reserve of contingency funds carries a total of about $6 billion, according to the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, putting the account well short of the $8 billion necessary to fully fund SNAP in November. The Trump administration said it would tap $4.65 billion in funds. The Trump administration opted against drawing upon a larger pot of money set aside for child nutrition programs by the Department of Agriculture. This alternate fund holds about $30 billion, far exceeding roughly $3 billion per month needed to fund the relevant child nutrition payments, David Super, a law professor at Georgetown University, told ABC News. The pot of money has built sizable reserves due to annual surpluses and an arrangement for the fund to share in a portion of tariff revenue, Super added. ""The Trump administration could transfer enough money over to SNAP to pay for full benefits in November without any conceivable risk to child nutrition,"" Super said, adding that the fund could likely also support full benefits in December ""without breaking a sweat."" How long will partial SNAP funding hold over families? The partial SNAP funding will amount to roughly half of a family’s typical monthly benefit, though the exact total could vary depending on the state and characteristics of a given beneficiary, experts said. Those partial benefits are expected to last recipients about two weeks, some experts said, noting the program could hold over families in the event of a speedy resolution of the government shutdown. ""But it’s certainly a lot of anxiety because people won’t know when they might expect to get the rest of the money,"" Roof said. Most states provide SNAP benefits on a staggered basis, meaning a portion of the recipients gain access at the outset of the month while others follow over the ensuing days or weeks. In turn, some recipients likely still retain benefits from October while others could be forced to go without funds during the current delay, the experts added. Could states make up for the loss of federal SNAP funding? Experts cast doubt on the capacity for state governments or philanthropic organizations to make up for the full shortfall in SNAP benefits. But some states, such as Virginia, have vowed to provide a comparable subsidy. ""States may legally be allowed to make up the lost funds but they haven’t been given a guarantee it will be reimbursed to them even after the government reopens,"" Parke Wilde, a food economist at Tufts University, told ABC News. Super, of Georgetown, noted that the financial burden of the food stamp payments would be significant for state governments. ""Fiscally, it’s a lot of money and I think the states would find it difficult to do,"" Super said. ""And operationally, there would be various steps that would need to be taken to make that happen, which some states are probably set up to do better than others.""",left
"This holiday season, tariffs are threatening the survival of a small Christmas supply business outside of Salt Lake City. Jared and Dawnita Hendricks have owned Village Lighting for 23 years, selling and distributing a variety of Christmas products to big box stores and directly to consumers online. The company currently employs 15 people. But when Village Lighting's 2025 holiday season garlands, wreaths, lights and decor arrived by ship at U.S. ports from Asia in recent months, many of them carried additional tariff costs of up to 50% per item. These added fees are the result of President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, which has raised U.S. import duties to levels not seen in over a century. The Trump administration claims tariffs will boost the U.S. economy in part by forcing manufacturers to move operations to the United States, and further by forcing U.S. trade partners to make concessions. But these global economic forces feel very far away from West Valley City, Utah, where tariff costs at Village Lighting are outpacing the company's expected profit margins. “The tariff costs in and of themselves are not sustainable, and I don’t believe we can raise the cost enough to the consumers to be profitable,” Jared Hendricks told NBC News during an interview at his warehouse in Utah. It’s an issue plaguing the entire Christmas decor industry, which for decades has relied on goods imported from Asia. American small businesses importing holiday decor this year have already spent more than $400 million on tariff fees, according to an estimate from a coalition of small businesses called “We Pay the Tariffs,” which counts Village Lighting among its members. Compared to the roughly $26 million these same companies paid in tariffs last year, that's an increase of at least 1,438%. Across the United States, companies of all sizes have tried to time their overseas orders in the hopes of avoiding the worst tariff fees. But for Village Lighting, which orders inventory up to a year in advance, this wasn't an option. After enjoying one of the company's most successful years ever in 2024, the Hendrickses decided to order extra inventory this year, a process that began last December and was completed by February. So when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners in early April, it was too late for the Hendrickses to cut back their orders, which were already loaded on container ships by the time the tariffs took effect. In an effort to keep their prices as low as possible, the Hendrickses have opted to absorb the majority of the added tariff costs. So far, that has cost them nearly $750,000 and counting. Tariffs are withdrawn directly from the couple’s bank account 30 days after each product arrives at a U.S. port. Their goal is to keep any retail price hikes under 5% this Christmas season. But the only way to do that, said Jared, was by “leveraging everything,” including their home, with a line of credit. “We went from working towards a profit to working for tariffs,” said Jared. “It’s affected our home life, our health. It has been the most stressful, difficult, challenging year of 23 years of businesses that we ever had.” This isn't the first time Village Lighting has had to contend with abrupt changes to tariff rates. During the first Trump administration, average U.S. tariff rates on Chinese imports swelled to around 20%, up from a simple tariff rate of just 2.8% in 2015. The Hendrickses responded at the time by attempting to diversify their supply chain across several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, Cambodia and Malaysia. But these countries were all hit with high tariffs in early April of this year, swept up in Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs. At that point, said Jared, all his planning “went out the window.” Moving Village Lighting’s manufacturing operations to the United States would be nearly impossible, the Hendrickses say, because of the type of complex machinery and skilled labor that are required to make the Christmas goods they sell. “A dozen different factories go into one wreath or garland,” Jared said. “It’s not a matter of me opening up one factory. It’s a matter of me opening up two dozen factories and somehow providing a pathway to get raw materials.” He said that it was unlikely “that anyone in our situation could ever financially find a way to make that happen.” The Hendrickses are not alone in feeling the sting of tariffs this holiday season. Consumers are dealing with it, too. According to a recent survey from the National Retail Federation, 85% of shoppers expect to pay more this year because of tariffs. And they’re right — Lending Tree, an online lending marketplace, found that tariffs will cost the average American an additional $132 on their holiday expenses this year. Goldman Sachs estimates that consumers are picking up as much as 55% of overall tariff costs. The Hendrickses said they feel like small businesses are bearing the brunt of Trump’s tariff pains. “When there was Covid, it felt like the whole country was kind of in it together,” said Dawnita Hendricks. “This kind of feels like it’s just us against the failure of our business, because of something we cannot control.” That lack of control is clouding Village Lighting’s future. “After 23 years, you kind of start thinking about, What’s the second half of my life going to look like?” said Jared. “Are we going to be able to move to the next level so that we can retire and enjoy our grandchildren and whatever?” Tariffs, he said, “really just put a halt to that and made us question, ‘What’s next?’”",left
"You can’t say that Team Trump is in denial about the extent and the implications of the electoral rebuke its party received on November 4. All of a sudden, from the president on down, Republicans can’t stop talking about affordability. Donald Trump himself alternates between claiming he’s already pushed the cost of living way down and publicly mulling ways to convince Americans to feel better about their ability to make ends meet. Obviously Republicans need to improve the president’s sinking job-approval numbers in anticipation of high-stakes midterm elections. But more immediately, the GOP must decide how to deal with the health-insurance “cliff” it created by failing to extend Obamacare premium subsidies in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and then refusing Democratic demands to fix the problem in legislation reopening the government. Republicans clearly can’t bring themselves to just extend the subsidies, even with the concessions on their cost and eligibility that Democrats would almost certainly accept. The Senate vote they promised on the issue by December will likely fall short of any actual results, and House Republicans are signaling unmistakably that they have no stomach for anything that looks like a blessing of the hated legacy health-care program of the 44th president (which they are now calling the Unaffordable Care Act). Recognizing that Democrats won’t agree to any “Obamacare alternative,” the White House is making it known they are warming to the idea of a second budget reconciliation bill (the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was the first) that would include health care and other goodies as part of a midterm “affordability” agenda, as Politico reports: “We’re going to have the health care conversation. We’re going to put some legislation forward,” White House deputy chief of staff James Blair said Tuesday at a Bloomberg Government policy breakfast. He expressed interest in a bipartisan health plan but said that “if that path is foreclosed, there is the partisan path of reconciliation as well.” Such a move would allow Republicans to advance a health plan with a simple majority, a path they unsuccessfully attempted in Trump’s first term to repeal Obamacare but successfully used earlier this year on the megabill … If a reconciliation bill moves soon, Blair indicated that the administration would also want to include “probably the Trump tariff dividends and … interest in locking in tariffs.” That last sentence is important. The conventional wisdom is that you don’t move major controversial legislation in an election year. In addition, most Republicans remember that the 2017 reconciliation bill aimed at repealing and replacing Obamacare failed, while a later tax-cut bill succeeded. So if they’re going back to the well on “Trumpcare,” they’ll need some sweeteners, and the so-called tariff dividends, which are really just stimulus checks under another name, would fill the bill. The other strong possibility is that the administration and its allies will structure “Trumpcare 2.0” to look a lot like free money as well. The president himself has been hitting this angle at Truth Social: THE ONLY HEALTHCARE I WILL SUPPORT OR APPROVE IS SENDING THE MONEY DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PEOPLE, WITH NOTHING GOING TO THE BIG, FAT, RICH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHO HAVE MADE $TRILLIONS, AND RIPPED OFF AMERICA LONG ENOUGH. THE PEOPLE WILL BE ALLOWED TO NEGOTIATE AND BUY THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, INSURANCE. POWER TO THE PEOPLE! Congress, do not waste your time and energy on anything else. This is the only way to have great Healthcare in America!!! GET IT DONE, NOW. President DJT In reality, what he’s almost certainly talking about is the ancient Republican scheme of returning to the days before comprehensive health insurance was a thing and, instead of subsidizing insurance premiums, giving individuals some money to combine with their own savings to pay for all non-catastrophic health costs out of pocket. If you’re young and healthy, it could be a hell of a deal. If you’re older, sicker, or poorer, maybe not so much, particularly if the “new deal” on health care is paid for by cuts in safety-net programs like Medicaid (which was the case in the 2017 Trumpcare legislation). Although there are many devils in the details, what may make this approach attractive is the more money for you angle Trump is already promoting. If packaged in a bill that also provides “tariff dividends,” and perhaps more middle-class tax breaks like the ones used to dress up OBBBA, you could have purely partisan election-year legislation that addresses affordability concerns by literally giving cash to voters. Will that do anything to reduce inflation? No, and in fact, it could have the opposite effect. But it doesn’t even have to be enacted to serve as a vehicle for GOP midterm messaging, and even if it is, the economic and fiscal fallout would be mañana. It’s always possible Republicans will rethink this approach and compromise with Democrats to deal with the immediate Obamacare premium spike in a direct way and put off their dreams of undoing the Affordable Care Act until later. If they were really clever, they’d design an Obamacare subsidy extension that would expire if and when Trumpcare is a reality. But it’s unlikely they’ll be able to bring themselves to even a temporary compromise when the chimera of buying off the electorate while bypassing Obamacare seems possible.

"The US Department of Agriculture ordered states to stop issuing full food stamp benefits for November and to “immediately undo” any issuance of the full allotments, after a Supreme Court justice on Friday paused a lower court order requiring the agency to pay Americans their full assistance. In the Saturday directive, obtained by CNN, the USDA told states to instead proceed with issuing partial benefits — which will provide 65% of the maximum allotments for November — as ordered by the same lower court judge earlier in the week. (Many recipients will receive less than 65% of their usual assistance because of the way food stamp benefits are calculated.) “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.” States that fail to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over issuances of benefits, the memo said. This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly 1 in 8 Americans who depend on the nation’s larger anti-hunger program. Over the past week, the USDA has issued guidance multiple times as lawsuits over the agency’s decision not to tap into a contingency fund to pay November benefits have worked their way through federal courts. The latest guidance follows a memorandum from the department on Friday saying it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal lower court order, and that the process should be completed later that day. Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in coming days. Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Friday that residents who should have already gotten their SNAP benefits this month will start getting their full payments on Friday. The next day, a Shapiro spokesperson told CNN that residents who received their benefits are able to spend them, but the state has paused issuing full allocations to additional people. Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that there’s “no clarity at all” in the guidance and that the administration is causing “intentional chaos.” “Once we decided to step up and say we are going to make sure that our people are going to be OK … we’ve now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money,” Moore said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Legal battles Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday evening temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to cover full food stamp benefits, siding with the administration on a short-term basis in a legal fight that has quickly become a defining confrontation of the government shutdown. The ruling meant the USDA does not have to immediately honor a lower court order that required it to transfer $4 billion to the key food assistance program. Jackson’s ruling followed one a day earlier by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island that directed the agency to make the full payments, reversing his own order from earlier in the month requiring the USDA to tap into its $5.3 billion contingency fund to pay at least partial benefits for the month. His more expansive ruling mandated the agency shift tariff revenue meant for child nutrition programs to pay full SNAP benefits for November. The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in appropriations for the government. The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling in recent weeks that the agency must at least pay partial benefits or, at its discretion, provide recipients with their full allotments. The agency opted to provide partial payments — first saying states could issue 50% of the maximum benefit and then revising the figure to 65%. But the USDA warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. The plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case raced back to McConnell last week to argue that he should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly. McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month. Providing full benefits Wisconsin immediately filed for 100% of its residents’ benefits to be placed on their electronic benefit transfer cards, according to the Department of Justice’s filing to the Supreme Court. But the USDA rejected the request because it had not yet had time to comply with McConnell’s order. That resulted in the state overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million. Responding to the USDA’s demand that states should undo any steps taken to issue full benefits, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said on Sunday, “No.” The state loaded November benefits onto the cards of nearly 700,000 residents on Friday prior to the Supreme Court’s pause, he said in a statement. “We are eager for the court to resolve this issue by directing the Trump Administration to comply with court orders and provide the certainty to the many Wisconsin families and businesses who rely on FoodShare,” he said. Similarly, Kansas issued full benefits worth nearly $32 million to approximately 86,000 households in the state, the filing said. These actions have hurt states that did not move quickly to issue benefits, according to the DOJ. They will be unable to receive funding to provide partial payments to their residents under McConnell’s prior order. Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly reacted to the Supreme Court’s action in a statement Friday night, saying, “In accordance with a court’s order and after receiving guidance from the USDA, Kansas sent full November SNAP benefits to all eligible Kansans. These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates.” North Carolina, which issued partial benefits to more than 586,000 households on Friday, said it was pausing the issuance of full benefits in light of the Supreme Court decision. It had hoped to issue them over the weekend. “The hard-working people and families who rely on SNAP benefits deserve certainty, not confusion about whether they’ll be able to put meals on the table this weekend and the rest of the month,” North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement Saturday. “I am urging for a swift resolution by the courts and some humanity from the Trump administration so North Carolina families can receive the support they need.” In Massachusetts, Democratic Gov. Maura Healey said that residents should continue spending the benefits on their EBT cards, noting the state funded them in accordance with USDA’s Friday guidance before the Supreme Court’s pause. “If President Trump wants to penalize states for preventing Americans from going hungry, we will see him in court,” Healey said in a statement Sunday, adding that state officials will continue to work to “make sure everyone gets the full benefits they are owed.” CNN is reaching out to other states to ask the status of their SNAP programs. CNN’s John Fritze and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",left

"Trump administration announces trade frameworks with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador Washington — The Trump administration has reached frameworks for reciprocal trade agreements with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador, the White House announced Thursday, although details of the frameworks are still emerging. The tariff rate for most goods from Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina will continue to be 10%, while Ecuador will remain at 15%, senior administration officials told reporters on a briefing call. But there will be tariff relief on a number of items, particularly those that can't be grown in the U.S. Senior administration officials didn't list those items, nor do the joint statements about the frameworks released by the White House, but one senior administration official anticipated that coffee and bananas from Ecuador, for instance, would see tariff relief. ""The United States commits to remove its reciprocal tariffs on certain qualifying exports from Ecuador that cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States in sufficient quantities,"" the framework joint statement for Ecuador released by the White House says. Senior administration officials couldn't provide details on how the trade agreements would affect the cost of goods like coffee, cocoa or bananas, which the U.S. imports from Central and South American nations, although one senior administration official said it would likely have ""positive"" effects. Those specific commodities are important because ""we don't make those in the United States,"" the official said. ""Our expectation is that there will be some positive effects for prices for things like coffee, cocoa, bananas,"" the official said. The White House said the administration will work to finalize the agreements in the coming weeks. Senior administration officials said the agreement frameworks are largely focused on allowing those foreign markets to accept more U.S. goods. Generally, the agreements also aim to open up markets to import U.S. agricultural products and to prohibit imposing digital services taxes on U.S. companies. The U.S. has reached trade deals of some nature with the European Union, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea and the United Kingdom, among other countries.",left
"'It's insane': ACA policyholders say soaring health insurance premiums are jeopardizing lives One said she's being ""run out of my country because of healthcare costs."" Colorado mom Astrid Storey, a thyroid cancer patient with an autoimmune disorder, was recently notified that her monthly premiums under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will jump by nearly $500 in 2026. A naturalized U.S. citizen from Panama, she said she's now contemplating what was once unthinkable: giving up her American dream and moving to a country with universal health care. Nathan Boye of Orlando, Florida, has diabetes and said he's been informed the monthly premiums for his ACA policy would soar from $28 to more than $700. The married father-of-three said he is now considering foregoing health insurance altogether. And Doug Butchart, whose wife, Shadene, is living with the neurological disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) said he doesn't know how he's going to pay for her medications. A retired mechanic from Elgin, Illinois, Butchart said he's gotten a notice that the monthly premiums on his wife's ACA policy will climb to $2,000. Combined with an annual deductible of more than $8,000 and $10,000 in out-of-pocket expenses, he said his wife's health care costs will total more than his monthly Social Security check, which they both live on. An estimated 22 million of the 24 million ACA marketplace enrollees are currently receiving enhanced premium tax credits to lower their monthly premiums, which were part of the original ACA legislation and expanded in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic under the American Rescue Plan. But with the tax credits set to expire at the end of this year, many policyholders are learning the ACA, commonly referred to as Obamacare, will no longer be affordable unless Congress intervenes. An extension of the tax credits was not included in President Donald Trump's megabill, which was signed into law in July. The issue has become a political football, prolonging the government shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history. The majority of Democrats have refused to vote to reopen the government until Republicans agree to extend the ACA subsidies. But GOP leaders say they won't negotiate until a clean funding bill passes and the government reopens. As both sides blame each other for the shutdown, millions of Americans who bought into the ACA marketplace find themselves caught in the crossfire of the stalemate. Premiums set to rise even without the tax credits Storey, a graphic designer and owner of a small business in Denver, said she doesn't receive the ACA tax credits. But in a notice from her insurance provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, which she shared with ABC News, her monthly premiums are set to rise from $1,400 to nearly $1,900. ""I have an autoimmune disease, and I also have thyroid cancer. So, I had very specific needs as to which doctors and which medicines I needed to have covered in this plan,"" Storey said, adding that she has a $2,000 deductible and many out-of-pocket expenses. Storey, 45, said she purchased her policy through Connect for Health Colorado, her state's ACA portal, and has been working with a broker provided by the insurance carrier to help navigate the added costs. Storey said her husband, Denis, who has been doing contracting work for her business, has taken a part-time job at a Starbucks to help make ends meet. But Storey said there is a limit to how much more she can pay for health care. If her premium rises to $2,500 a month, she said that she and her family will sell all their belongings and leave the country. Storey said she also has citizenship in Panama and Spain, the latter of which has universal health care. ""I have a lot of feelings about being run out of my country because of health care costs,"" Storey said. ""The American dream is a disappointment when it comes to health care."" In a statement to ABC News, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said that its ACA plan rates ""reflect the care and costs we expect members to use next year. Like other insurers, we’re seeing higher utilization and more complex care among ACA members -- particularly in emergency room visits, behavioral health and specialty pharmacy. For instance, ACA members use the ER at nearly twice the rate of those with employer-sponsored coverage."" Laid off due to tariffs, now facing more than a 2,500% jump in premiums Boye, from Florida, said he currently pays $28 a month for his ACA plan through Blue Cross Blue Shield, and that 90% of the medications he needs to control his diabetes are covered. He was notified last month that the monthly premium is set to rise to $733 without financial help, a 2,518% increase. Boye told ABC News on Thursday that after doing more research and reapplying through the ACA portal, he found a plan that has monthly premiums of $113 a month, contingent on a $620 tax credit. Boye said he qualified for the ACA tax credits after he was laid off earlier this year as an operations manager for a company that imported medical supplies from China. ""We had to close down because of the tariff. It made it impossible to import,"" Boye said. While he has picked up part-time work, he said he enrolled at Valencia College in Orlando to finish his degree in business administration. His wife, he said, has insurance through her job as a teacher's assistant at the University of Central Florida, where she is also studying history. He said their three children, ages 11 to 16, are insured through Medicaid. Boye said he won't be able to pay the increase in his premiums, and is hoping Congress works out a deal to restore the ACA tax credits. He said he has until mid-December to reenroll in his plan. But if the tax credits are not restored, Boye said he is contemplating making a radical change. ""I gave up on the idea of having health care,"" Boye said. Boye said he's already started researching discount drug companies and cash-pay programs on how he can purchase on his own the two primary medications he uses to control diabetes. He showed ABC News an invoice he got in September indicating his insurance covered the $1,669 price of his primary medication, Jardiance. Boye said his current predicament has left him feeling like a ""tiny fish that does not matter."" ""Realistically, I have no control over any of this,"" he said. ""I'm just a person who has to navigate the waters and find a solution."" In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Florida Blue said that, next year, there will be ""higher insurance costs for many, and government financial help (premium tax credits) will decrease if the enhanced premium tax credits expire, as they are planned to."" The organization said it understood members' concerns and is committed to supporting members, but added that premium increases ""are an industry-wide issue, a necessary but concerning response to federal regulatory changes including the scheduled expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits at the end of 2025, as well as the rising cost and utilization of medical care and prescription drugs."" 'It’s real people that all of this is affecting' The Butcharts, from Illinois, traveled to Washington, D.C., this week with members of the Muscular Dystrophy Association to discuss their precarious situation with congressional leaders, including their two Illinois senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, both Democrats. The 67-year-old Doug Butchart said he wanted to show the lawmakers ""that it's for real, that it's real people that all of this is affecting."" Butchart said he has received notification, which he shared with ABC News, that the monthly premiums on his wife's ACA policy through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois will rise from $603.82 to up to $2,000 without the tax credits in 2026. According to the notice he received, even with a tax credit estimated at $738, the monthly premium would be nearly $1,400. ""It's insane,"" Butchart told ABC News. He said his 58-year-old wife was diagnosed with ALS eight years ago, adding that about 10% of ALS patients survive that long. Butchart said his wife's main medication, Radicava, costs about $15,000 a month, and another medication costs $4,000 for a three-month supply. While insurance has covered most of their medical costs, Butchart said his wife's out-of-pocket expenses last year were about $3,000. He said that without the tax credits, and on top of the increased monthly premiums, his wife will have an $8,000 deductible in 2026, and her out-of-pocket expenses could top $10,000. ""That's a lot of money, way more money than we get in a year,"" said Butchart. He said he and his wife live off his Social Security income and that she does not qualify for Medicaid or any disability income. ""I don't want to put ourselves in a position where we're in debt. I'm not 20 years old or 30 years old where I can go out and get a second job,"" Butchart said. In a statement to ABC News, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois said it ""remains steadfast in its commitment to a stable health insurance market with competitive plan choices in the individual market, as we have since the inception of the ACA."" ""The rates for 2026 coverage include both new and current individual ACA-compliant plans and reflects industry-wide changes to the market, including the anticipated expiration of enhanced premium tax credits at the end of 2025. Plans are priced to reflect anticipated health care needs,"" the company said. But Butchart said the he still doesn't see how the company can ""justify"" such increases in premiums. “I wish the people who are making decisions and setting the prices were in the same position as we are,"" Butchart said.

"Generations work on family farms. With costs high and prices low, farmers worry they may lose it all. Tennessee farmer Franklin Carmack is haunted by concerns that he could lose the family farm. Carmack, a fifth-generation farmer, has been forced to take on work outside his fields — selling T-shirts, driving trucks and repairing boats — to try and ease his financial burden. It's affected his health, Carmack said, and he now takes four blood pressure pills a day. He thinks about the issue when he goes to bed at night. ""What's gonna be left in a year, two years? Am I the one that broke what started in the late 1800s?"" Carmack said he wonders. He's not alone: America's farmers are facing high costs, low prices and challenges from tariffs. Major row crops, including corn, soybeans, cotton and wheat, have not been profitable since at least 2022, according to United States Department of Agriculture data. Farmer frustrations Carmack and longtime friend Jeffrey Daniels grow cotton, soybeans and corn on their respective family farms. This year, instead of showing off crops at the West Tennessee State Fair, the pair sold T-shirts, made from cotton they grew, in an attempt to offset their losses in the fields. They sold about 250 shirts for $35 each, but it was hardly enough. This year, they expect to lose nearly $800,000 combined. Times are especially tough now because of input costs: everything a farmer needs to pull income from the ground, such as seed, equipment parts and fertilizer. Those costs have increased by more than 30% in the last five years, according to USDA data. This is, in part, due to inflation and rising interest rates. Cotton farmers have struggled with dwindling prices and decreased global demand as clothing manufacturers use more synthetic fabrics. ""The morale in the farming industry, not just farmers, is the lowest I've ever seen,"" Carmack said. ""Everybody's on edge."" In the first six months of 2025, there were 57% more farm bankruptcies than during the same period last year, according to United States Courts. Tariffs and the promise of federal help Daniels and Carmack say tariffs have made this year even harder. Soybeans have long been the largest U.S. export crop, worth nearly $25 billion last year, according to USDA. China, which primarily uses soybeans to feed its massive livestock industry, was the largest foreign buyer of America's soybeans. Sales ground to a halt in May when China stopped buying all U.S. soybeans as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs. Following a meeting last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mr. Trump said the additional 100% tariffs on certain imports from China, which he previously said would take effect Nov. 1, will not be implemented. Tariffs have also impacted the prices farmers pay to buy equipment. ""Anything that comes from China that's on that sprayer, there's a tariff and they're just going to pass it directly to us,"" Daniels said. Last week, Mr. Trump and Xi reached a one-year trade deal. But farmers said whatever comes next, the problems on farms run deep. ""Do you just keep going, rolling the dice, hoping things will turn? I mean, it's not looking good,"" Daniels said. Mr. Trump has promised a new bailout for American farmers – as much as $13 billion that he said would be paid for by the tariffs. ""It will help pay some bills, but that's not fixing the problem. It's a Band-Aid when we need stitches,"" Carmack said. Carmack and Daniels, like many farmers 60 Minutes spoke with in Tennessee and Missouri, said they'd rather work their fields than rely on taxpayer money. High numbers of suicides among farmers Farmers 60 Minutes met with say there are also worries about suicide in agricultural communities. Concerns for neighbors rise when crop sales drop. The suicide rate among agriculture workers is three times higher than it is among the general working population, according ot the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's most recent data in 2021. 60 Minutes' reporting shows that many rural mental health groups are seeing increased crisis calls to their hotlines. Jolie Foreman, who runs Shelby County Cares, a nonprofit organization focused on the high number of suicides among farmers, said her county has the highest rate of suicide per capita in the state of Missouri. The county has one therapist for about 6,000 people. ""[We] cannot really determine our success,"" Foreman said. ""We only can calculate the losses."" Though it's difficult to know how many lives have been saved, Foreman said she believes her program is working. In neighboring Macon County, Missouri, just a few miles away, there were two confirmed farm suicides this year. Foreman said she worries she could see an increase in the suicide rate because of the bleak financial situation for farmers. Shelby County Cares connects farmers with therapists, either in person or remotely. Foreman said walk-ins and calls to her office have increased since the beginning of the year. She's learned the best way to get farmers, who are traditionally stoic and fiercely independent, to talk is through their wives and through sharing food. Foreman said she personally knew farmers who took their own lives. ""In my own family, we've definitely had tragedy and have lost some very, you know, important people in our own family,"" she said. Since the 1970s, Foreman's father-in-law, Brent Foreman, has lost three relatives — all farmers — to suicide. Two neighbors of the family farm also recently took their own lives. ""I've always had a fear for my kids and now my grandkids that we sure don't want history to repeat itself,"" he said. ""You know, no matter how bad things get, things always have a way of working out. They'll always get better."" Faith in Trump's plan Brent Foreman and his son Jarrell grow more than 1,000 acres of soybeans and 650 acres of corn on a farm they manage themselves. They also raise more than 200 head of cattle, which means they are not reliant on soybeans as their sole source of income and can afford to wait for details on Mr. Trump's new trade deal. ""I have a lot of faith in him, and a lot of trust in him. And I think he's trying to make us the best deal he can for the whole country, but for the American farmer, for the long term,"" Brent Foreman said. Nearly 80% of voters in what are called farming-dependent counties voted for Mr. Trump in the last election, according to Investigate Midwest. ""I feel like a lot of American farmers, cattle people, it's a lot, a lot of people probably feel let down,"" Daniels said. ""Maybe there's a method to the madness, you know, that's still to be seen."" Many are now taking their frustrations directly to Republican lawmakers at town halls across the country. Carmack welcomed Mr. Trump to visit his farm. ""I'd show him the daily life that I do from cleaning equipment, running equipment, dispatching trucks,"" Carmack said. ""And then I'd hand him a stack of bills. And then I would show him the receipts, what I'm getting from my crop. He's a smart man. I'm not going to take that away from him. And it won't take him the five minutes to say, 'This isn't going to work.'""

"Costco seeks 'full refund' for tariffs in new lawsuit against Trump administration President Donald Trump imposed a flurry of tariffs earlier this year. Wholesale giant Costco has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for a ""full refund"" on import duties the company says it paid this year under global tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed by Costco at the U.S. Court of International Trade on Nov. 28, states that Congress, not the president, has the power to impose tariffs. Trump imposed a flurry of global tariffs in April, citing the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which gives the president power to regulate international commerce in the event of an ""unusual and extraordinary threat."" On Monday, Costco filed a motion to combine its lawsuit with nearly two dozen other lawsuits previously filed by other U.S. companies challenging the legality of Trump's IEEPA tariffs. ""The complaints are materially identical in allegations, theories, and ultimate requested relief,"" Costco wrote in its motion. One of the previously filed lawsuits is currently pending a decision at the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court strikes down Trump's tariffs, more than $90 billion of refunds could be owed. A decision is expected early next year. Costco's lawsuit states that the Court of International Trade and other federal courts ""have agreed the IEEPA duties are not authorized"" and are unlawful. ""This separate action is necessary, however, because even if the IEEPA duties and underlying executive orders are held unlawful by the Supreme Court, importers that have paid IEEPA duties, including Plaintiff, are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief,"" the lawsuit states. Costco, a membership warehouse club with over 800 locations across the U.S., according to its website, is seeking an immediate injunction against having to pay additional tariffs on products already imported while the Supreme Court case is pending. Costco is also seeking a refund for the tariff payments it incurred. In a statement to ABC News on Tuesday, White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said, ""The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court’s speedy and proper resolution of this matter."" Costco declined to comment on the lawsuit. ABC News' Taylor Dunn contributed to this report.",left
"Sen. Amy Klobuchar says ""future of capitalism"" at stake in Supreme Court tariffs case The Supreme Court sounded skeptical on Wednesday about President Trump's sweeping tariff agenda. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota attended the hearing and joins ""The Takeout"" with her takeaways.",left
"During both his presidential terms, Donald Trump has longed to make Americans happy by mailing them checks from the government adorned with his own signature in case anyone wants to write him a thank-you note in the form of a vote. So it’s not surprising that his big idea for responding to the rise of “affordability” as a national political issue is to send out $2,000 checks, allegedly to be financed by his trade-war tariffs. Do people think tariffs boost consumer prices? Okay, then, here’s a rebate! Or a “tariff dividend,” as he calls it. Now, that is very unlikely to come to pass for a variety of reasons. For one thing, Trump is vastly overestimating the tariff revenue that’s coming in. For another, his own administration and perhaps soon the Supreme Court are putting the brakes on his tariff offensive. And even more obviously, authorizing $2,000 checks from Trump for everybody at this particular moment has zero support among Democrats and not much support among Republicans, who mostly seem to be rolling their eyes over it. If they take it seriously at all, they tend to recommend that any “tariff dividends,” should they actually emerge, be used to reduce the public debt that Trump has never seemed to worry about for a moment. But the most telling (not to mention hilarious) reaction to the “tariff dividend” idea has come from Trump’s own Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, as Axios reported: The administration is hopeful Americans won’t necessarily spend the $2,000 tariff checks President Trump has promised, and instead pump them into “Trump accounts” for kids, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says … The risk of rising prices remains a huge concern for consumers, and against that backdrop, Fox News asked Bessent Tuesday night how the government would avoid another bout of stimulus-driven inflation if the checks happen. “Maybe we could persuade Americans to save that, because one of the things that’s going to happen next year” is the start of “Trump accounts” to save for kids, Bessent said. So the president wants to send checks to folks who are worried about making ends meet today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. But his top economic adviser is telling them not to cash those checks to pay for their living costs but to save them instead because (quite accurately) spending the money might boost living costs even more. Bessent was clever enough to couch this blatant contradiction of the president’s wishes in a recommendation that the money should go into Trump-branded savings vehicles (the subsidized kiddie savings accounts created by the One Big Beautiful Act). But it’s probably not what the president had in mind when he imagined grateful Americans using those checks to pay for groceries and gasoline while uttering a prayer of thanksgiving for their benefactor the president — and vowing to vote Republican in the 2026 midterms. Vote-buying is a simple proposition, but the people around Trump keep trying to complicate it. No wonder he’s angry and frustrated about “affordability.”",left
"President Donald Trump said on Friday that any document signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen ""is hereby terminated."" ""I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden,"" Trump posted on his social media platform. It is unclear which orders Trump is referencing and how he is making those determinations. ABC News has reached out to the White House for more information. Trump claimed that the people who ""operated the Autopen did so illegally."" But the Justice Department's legal counsel states that autopens are lawful for signing bills into law. The president has repeatedly fixated on Biden's use of the autopen. In June, Trump claimed Biden aides illegally used the autopen to carry out ""radical"" policies and ordered the Justice Department and White House to investigate Biden’s mental state when he was in office. At the time, Biden issued a statement to ABC News calling the probe “nothing more than a mere distraction.” ""Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,"" Biden said in the June statement. Trump has said he has used an autopen for some trivial matters, but criticized its use for pardons. -ABC News' Lalee Ibssa and Selina Wang",left
"Many Americans worried about high prices might expect some relief if a deeply skeptical Supreme Court reins in President Donald Trump’s tariffs. If you’re among them, don’t get your hopes up. In a consequential Supreme Court case Wednesday, a majority of the justices expressed concern that Trump may have overstepped his authority in levying tariffs with practically zero limits. Trump has imposed enormous import taxes in a number of unprecedented ways: He placed tariffs high enough to effectively serve as a temporary embargo on all Chinese goods, retaliated against Brazil’s conviction of its former president and Trump ally Jair Bolsanaro, and pressured India to ditch Russian oil. Those tariffs have begun to raise some prices for Americans, who ranked the cost of living as the most important issue facing the country in a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Nearly three quarters (72%) of Americans say the US economy is in bad shape, and 61% say Trump’s policies have made economic conditions worse. The Supreme Court may ultimately rule the bulk of Trump’s tariffs – his signature economic policy – to be illegal. But that wouldn’t give Americans much of a breather: Tariffs haven’t raised prices as much as you may think. And Trump has other tools to raise tariffs even if the Supreme Court rules against him. Tariffs’ limited effect The US government’s inflation data shows tariffs have started to gradually raise some prices, particularly for goods that are almost exclusively imported, such as shoes and furniture. Still, the overall pace of price hikes has been far from dramatic. Annual inflation rose to 3% in September, the highest rate since January but far from the 9% rate during the post-pandemic inflation crisis. Tariffs have had a limited impact for a number of reasons. - Trump delayed the implementation of his most consequential tariffs multiple times. - Businesses stockpiled goods ahead of Trump’s tariffs. - Foreign trading partners (with the notable exception of China) largely chose not to retaliate, so the global trade war sort of never happened as expected. - Businesses have – for the most part – eaten much of the tariffs’ cost. That’s not to say tariffs are inconsequential. Businesses have chosen to pay roughly 80% of the tariffs’ cost – for now – according to a recent JPMorgan analysis. And what you’re not feeling in your pocket, you may be feeling in your job prospects: That hit to companies’ profit has contributed to America’s slowing job market, JPMorgan economist Michael Hanson says. And consumers could still pay more of tariffs’ cost down the line. There’s mounting evidence companies are preparing to pass along those costs: Recent Producer Price Index reports showed that businesses are beginning to raise their wholesale prices, indicating many companies have reached the limit of what they can pay for before charging customers more. And CEOs on recent earnings calls have said some higher prices are inevitable. “There is no free lunch,” Hanson said. “We continue to expect that consumers ultimately will foot most of the tariff bill.” Nevertheless, most inflation-weary Americans are upset with the economy because the cumulative effect of higher prices have been wreaking havoc on the economy for the past five years – not because of tariffs, specifically. The typical household is spending $1,043 more per month than they did at the start of 2021 – for the same stuff, according to Moody’s. Paychecks haven’t kept up. Inflation rose to a four-decade high in 2022. That means an entire generation of Americans had never experienced anything like the surging prices of the past several years. Although inflation – the rate of those price hikes – has since returned to normal, those higher prices haven’t really had time to settle into the country’s psyche. People are still shocked when they compare the prices they’re paying now to what they were paying just a few years ago. Typically, price hikes occur gradually, in such small increments you hardly notice. And for some products, like new technology, prices can actually fall over time as supply increases – that’s why you can get a high-quality gigantic 4K TV for a couple hundred bucks now, when those TVs would set you back thousands a few years ago. This is something different: The first inflation shock many Americans experienced hasn’t yet worn off, and tariffs are a convenient – if largely inaccurate – foil for their pain. Trump can still impose tariffs The Supreme Court isn’t exactly Sonic the Hedgehog. Even with an expedited case, the justices may not rule for several months. In the meantime, Trump can continue to impose his tariffs, and price hikes may ultimately start to take hold of the economy. But if the Supreme Court ultimately rules that the bulk of his tariffs are illegal, Trump has other options, including other laws he’s already used to raise some import levies. They may be more restrictive than his broad use of emergency powers, but they’re not part of the current case before the Supreme Court. For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the president to raise tariffs on national security grounds. Trump has used that to raise steel, aluminum and copper tariffs. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to raise tariffs on nations deemed to violate trade agreements. And Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, although never used, would allow the president to raise tariffs up to 50% on countries if they’re believed to be engaged in discriminatory trade practices. Trump called the case “life or death.” But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Erin Burnett Wednesday that he disagreed with the president. “It’s a factor,” Dimon said. “But it may not be the deciding factor” in whether the US economy keeps growing. CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report.",left
"Texas Gov. Abbott says he’ll ‘impose 100% tariff’ on New Yorkers who move in Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) wrote on the eve of Election Day that he would impose tariffs on any New Yorker who moves to Texas after voting ended. “After the polls close tomorrow night, I will impose a 100% tariff on anyone moving to Texas from NYC,” Abbott posted on social platform X. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for more information from NewsNation, The Hill’s sister network, on how those tariffs would work. The power to impose tariffs falls within the federal government’s authority in the Constitution, not the states. The race for New York City mayor has been closely watched nationally. President Trump endorsed independent candidate Andrew Cuomo on Truth Social. Trump’s endorsement read in part, “Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, [Zohran] Mamdani is not!” Mamdani is the front-runner in the mayoral race based on polling on Oct. 29 from Quinnipiac University. Polling suggested Mamdani had a lead with 43 percent, followed by Cuomo with 33 percent and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa with 14 percent. Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

"Households face unexpected rise in energy prices in new year - Published Millions of households will see a slight rise in energy prices in the depths of winter, after regulator Ofgem outlined its next price cap. The 0.2% increase from the current cap will take effect at the start of January, and affect those on variable tariffs in England, Wales and Scotland. The rise was a surprise after forecasters suggested the cap may fall at the start of the year. Government policy is primarily behind the shift. Gas and electricity bills remain relatively high, and the sudden drop in temperature has brought the costs to the forefront of people's minds. ""While wholesale energy costs are stabilising, they still make up the largest portion of our bills which leaves us open to volatile prices,"" said Tim Jarvis, from Ofgem. Rising electricity unit rates are behind the latest change, offset by a slight fall in gas rates. So, heavy users of electricity will see the biggest impact. Prices will be slightly lower than the same period the previous year, but Mr Jarvis said the cap was a backstop and people could take action - such as shopping around for a fixed tariff - to reduce their bill. Ofgem said the price cap change was driven by government policy costs and operating costs, such as funding the Sizewell C nuclear project which adds Â£1 a month to a typical bill. The cap sets the maximum price for each unit of gas and electricity, not the total bill - so those who use more energy, pay more. The Ofgem cap is illustrated with a household using a ""typical"" amount of 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. This household would see a Â£3 rise in its annual bill from Â£1,755 to Â£1,758. However, the amount used varies significantly between households, so the best way to calculate the change is to work out the percentage change from your own usual annual bill. Standing charges - the fixed costs that cover the cost of running the network as well as government levies - will rise by 2% for electricity and 3% for gas. Dame Clare Moriarty from Citizens Advice said: ""With bills still drastically higher than before the energy crisis, and due to rise again from April, it's high time for decisions about the longer term."" At St Nicholas Church in Maidstone, Kent, there is a community hub for parents and toddlers in one room, and a get together over tea and cake for the older generation in another. Liz Walker, one of the organisers of the morning cafe, said small changes had helped everyone with the cost of energy. ""We are into winter now and we open the doors earlier, as we have for the last three years, because it means some people won't have to put their heating on for the whole morning."" Debt worries Charities say they are seeing people owing increasing levels of unpaid bills and charges to suppliers. The total amount owed has reached a record Â£4.4bn, prompting plans from Ofgem to ensure energy companies write off some of that debt. Up to Â£500m could be knocked off the total under plans the regulator wants to take effect next year. Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said anyone facing difficulties paying should contact their energy provider as soon as possible. ""We know that far too many people are struggling to pay for the energy they need to use,"" she said. But she added suppliers could help with efficient appliances, more tailored tariffs or ensuring people were on the correct benefits. Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, which had expected the cap to fall, said Ofgem's announcement marked ""the beginning of a potential trend"" in which the main driver of higher bills would be government policies as opposed to higher wholesale energy prices. Principal consultant Dr Craig Lowrey said households faced bills rising further in April due to the costs of running the energy network and transitioning to net zero. But he added: ""A low carbon system means more energy security and less exposure to the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices."" The government has hinted at extra cost-of-living support in next week's Budget. One option said to be under consideration is removing VAT from energy bills, which would cut about Â£80 from annual bills. Dr Lowrey said any support would be ""zero-sum"" as ""these costs will still need to be recovered, whether through bills or through taxes, as the pipes, wires, and networks that keep the lights on still need investment as we move to a cleaner, more secure energy system"". Energy Minister Martin McCluskey said energy bills ""remain too high"", but that the government was taking action, with ""millions more families receiving Â£150 off their bills through the expanded Warm Home Discount scheme"". But the Conservatives said Labour's net zero policies were ""making energy unaffordable"". Shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho said: ""Ed Miliband promised to cut everyone's energy bills by Â£300 but more and more experts are sounding the alarm that his plans will lock us into paying higher bills for decades.""

"Brazil's Supreme Court has ruled that former president Jair Bolsonaro's coup conviction was final, with no more appeals allowed, clearing the way for him to begin serving a 27-year sentence. Bolsonaro, aged 70, was in September convicted over a scheme to stop leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after the 2022 elections, and that included an assassination plot. The Supreme Court rejected an appeal to his sentence earlier this month, and ruled the judgment was now final. The former army captain who fired up Brazil's conservatives to become president in 2019 and reshaped the country's politics will now have to serve the lengthy jail term. Bolsonaro had been under house arrest until Saturday, when he was detained at police headquarters in the capital Brasilia for tampering with his ankle monitor using a soldering iron. Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes said there had been ""very serious indications of a possible attempt to flee"" during a planned vigil organised by Bolsonaro's son outside his home. The justice pointed to the location of the nearby US embassy, and Bolsonaro's close relationship with US President Donald Trump, suggesting he may have tried to escape to seek political asylum. During a hearing on Sunday in Brasilia, Bolsonaro stated he ""experienced a certain paranoia between Friday and Saturday due to medication"", according to a Supreme Court document obtained by AFP. He also asserted ""that he had no intention of fleeing and that there was no breakage of the bracelet's strap"". In a video made public by the court on Saturday, Bolsonaro gave a different version of events: he said he had used a soldering iron on the monitoring bracelet out of ""curiosity"". Shortly before Bolsonaro tampered with the device, his lawyers had petitioned the court to allow him to serve out his sentence at home due to ill health.

"Guinness owner Diageo cut its sales and profit forecasts today, tipping its shares to a decade-low, as the world's top spirits maker left investors hanging on who its permanent CEO will be. Stubbornly low sales in the US and China, two crucial spirits markets where consumer confidence is low or their spending stretched, are punishing the maker of Johnnie Walker whisky and Smirnoff vodka along with its rivals. ""There's much more for us to do, and we need to go faster,"" said interim CEO Nik Jhangiani after Diageo's first quarter trading update, adding the performance was unsatisfactory. Diageo is attempting to cut costs and sell assets as the drinks industry faces cooling post-pandemic demand, tariff-related uncertainty and shifting consumer habits. Shares in Diageo slipped 5.3% to levels last seen in 2015, compounding an almost 30% fall so far this year. Jhangiani, who stepped in after the abrupt exit of former Diageo CEO Debra Crew in July, previously said he expected a decision on a permanent replacement by the end of October. But the company did not provide an update today. Cranley Macfarlane, deputy chief investment officer at Diageo investor Church House Investments, said this raised questions over why Jhangiani has not been confirmed in the CEO role on a permanent basis, as some had expected. Others said it also raised doubts over strategy. ""There is a plan in place which is going in the right direction, but whether a new CEO has a different view and a different strategy, no one will know until a permanent CEO is in place,"" said Richard Scrope, manager of the VT Tyndall Global Select Fund, which also holds Diageo stock. Diageo said it now expects 2026 sales to be flat or slightly lower with only low to mid single-digit operating profit growth. It had earlier forecast annual sales performance similar to last year, when sales grew 1.7%, along with mid single-digit operating profit growth in 2026. The decision to revise the outlook came despite a better-than-expected, albeit flat, first-quarter sales performance. Diageo flagged a double-digit decline in sales in China, driven by a drop in consumption of national spirit baijiu. Meanwhile, in the US, its sales fell 4.1% with a steep drop in tequilas such as Don Julio, which has been a critical growth engine for Diageo.",centre
"European companies that make products from copper have warned they are facing critical shortages unless the EU takes action to curb exports of scrap, as it has for aluminium. Large amounts of refined copper have been shipped to the US by investors attracted by higher prices there based on tariff expectations. At the same time, exports of copper scrap from the EU have surged by 31% since 2022, with about half going to China, according to a position paper issued by companies accounting for more than 90% of European copper scrap usage. ""What makes me nervous is there's a high risk of a cathode shortage in Europe next year,"" said Uwe Schmidt, an executive at German metal products producer Wieland. ""Scrap shortage and cathode shortage will be a dangerous mixture for the semi-fabricators,"" he said. Cathodes are slabs of refined copper and fabricators use copper to produce a variety of semi-finished products such as wire, tubes and rods. The European Commission earlier this week announced plans to restrict EU exports of scrap aluminium to stop the metal flooding out of the bloc. It would be logical for the EU to do the same for the copper industry, Schmidt said. The companies named in the industry paper also included Aurubis, ElvalHalcor and La Farga.",centre
"The United States and Britain have announced a deal to secure zero tariffs on British pharmaceutical products and medical technology in return for Britain spending more on medicines and overhauling how it values drugs. Under the agreement, Britain will raise the net price it pays for new US medicines by 25%. In return, UK-made medicines, drug ingredients and medical technology will be exempt from Section 232 sectoral tariffs and any future Section 301 country tariffs. ""The United States and the United Kingdom announce this negotiated outcome pricing for innovative pharmaceuticals, which will help drive investment and innovation in both countries,"" United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement. The agreement means Britain will be exempted from hefty US tariffs imposed on pharma imports that went into effect on 1 October. The deal includes a significant change to the value appraisal framework at NICE, which is the UK body that determines whether new drugs are cost-effective for the NHS. NICE's ""quality-adjusted life year"" threshold, currently £30,000 per year, will rise to £35,000. The British government said the change to NICE would let it ""keep pace with the commercial and economic environment in which pharmaceutical companies are operating in today."" The revised framework will apply to all new medicines, not just US drugs, but will not affect prices of existing treatments. NICE has often rejected coverage of new, expensive drugs through the NHS, for example Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's drug and AstraZeneca's breast cancer treatment Enhertu. British pharmaceutical industry group ABPI said the deal would help British patients access new medicines and help attract investment from drugmakers. Shares in UK-based drugmakers GSK and AstraZeneca were broadly unchanged on the agreement. The UK is a very small market for the pharmaceutical industry, making up just 2% of AstraZeneca's total revenue for instance. GSK welcomed the deal, saying ""these good foundations, offer a real opportunity to secure the UK as an attractive global-leading environment for life sciences that rewards long-term innovation."" US President Donald Trump has pressed Britain and the rest of Europe to pay more for American medicines, part of his push for US medicine costs to be brought more in line with those paid in other wealthy nations. The industry has criticised a tough operating environment in Britain and some major firms have cancelled or paused investment in Britain, including AstraZeneca, the largest firm on the London Stock Exchange by market value. One point of contention between the sector and the government has been the operation of a voluntary pricing scheme which sees firms put a proportion of sales to the NHS back into the health service. The office of the USTR said Britain had committed that the rebate rate would decrease to 15% in 2026. The breakthrough comes after the two countries agreed in May to seek ""significantly preferential treatment outcomes on pharmaceuticals"", with a commitment that Britain tries to improve the environment for pharma firms operating in the country. It concludes talks on a major unresolved issue after Britain became the first country to secure tariff relief on some other sectors in May. The European Union and US agreed a trade deal in July that capped tariffs on exports on pharmaceuticals, and most other goods, from the EU at 15%.",centre
"European leaders flocked to Angola this week to strike deals and deepen cooperation with their African counterparts, as global tensions mount. ""Africa and Europe are partners of choice, bound by common interests and priorities and shared values,"" EU Council President António Costa posted on social media before the EU-African Union (AU) Summit kicked off on Monday. ""In a turbulent world, our commitment to build a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable future - and to defend multilateralism - must guide our actions,"" he wrote. Of course, Africa and Europe were not always partners of choice. For much of modern history, European nations conquered and plundered the continent, seizing its abundant natural resources for their own enrichment. As delegates gathered in the capital, Luanda, the country had just celebrated 50 years since gaining independence from Portugal. For the previous 400 years, Portugal had ruled over the oil and diamond-rich nation, which by the 19th Century, was the largest source of slaves for the Americas. A brutal 40-year civil war followed independence and today, Angola remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. Landmine victims can be seen on the streets of the capital. Despite the country’s enormous wealth, little of it appears to trickle down. ""We earn less than a hundred US dollars a month,"" one Luanda tour operator told RTÉ News. Asked can you live on that here, he answered: ""We don’t live, we survive"". He was hopeful about the Europeans being in town. ""There needs to be more investment here,"" he said, ""instead of the money going overseas"". Today, Africa’s natural resources are once again very much in demand. The continent is home to more than half of the world’s cobalt reserves - essential for rechargeable batteries, wind turbines and even some nuclear weapons. There are also vast reserves of copper, lithium and manganese. And then there are Africa's human resources. As populations in Europe and Asia tip into decline, Africa’s is set to grow. It will be home to a quarter of the world’s people in 2050 and top four billion by century’s end. ""I think the potential, if you look two to three decades ahead, is Africa,"" Taoiseach Micheál Martin said as the AU-EU Summit began, ""in terms of population growth, in terms of the importance of what will be a significant economic market in time"". The European Union is still the biggest market for African countries, he said. ""So, it is very important to have a structured, sustainable, respectful and mutually beneficial relationship with Africa,"" he added. Europe, still reeling from the US trade tariffs and China’s export control on critical minerals, wants to shore up its supply chain resilience. ""I believe there has been less progress than the EU hoped for,"" Adrian Joseph from the South African Institute of International Affairs said. While European and African nations have struck deals on critical minerals - the most recent on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Johannesburg last week - the roadmaps that accompany them are not publicly available, he said. ""This makes is difficult to assess progress,"" he said, adding ""a lack of transparency around these agreements is naturally not only an implementation problem, but also an accountability issue"". For Africa, there remains a risk of exploitation, Mr Joseph said. ""In the absence of any serious reforms, there is a real risk that the extraction of the critical minerals needed to power the energy transition could occur at the expense of citizens and the environment in African countries,"" he added. However, African leaders were clear in their demands. In return for supplying Europe with critical minerals, they want the EU to open up its market. In his address to the summit, Chairperson of the AU Commission Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said: ""We are calling for more balanced trade partnerships. ""I’m pleading for European investments in the transformation process of our minerals on the continent. ""I’m calling for the lifting of any tariff hampering the access of African products to the European market."" Of course, in eyeing up Africa’s natural wealth, Europe is not alone. ""There are other interests involved in Africa,"" Mr Martin told reporters, ""including Russia and China"". Indeed, China has been investing heavily in the continent for decades. More than 50 African countries signed up to China's leader Xi Jinping’s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure development project. Luanda’s gleaming new international airport, for example, is Chinese-built. Now with so much interest flowing from wealthy nations, African governments could be in a position to choose the best deals, analysts said. ""It is about which partners can provide the best value proposition to African countries seeking investments in their mining sectors, as these countries are not eager to become entangled in the geopolitical tensions between the US and China,"" Mr Joseph said.",centre
"The European Commission has recalled consignments of frozen Brazilian beef products imported into the EU, after it was found they contained hormones banned in the bloc. The banned hormones were detected in shipments that arrived into Europe earlier this month. Authorities in a number of countries have removed affected products from sale, and issued recalls where necessary. EU countries impacted by the situation include Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Slovakia. The United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) is also among the countries affected. The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) has said the recalls of Brazilian beef raise questions about controls in Brazil. IFA President Francie Gorman said they ""raise very significant concerns around the lack of robust controls in slaughterhouses in Brazil, which has allowed hormone beef to enter the EU and be sold to European citizens"". He added the findings ""have to be a serious wake-up call for the bureaucrats and cheerleaders attempting to usher through a Mercosur trade deal for the benefit of big industry at the expense of European farmers and the health and wellbeing of EU citizens"". It comes after a recent investigation from the Irish Farmers Journal, which claimed to have been able to buy animal antibiotics in Brazil without prescriptions, and hormones banned in the EU. The European Commission is pushing for the ratification of Mercosur, which would create the world's biggest free-trade zone and significantly increase EU exports to Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Mercosur countries would be able to export up to 99,000 tonnes of beef into the EU at a much-reduced tariff rate of 7.5%, as well as 180,000 tonnes of poultry. Several EU member states, notably Ireland and France, are opposed to its ratification, citing the potential to massively distort key agricultural markets.",centre
"UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell has said all populations and all economies need to get results from the COP30 climate talks, but added time is running out. He was speaking as the climate negotiations in Belém, Brazil, have reached the halfway mark. Mr Stiell hinted at impasses over critical issues such as providing climate finance and transitioning away from fossil fuels, and urged the negotiators to push further to find compromises. With government ministers, including Ireland's Minister for Climate Daragh O'Brien, arriving in Belém before Monday, the focus is about to shift from technical drafting of proposed agreements and declarations to tricky high-stakes diplomacy and decision-making. Energy, finance, climate adaptation and climate ambition will be the key battlegrounds. Mr Stiell has hinted strongly about log jams and stalled progress on key issues which could include climate finance, transparency, ambition, and matters that impact on international trade. He appealed last night to the negotiators to make it as easy as possible for governments to compromise by pushing themselves further and sticking to the painstaking yet crucial work behind the scenes. Mr Stiell said certain climate issue that are not a priority for some countries are clearly issues and priorities for others. He added that the negotiating process must deliver strong results. That requires listening to and understanding the issues that matter most to other nations and groups, he said. He told the negotiators from 194 countries, plus the EU, that if they do not align and find common ground on issues important to others, then COP30 will not deliver outcomes that show the Paris Climate Agreement is working. He asked them to seek out and find each other in hallways to iron out their difficulties. ""It is not clear if every national negotiating team is prepared to be at the table discussing the critical issues, but the negotiations need to get past this point quickly,"" he said. Mr Stiell said that the prospect of a hotter, poorer and less healthy world, along with the human and economic losses caused by climate change, strongly underscores just how important it is for COP30 to achieve a good outcome. Earlier, the Executive Secretary had appealed to the parties negotiating to make progress in relation to the provision of climate finance for poorer countries. Mr Stiell said such assistance is the life blood of climate action. ""It is what turns climate plans into progress and climate ambition into implementation. He reiterated that providing climate finance is not an act of charity by rich nations. Rather, he said, it is smart economics, because climate action, underpinned by climate finance, is the growth story of the 21st century. When climate finance is made available, ambition grows. It enables climate plans to be implemented, which creates jobs, reduces the cost of living, improves health, protects communities, and secures a prosperous and more resilient planet for all. Prominent Climate Scientist Katherine Hayhoe, who is the Chief Scientist at The Nature Conservancy, and speaker on behalf of Nature4Climate, a global coalition of environmental organisations, said COP30 has lived up to its promise of being an implementation cop during its first week. She said she was pleased to hear indigenous voices at the negotiating table, and to see the role of nature take centre stage in climate solutions. Ms Hayhoe was referring to initiatives such as the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, launched by the Brazilian COP30 Presidency in the first few days. She described this facility as a potential game-changer for curbing deforestation. It aims to raise €125 billion per year to reward countries for preserving rainforests like the Amazon. The idea is to ensure a hectare of rainforest will always be worth more than a hectare of land cleared for farming. This will ensure that any incentive to cut down the trees is removed. Two days after it was announced, the Tropical Forest Forever Facility had attracted commitments of $5.5 billion in funding from Norway, Brazil, France, Germany, China and others. Ireland did not invest. Taoiseach Micheál Martin described it as ""interesting"" and said his Government will assess it. Week one of COP30 has seen unprecedented attention paid to climate misinformation and efforts to ensure people have accurate and factual information for responsible decisions. However, there is no guarantee that week two will run as smoothly. The outcome depends critically on how ministers and negotiators tackle the continued global reliance on fossil fuels. Melissa, a Category 5 hurricane, tore through the Caribbean, severely impacting Jamaica just three days before the COP30 leaders' summit. The Philippines was also hit by its second major typhoon in a single week. Heat waves, floods, wildfires and droughts are becoming more severe and putting more people at risk every single year. Ms Hayhoe said a strong outcome to the Belém climate talks would send a powerful signal of solidarity and hope to the communities on the front lines of climate change. Every line in the draft COP30 text represents lives, livelihoods and ecosystems. There are some very tricky issues for government ministers to deal with in week two the negotiations. The obligation of developed countries to provide finance for poorer countries is certainly one. Another concerns issues around trade and the potential consequences of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism for international trade rules. Such a mechanism could also significantly disadvantage already vulnerable poorer nations trying to export into bigger markets. For them, a carbon border price adjustment imposed on their products might be akin to a tariff. There is also the issue of transparency and building trust, within and between countries about climate measures and climate actions that we are told are being implemented. It is one thing for a country to give certain commitments in response to international climate targets. It is quite another for them to live up to those promises, commitment and turn them into action. This focus on transparency issues over the coming week will shift the international climate policy focus from simply registering and recording national climate pledges to a focus on monitoring and policing the implementation of climate commitments. This is a fundamental shift. It is key to ensuring that COP30 is truly an implementation COP as has been promised by Brazil's President Lula.",centre
"World champions South Africa beat Ireland 24-13 at the Aviva Stadium to claim their first win in Dublin since 2012. Andy Farrell's side had four players sent to the sin-bin and James Ryan was red-carded. Here's how we rated the players on a tough night for the hosts. 15. Mack Hansen – 7 Battled hard but didn't get a decent share of the high balls, succumbed to injury late on. Made a good run early on that came to nothing. Carried six times for over 20 metres, looks at home at full-back. 14. Tommy O’Brien - 6 Hustled hard and was hit hard by the ravenous Springboks. The tackle from Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu that was deemed just a penalty should have had a higher tariff. Failed his head injury assessment before half-time after giving away a penalty. 13. Garry Ringrose – 7 Met fire with fire in the midfield but was starved of much in the way of quality ball. Carried 10 times for some hard yards, missed a couple of tackles but not alone. 12. Bundee Aki – 6 Ireland needed more of an impact from their most physical back, who made over nine metres off seven carries. However, has to be noted that he had to pack down on the side of the scrum for most of the game. 11. James Lowe – 7 Ireland’s top carrier with 12. The winger broke free a couple of times and drew multiple defenders otherwise. Was first on the scene before Tadhg Beirne’s disallowed try. Got blocked down as Ireland chased late on and had Jack Crowley to thank for preventing a try. 10. Sam Prendergast – 6.5 A mixed game for the out-half and he paid the price for a series of offside penalties at the end of the first half. Missed a kickable penalty that indirectly led to James Ryan’s red card but landed a more difficult one in the second half. Missed just one of 12 tackle attempts. 9. Jamison Gibson-Park – 7 Didn’t get much to work with due to the scrum issues. Did very well to clear his lines under pressure a couple of times. Won’t be happy with his tackle for South Africa’s only try of the second half. Beautiful assist pass for Ireland’s try. 1. Andrew Porter – 5.5 Understandable as it was, the Irish scrum was demolished. Porter gave away four penalties and was sent to the bin. Made a couple of big carries early on and 11 tackles. 2. Dan Sheehan – 6.5 Took his try very well, powering over from close range. However, Ireland’s lineout was again an issue, admittedly under pressure. 3. Tadhg Furlong – 6 Not a day for the Irish front row and Furlong missed three tackles as well. Battled away but the 'bread and butter’ as Andy Farrell might say, wasn’t covered. 4. James Ryan – 4 Started with intent and won a turnover. Can’t have any real complaints about his red card, which was upgraded from yellow after a bunker review. Ireland needed him for more than 20 minutes. 5. Tadhg Beirne – 6 Beirne was quite by his own standards as Ireland were largely in fire-fighting mode. Racked up nine tackles and had a turnover to his name but also conceded two penalties. 6. Ryan Baird – 7 One of Ireland’s better performers. Made a big tackle, one of nine, on Jasper Wiese that resulted in a turnover close to the line. Limped off near the end after another big shift. Took three lineouts. 7. Josh van der Flier – 7 Started off like a man with a point to prove and left everything out there. Must have been hard to know if he was coming or going with the amount of enforced switches Ireland had to make. Made 12 tackles. 8. Caelan Doris – 7.5 The captain was Ireland’s top tackler with 14. Constantly put himself in harm’s way and did his best to put Ireland on the front foot. Made nine carries but the stats show he conceded three turnovers. Great to have him back after a lengthy layoff before November. Replacements. 16. Rónan Kelleher (for Sheehan 56) – 6 Made a nice hit on Leinster team-mate RG Snyman. 17. Paddy McCarthy (for Van der Flier, 40-49, and for Porter, 60-70) – 7.5 Made a immediate impact after coming on, credited with two turnovers. Big find for Ireland in this window. Was yellow carded but who wasn’t? 18. Finlay Bealham (for Furlong 60) – 6 Made himself available to carry plenty of ball. 19. Cian Prendergast (for Ryan (red card) 39 ) – 7.5 Took four lineouts and busied himself when called earlier than expected. Knock on led to South Africa's fourth try but otherwise did very well. 20. Jack Conan (for Baird 60) – 6.5 Tried hard to make an impact. 21. Craig Casey (for Ringrose 72) – 6 Did his best to get something going. 22. Jack Crowley (for O’Brien 32 HIA) – 5.5 Saved a couple of tries with scramble defence but yellow carded for an effort that he was never going to get away with. 23.

"This year is on track to be the second or third warmest globally as an ""unprecedented streak"" of high temperatures continues, UN scientists have warned. Global average surface temperatures in January to August 2025 were 1.42C above pre-industrial levels, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said, a slight drop from the record highs of 1.55C in 2024. As world leaders gather in Belém, Brazil, for the latest round of UN climate talks, the WMO said it was ""virtually impossible"" to curb global warming to the agreed limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in the next few years without temporarily overshooting the target. But it is ""still entirely possible and essential"" to bring temperatures down to the 1.5C goal by the end of the century, WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo said. Watch: More leaders need to 'tell it as it is' om climate, Taoiseach tells COP30 The latest UN talks come in the wake of a year in which people around the world have been battered by climate and weather extremes from damaging rainfall and floods to severe heat and wildfire - but as politicians in a number of countries seek to row back on action to combat the worsening situation. This year has been slightly cooler than last year as the El Niño climate phenomenon in the tropical Pacific, which boosted global temperatures in 2023 and 2024, shifted to neutral conditions at the start of 2025. The El Niño/La Niña pattern influences the global climate in addition to the warming caused by humans burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests, which put heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, pushing up temperatures and sea levels and causing more extreme weather. The WMO's analysis finds that the past 11 years - from 2015, when countries signed up to the Paris Agreement to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C to avoid its worst impacts, to 2025 - are individually the 11 warmest on record. The past three years have been the three warmest years in the record stretching back 176 years, the WMO said. The UN's meteorological agency also warned that concentrations of greenhouse gases, which reached record levels in 2024, continued to rise in 2025. Ms Saulo said: ""This unprecedented streak of high temperatures, combined with last year's record increase in greenhouse gas levels, makes it clear that it will be virtually impossible to limit global warming to 1.5C in the next few years without temporarily overshooting this target. ""But the science is equally clear that it's still entirely possible and essential to bring temperatures back down to 1.5C by the end of the century."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned: ""Each year above 1.5C will hammer economies, deepen inequalities and inflict irreversible damage. ""We must act now, at great speed and scale, to make the overshoot as small, as short, and as safe as possible - and bring temperatures back below 1.5C before the end of the century."" He said it could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions of people to un-livable conditions, and amplify threats to peace and security. ""Every fraction of a degree means more hunger, displacement, and loss – especially for those least responsible. This is moral failure – and deadly negligence,"" he said. Watch: Guterres says political courage is needed to transition to clean energy He said the United Nations will not give up on the 1.5 degrees goal and that we have never been better equipped to fight back. He spoke about the clean energy revolution with solar and wind, now the cheapest sources of power, and the fastest growing sources of electricity in history. In 2024, investors poured 2 trillion US dollars into clean energy – 800 billion more than fossil fuels. ""Clean energy is winning on price, performance, and potential – offering the solutions to transform our economies and protect our populations. What's still missing is political courage"", he said. ""Fossil fuels still command vast subsidies – taxpayers’ money. Too many corporations are making record profits from climate devastation – with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress. Too many leaders remain captive to these entrenched interests. Too many countries are starved of the resources to adapt – and locked out of the clean energy transition,"" he added. In an update to its annual state of the climate report timed to coincide with the start of the UN Cop30 talks in Brazil, the WMO highlighted that ocean heat continued to rise in 2025 above the record levels seen in 2024, with impacts including damage to natural systems, intensifying storms, accelerating sea ice loss and sea level rises. Long term rates of sea level rise have doubled, and 2024 set a new record for annual global average sea levels, though it has dropped slightly since 2025 in what the experts said is likely temporary behaviour. The WMO highlighted too that Arctic sea ice was at its lowest levels on record for the time of year after the winter freeze, while Antarctic sea ice was the third lowest on record for its annual minimum and maximum extents. Concentrations of three key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, were at record highs in 2024 and measurements from individual locations suggest they will be even higher in 2025. In response to the report, Gareth Redmond-King, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think tank said: ""Nations are gathering for the start of the COP30 climate summit at the end of a year that has seen devastating hurricanes, wildfires and flooding across the world; here at home, we've seen the second worst harvest as a result of climate change."" He said that news that 2025 was set to be the second or third hottest on record, alongside warnings that current pledges of climate action still put the world on track for dangerous levels of temperature rise ""should focus leaders' minds"". ""Net zero emissions is the only solution we have to halt climate change, to limit the worsening danger and rising costs which this represents, and bring the climate system back into balance."" Lula warns world leaders of 'extremist forces' lying about climate President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of COP30 host Brazil said that ""extremist forces"" were condemning future generations to life on a planet forever altered by global warming. Mr Lula lashed out at ""extremist forces (that) fabricate fake news ... to obtain electoral gains and imprison future generations,"" as he warned that the window to prevent calamitous climate change was ""closing rapidly"". Mr Lula pointed to a recent UN report that found Earth will likely be 2.5C warmer by 2100 from pre-industrial levels. This would claim an estimated 250,000 lives per year and shrink global GDP by almost a third, he told dozens of leaders gathered in Belem. ""Now is the moment ... to face reality and decide if we will have the courage and the necessary determination to transform things,"" the president urged. But he pointed to a tendency of ""selfish immediate interests"" prevailing over the long-term common good. Global climate efforts have been tarnished by ""insecurity and mutual mistrust,"" said Mr Lula, who has been involved in a heated tariff spat with counterpart Donald Trump of the United States, which was absent from the high-level climate talks. Brazil president launches forest fund at climate summit Mr Lula launched a fund today to protect the world's forests, key absorbers of planet-warming carbon. In what Mr Lula dubbed ""one of the main tangible outcomes"" expected from the gathering, the so-called Tropical Forest Forever Facility is meant to gather investments of $125bn from governments and private investors in the long term, with startup funding of $10bn that has not yet been received. ""When forest destruction reaches irreversible points, its effects will be felt across the world. Forests are worth more standing than cut down. They should be part of the GDP of our countries,"" said Mr Lula.

"China's exports fell in October for the first time in eight months, official data showed today, as trade tensions flared in the weeks before Chinese President Xi Jinping met US counterpart Donald Trump. Shipments dropped 1.1% year on year, missing a Bloomberg forecast of a 2.9% rise. Imports in the same month rose 1%, China's General Administration of Customs said. That was also well off September's reading and short of the 2.7% climb estimated in the Bloomberg forecast. China and the US reached a detente in their trade war after Xi and Trump met in South Korea at the end of October. That put a precarious pause on months of tit-for-tat measures between the economic and technological powerhouses as the leaders agreed to suspend a raft of measures for a year. Beijing last month announced fresh restrictions on exports of rare earth technologies, a sector it dominates and is critical to defence and auto manufacturers. Trump retaliated by threatening an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods. However, that warning was called off after Xi and Trump met last month in South Korea, with the US leader calling their first encounter since 2019 a ""great success"". Washington halved a blanket tariff on Chinese goods to 10%, while Beijing loosened restrictions on rare earth exports of rare earths, also providing relief to European businesses. China also lifted extra tariffs on US agricultural products including soybeans, critical to American farmers who are a key part of Trump's base. China's imports from the United States fell 11.6% month-on-month in October, the customs data showed, while its shipments in the other direction rose 1.8%. Chinese exporters had been ""frontloading their trade in order to avoid high tariffs in the US"", Zhiwei Zhang, economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note. The country's shipments to the US jumped by 8.6% in September from August after falling by 11.8% from July. ""It seems the frontloading finally faded in October. As the trade war is put on hold for one year, exports will likely normalise,"" Zhang said. ""Now that export momentum weakens, China needs to rely more on domestic demand,"" he warned",centre
"South Korean car giant Hyundai Motor Group has pledged today an unprecedented $85.8 billion investment in the country over the next five years, a move that comes on the heels of Seoul's trade deal with Washington. Hyundai called it ""the company's largest-ever domestic investment commitment"". ""A significant portion of the investment will focus on new businesses based on advanced AI technologies, such as robotics, contributing to the development of Korea's AI and Robotics innovation ecosystem,"" the company said in a press release. The roadmap ""highlights the Group's agility in actively responding to the rapidly changing global business environment"", it added. Around 40% of the total spending will go into developing ""AI, software defined vehicles (SDVs), electrification, robotics, and hydrogen"", the company said. It added that the investment would help boost exports of South Korea-made vehicles by 13% to 2.47 million units by 2030. The announcement follows a similar pledge by Samsung Group, another major conglomerate whose flagship firm is Samsung Electronics, which vowed to invest $310 billion over the same time, largely in artificial intelligence technologies. Samsung Electronics is already one of the world's top memory-chip makers, providing crucial components for the AI industry and the infrastructure it relies on. Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Kia, sold more than 7.2 million vehicles last year in South Korea and overseas combined. The investment commitments follow Seoul's conclusion of a new trade deal with Washington, under which South Korean exports, including Hyundai vehicles, will face a reduced tariff rate of 15%, down from 25%. But the new rate still remains significantly higher than the previous 2.5% applied under an existing free trade pact.",centre
"US presses Europe on rules for big tech companies - Published Europe should ""reconsider"" its rules for big tech companies if it wants to see lower US tariff rates on its steel and aluminium exports, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said. His comments come as officials from the US and European Union are meeting in Brussels to discuss the status of the trade framework that the two sides agreed in July. That deal set US tariff rates on European products at 15%, lower than had been threatened, in exchange for promises of European investment and changes that would allow in more American agricultural products. But the two sides remain at odds over some parts of the deal. European officials hoped they would secure relief for their metals exports as part of the deal reached over the summer, but the US is still charging at 50% duty - and has expanded the number of products subject to the levy. Europe is also hoping to win carve-outs from tariffs for items such as wine, cheese and pasta, similar to the rollback the Trump administration recently granted for tropical fruit and coffee. In an update to reporters on the talks, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the US wanted to see Europe follow through on promises to lower tariffs on American goods before it would grant exemptions. He and Mr Lutnick said the US wanted to see concessions over European rules for tech companies in exchange for changes to metals tariffs. ""They would like to have steel and aluminium as part of this package and we think it is very, very important that they understand our digital companies and they reconsider their digital regulations to be more inviting to our big companies,"" Mr Lutnick said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. The US has long maintained that taxes on digital services - which typically charge levies on revenue from streaming or digital advertising companies above a certain size - unfairly target American firms. US firms have also been unhappy with Europe's Digital Markets Act, which came into force last year. It was aimed at boosting competition, for example setting rules that would require a company like Apple to make its iPhones work with devices such as headphones made by other brands. When Trump was re-elected last year, many tech firms hoped he would champion a fight over the rules and taxes, unlike the Biden administration, which was seen as leaving such battles up to the firms involved. European officials have previously said that its digital rules were not up for negotiation. European Trade Commissioner MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU had maintained that stance when the issue arose on Monday. ""This is not discriminatory. It is not aimed at American companies,"" he added.",centre
"Sony has today raised its operating profit forecast for the year ending March 2026 by 8% to 1.43 trillion yen ($9.5 billion), citing a smaller-than-expected impact from US tariffs and the strength of its entertainment and chips businesses. Operating profit in the July-September quarter climbed 10% to 429 billion yen after its music unit, which includes anime, and chips businesses recorded higher sales. Sony cited the success of animated movie ""Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle"" as a contributor. The Japanese conglomerate was once best known for household electronics but has become an entertainment powerhouse and is banking on the growth of anime. Profit at Sony's games business fell in the second quarter as the company booked impairment losses related to the ""Destiny 2"" video game. User engagement has not met the expectations Sony had when it bought Bungie, a studio, Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao said at a briefing. Sony sold 3.9 million units of its PlayStation 5, which launched in 2020, during the quarter in a slight increase from the same time a year earlier. ""We plan to expand the install base during the year-end sales season while continuing to balance that expansion with the profitability of the entire segment,"" Tao said. Take-Two Interactive said last week it has delayed the release of ""Grand Theft Auto VI"" for a second time to November next year. The highly anticipated title is expected to boost Sony's PlayStation business as customers upgrade their consoles or buy specialised gaming hardware for the first time. Sony said it has sold 3.3 million units of ""Ghost of Yotei"", which launched last month and has been well received. Nintendo last week hiked its annual sales forecast for the Switch 2 to 19 million units as consumers flock to the gaming device which launched in June. Sony, a leading manufacturer of image sensors used in smartphones, cited sales of larger sensors as boosting its chips unit during the quarter. Customers may have brought forward purchases due to tariffs and other factors, Sony said. Sony said it sees a 50 billion yen hit from tariffs during the financial year, compared to the 70 billion yen impact estimate in August. The company said it would buy back up to 35 million shares for some 100 billion yen. Sony's shares closed up 5.5% following the earnings release.",centre
"US Supreme Court justices has raised doubts over the legality of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs in a case with implications for the global economy that marks a major test of Mr Trump's powers. Both conservative and liberal justices sharply questioned the lawyer representing Mr Trump's administration about whether the president had intruded on the power of Congress in imposing tariffs under a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. But some of the conservative justices also signaled that they were wrestling with their recognition of the inherent power that presidents have in dealing with foreign countries, suggesting the court could be sharply divided in the outcome of the case. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority. During arguments lasting more than two-and-a-half hours, the justices asked US Solicitor General D. John Sauer whether Mr Trump's application of this statute to impose tariffs of unlimited duration was a major action by the executive branch that would require clear congressional authorisation. Those questions related to the Supreme Court's ""major questions"" doctrine, which requires executive branch actions of vast economic and political significance to be clearly authorised by US lawmakers. The arguments came in appeals pursued by the administration after lower courts ruled that his unprecedented use of the law at issue to impose the tariffs exceeded his authority. Businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 US states, most of them Democratic-led, challenged the tariffs. The tariffs - taxes on imported goods - could add up to trillions of dollars for the United States over the next decade. Mr Trump has heaped pressure on the Supreme Court to preserve tariffs that he has leveraged as a key economic and foreign policy tool. Some of the conservative justices also asked pointed questions to the two lawyers arguing against the tariffs. Neal Katyal, representing businesses, and Benjamin Gutman, representing Oregon, one of the states involved in the case. Mr Sauer kicked off the arguments by defending the legal rationale employed by the president but immediately faced questions raising skepticism over the administration's arguments about the language and purpose of the statute at issue. Mr Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose the tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. The law allows a president to regulate commerce in a national emergency. 'Ruthless trade retaliation' Mr Sauer said Mr Trump determined that US trade deficits have brought the nation to the brink of an economic and national security catastrophe. Mr Sauer said imposition of the tariffs has helped Mr Trump negotiate trade deals, and unwinding those agreements ""would expose us to ruthless trade retaliation by far more aggressive countries and drive America from strength to failure with ruinous economic and national security consequences"". The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs. The administration has argued that IEEPA allows tariffs by authorising the president to ""regulate"" imports to address emergencies. The imposition of taxes on Americans ""has always been the core power of Congress,"" conservative Chief Justice John Roberts told Mr Sauer, adding that these tariffs seem to be raising revenue, which the Constitution contemplates as a role for Congress. Mr Trump invoked IEEPA in slapping tariffs on goods imported from individual countries to address what he called a national emergency related to US trade deficits, as well as in February as economic leverage on China, Canada and Mexico to curb the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned Mr Sauer about his argument that IEEPA's language granting presidents emergency power to ""regulate importation"" encompasses tariffs. ""Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase together 'regulate importation' has been used to confer tariff imposing authority?"" Ms Barrett asked. Mr Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, one of the many ways he has aggressively pushed the boundaries of executive authority since he returned to office in areas as varied as his crackdown on immigration, the firing of federal agency officials and domestic military deployments. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the lead-up to the arguments that if the Supreme Court rules against Mr Trump's use of IEEPA, his tariffs are expected to remain in place because the administration would switch to other legal authorities to underpin them. In fact, conservative Justice Samuel Alito asked about a different statute that has gotten less attention, known as Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, could provide an alternate basis for Mr Trump's tariffs. He has imposed some additional tariffs invoking other laws. Those are not at issue in this case. Mr Trump instigated a global trade war when he returned to the presidency in January, alienating trading partners, increasing volatility in financial markets and fueling global economic uncertainty. Mr Trump has wielded tariffs to extract concessions and renegotiate trade deals, and as a cudgel to punish countries that draw his ire on non-trade political matters.",centre
"British bootmaker Dr Martens said today its drive to scale back discounts in the US and shift production from China would help to offset the impact of trade tariffs in the coming years. The company, known for its chunky lace-up boots, has been pulling back on discounts and expanding into shoes, sandals, and bags under CEO Ije Nwokorie as it aims to return to profit growth this financial year. Dr Martens said it expected to manage around half of its tariff-related costs - forecast in the high-single-digit millions of pounds this financial year - and absorb all costs by the next fiscal year via pricing adjustments in the US and flexible product sourcing. The company has shifted its supply chain away from China, which previously accounted for 50% of its production, to Vietnam and Laos, which are subject to lower US import tariffs. The update comes amid cooling British consumer spending as shoppers await Black Friday deals and the government's budget announcement next week. ""While the marketplace remains uncertain and consumers are cautious, and our biggest trading weeks are ahead, we are confident in our plans for the year,"" said Nwokorie. Dr Martens reported an adjusted pretax loss of £9.2m for the six months to September 28, compared with a £16.6m loss a year earlier. The company also maintained its fiscal 2026 forecast. Its shares were volatile in early deals, rising as much as 3.8% before trading about 4% lower this morning.",centre
"US and UK agree zero tariffs deal on pharmaceuticals - Published The UK and the US have agreed a deal to keep tariffs on UK pharmaceutical shipments into America at zero. Under the agreement the UK will pay more for medicines through the NHS in return for a guarantee that US import taxes on pharmaceuticals made in the UK will remain at zero for three years. This is the first time the amount that the NHS pays for medicines is due to increase in more than 20 years. The deal comes after US President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs to as high as 100% on branded drug imports, one of the UK's biggest exports to the US. Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said the deal ""guarantees that UK pharmaceutical exports â worth at least Â£5bn a year - will enter the US tariff free, protecting jobs, boosting investment and paving the way for the UK to become a global hub for life sciences."" The UK exported Â£11.1bn worth of medicines to the US in the 12 months to the end of September, making up 17.4% of all goods exports in that period, according to the Department for Business and Trade. Pharmaceuticals were not included in the wave of tariffs US President Donald Trump had announced earlier this year. But he has repeatedly threatened to raise tariffs on medicines, citing concerns about America's reliance on medicines made overseas and a desire to increase manufacturing in the US. He has also argued that US consumers effectively subsidise medicines for other developed countries by paying premium prices for those drugs and pushed for other countries to pay more. Under the terms set out on Monday, the UK will increase the price threshold, at which it deems new treatments to be too expensive, by 25%. The UK will also increase the overall amount the NHS spends on medicines, with a target to increase that spending from 0.3% of GDP to 0.6% of GDP over the next 10 years. The amount drug companies must pay back to the NHS to ensure the health system does not overspend its allocated budget will be capped at 15% - last year, drug companies had to pay back more than 20%. In exchange, UK medicine exports will be protected from tariff increases for the next three years. White House spokesman Kush Desai said the agreement with the UK was a ""historic step towards ensuring that other developed countries finally pay their fair share"". The pressure from the US had intensified a long-running row in the UK between the government and the pharmaceuticals industry over drug approvals and the cost of medicines to the NHS. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in August that he was not prepared to let drug companies ""rip off"" the UK, after talks between the government and pharmaceutical firms over the cost of medicines broke down. But subsequently Science Minister Sir Patrick Vallance told the BBC he accepted that the NHS needed to spend more on medicines after seeing its spending on drugs shrink as a percentage of its budget over the last 10 years. The NHS advisory body NICE said the changes were likely to lead to an extra three to five medicines a year being approved - currently it assesses around 70 a year and approves 90% of them. It is not clear what this will cost the NHS - drugs currently account for around 10% of the health budget. But Sally Gainsbury, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the agreement could lead to an extra Â£3 billion being spent on drugs, which was ""bad news"" given how stretched budgets were. ""The extra cost will need to be fully-funded by the Treasury,"" she said, adding that it would be better to invest extra money into areas such as GP services or tackling the hospital backlog instead of new drugs. In announcing the new agreement, the UK government said it was the only country in the world to have secured a zero percent tariff rate for pharmaceutical shipments. European officials have previously said they believed their drugs exports would be protected by terms agreed over the summer, which would cap tariffs on most goods at 15%. It follows pressure on the government after the cancellation or pause of several large pharma investments in the UK over the last 18 months, as firms shift attention to the US. In mid-September, British pharmaceutical giant GSK pledged to invest $30bn (Â£22bn) in research and manufacturing in the US over the next five years. A week before GSK's US investment announcement, US pharmaceutical company Merck - which is called MSD in Europe â revealed it was scrapping its planned Â£1bn expansion of its UK operations. Shortly after, AstraZeneca also announced it was pausing a planned Â£200m investment in a Cambridge research facility. In July, AstraZeneca said it would invest $50bn on medicine manufacturing and research and development in the US. William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said he was pleased to see that the protections from US tariffs that UK officials had promised earlier this year had been delivered. ""This deal is a real win. It will promote exports, boost investment, and enhance UK competitiveness as a production and innovation base for world-leading medicines and treatments,"" he said. US pharmaceutical company Bristol Myers Squibb said it now anticipated being able to invest more than $500m over the next five years in areas including research, development and manufacturing. ""This agreement is a sign of progress and one that creates an environment conducive to our continued presence in the UK,"" chief executive Chris Boerner said. The White House had launched a formal investigation into pharmaceutical imports and their effect on national security in April, taking the first step towards tariffs. In September in a Truth Social post, Trump threatened to raise tariffs on branded drugs - a small subset of the medicine that the US imports - to 100%, but the White House did not put the plan into effect, citing negotiations with manufacturers. In announcing the agreement on Monday, US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr said Americans ""should not pay the world's highest drug costs for medicines they helped fund"". ""This agreement with the United Kingdom strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to USâUK pharmaceutical trade,"" he said in a statement.

"Irish Farmers' Association President Francie Gorman has said Tánaiste Simon Harris should clarify immediately where Fine Gael stands on the Mercosur trade deal. The banned hormones were detected in shipments that arrived into Europe earlier this month. Authorities in a number of countries have removed affected products from sale, and issued recalls where necessary. EU countries impacted by the situation include Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Slovakia. The United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) is also among the countries affected. Yesterday the IFA said the recalls of Brazilian beef raise questions about controls in Brazil. Speaking today, Mr Gorman said the recall of Brazilian beef by the EU authorities in the last month is a very serious matter for the public health of European citizens. Mr Gorman also said that farmers would be concerned to hear Fine Gael MEP Regina Doherty speak in favour of the deal on RTÉ's Today with David McCullough as ""the official position of the Irish Government has been that it is working to oppose the deal."" He said that ""Regina Doherty made a great play of the work under way on safeguards, but this latest revelation shows they are redundant. ""The so-called safeguards make no reference to public health. The findings of the investigation carried out by the IFA and the Irish Farmers Journal last month bear out the complete lack of controls that exist in the production systems in Brazil. The EU authorities cannot have any faith in the control systems in Brazil. Ignoring this is putting public and consumer health at risk,"" he said. The IFA President said all imports should be stopped and food imports removed from the trade deal. ""In the meantime, there is an obligation on the Fine Gael leader to re-affirm his party’s position as set out in the Programme for Government,"" he concluded. Mercosur deal is not just about beef - Doherty Fine Gael's Dublin MEP Regina Doherty said that the Mercosur deal is not just about beef. Speaking on RTÉ's Today with David McCullough, she said; ""beef is a tiny, tiny part of what is overall potentially a very, very good deal for Ireland. ""There will be 700 million new customers for our pharmaceutical industry, for our machinery industry, for our medical equipment, for dairy, for whiskey. ""There'll be real great opportunities for businesses across the country of Ireland, including our farmers"", she said on the same programme. She said that there are concerns ""that have been ventilated for many, many months and still haven't been satisfied. ""And so, the other thing that I would say is that you'd be forgiven for thinking that beef was only going to come from Brazil when we signed this deal. ""With 260 tonnes of Brazilian beef in the European Union last year and probably the same amount this year. ""What the Mercosur deal will do is, number one, limit the amount of tonnage of beef, so therefore hopefully protecting the market, particularly for those people like Irish farmers, French farmers, Polish farmers, that it's really, really important to because we put so much essence into the quality of our production and our beef. ""But second of all, because of the concerns that farmers have raised, the Commission has come up with new SBS standards and checks to make sure that we're going to strengthen the controls on the ground."" Ms Doherty said the withdrawal this morning of products that are on the shelf is because the SBS checks are working. She explained that the SBS checks do not check every single consignment that leaves a country. ""And that's true of every other country that we do trade with around the world. It's true of Northern Ireland, it's true of the UK, it's true of all of the other third countries that we have. ""And we are already doing business with the countries that we're proposing to do a free trade deal with, which is what so-called Mercosur. ""The new consignments, restrictions, the strengthening of the SBS standards, the safeguards that we're discussing at our committees this week are an attempt by the Commission to reassure farmers who have raised concerns, and rightly so, because it's their income and it's their protection of their livelihoods and the standards that we cherish in Ireland. ""Those new safeguards will provide those extra measures of protection. And if it doesn't work, then there will be penalties. ""And that's not to say we expect it not to work, but as you can see this morning, not everything is infallible but what really is reassuring is that those consignments were identified near immediately and there have been recalled and be taken off our shelves and so we know that those SBS checks are working."" System 'just doesn't work', says Independent Ireland MEP Independent Ireland MEP for Midlands Northwest Ciaran Mullooly said farmers' concerns are down to health and safety and traceability about any beef that may come into this country under the deal, ""particularly from Brazil"". Also speaking on Today with David McCullough, he said that in the past ""we were told left, right, and center of the dangers"" of hormone growth promoters in cattle ""and we dealt with it."" However, he said, those illegal growth promoters are still on sale in Brazil, ""And worse again, the Farmers Journal proved that last week with their survey, worse again, they've got through this great system the European Commission told us about in recent weeks. ""They got through it. They got through the abattoir test in Brazil. They got into Europe. ""And what have we got in the last couple of days? A recall of meat products right across Europe, proving that the system just doesn't work"". He said that the system is supposed to work at abattoir level in Brazil. ""That's what we told by the commission for the last two years. The rigorous tests were talked about, the rigorous concerns at that stage, they didn't work. Mr Mullooly said that ""there's a cultural problem here. They went across 3,000km. ""They went to 14 different shops. They weren't even asked for an identification themselves, a cattle, a card number, a herd number for an animal. ""There's no culture in Brazil of logging the use of antibiotics in animal feed or in animal prescriptions. ""And you know what happens as a result? It goes into the food chain"". He said ""it is undeniable that that has serious implications for all of us down the line, because the overuse of antibiotics is bad news for public health."" He added; ""if we have it in the food chain coming through, it will be disastrous. ""And the problem is for Irish farmers, we can watch the health concerns, and if the politicians say we're not interested, we'll also watch our industry fall apart because our beef trade will suffer. ""The Brazilian farmers just simply don't have the same cost base"". The European Commission is pushing for the ratification of Mercosur, which would create the world's biggest free-trade zone and significantly increase EU exports to Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Mercosur countries would be able to export up to 99,000 tonnes of beef into the EU at a much-reduced tariff rate of 7.5%, as well as 180,000 tonnes of poultry. Several EU member states, notably Ireland and France, are opposed to its ratification, citing the potential to massively distort key agricultural markets. Additional reporting: Aengus Cox",centre
"Global growth is holding up better than expected as an artificial intelligence investment boom helps offset some of the shock from US tariff hikes, the OECD said today, nudging up its outlook for some major economies. The Paris-based organisation warned, however, that global growth was vulnerable to any new outbreak of trade tensions while investor optimism about AI could trigger a stock market correction if expectations are not met. In its Economic Outlook, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast global growth would slow modestly from 3.2% in 2025 to 2.9% in 2026, leaving its forecasts untouched from its last estimates in September. It predicted a rebound to 3.1% in 2027. OECD head Mathias Cormann said the trade shocks triggered by US President Donald Trump's tariff hikes had so far proved relatively mild, but added their costs were likely to rise. ""The full effects of those higher tariffs since the start of the year will become clearer as firms run down the inventoriesthat they built up,"" he told a press conference. Upgraded growth forecasts for 2025, but risks remain The US economy is forecast to grow 2% in 2025, revised up from 1.8% in September, before slowing to 1.7% in 2026 - up from 1.5% predicted in September. AI investment, fiscal support and expected Federal Reserve rate cuts are helping offset the drag from tariffs on imported goods, reduced immigration and federal job cuts, the OECD said. However, it warned that the Trump administration had put US fiscal policy on an unsustainable trajectory with large budget deficits and rising debt that would require a ""significant adjustment"" in the coming years. China's growth is expected to hold steady at 5% in 2025, up from 4.9% in September, before slowing to 4.4% in 2026 - unchanged from September - as fiscal support fades and new US tariffs on goods imported from China bite. The euro zone's 2025 growth forecast was revised up to 1.3% from 1.2%, supported by resilient labour markets and increased public spending in Germany. Growth is expected to moderate to1.2% in 2026 - it was seen at 1% previously - as budget tightening in France and Italy weighs on the outlook. Japan's economy is projected to grow 1.3% in 2025, up from 1.1%, and buoyed by strong corporate earnings and investment, before slowing to 0.9% in 2026. Trade and inflation outlook Global trade growth is expected to moderate from 4.2% in 2025 to 2.3% in 2026 as the full effects of tariffs weigh on investment and consumption. Elevated trade policy uncertainty limits prospects for a recovery. Inflation is projected to gradually return to central bank targets by mid-2027 in most major economies. In the US, inflation is expected to peak in mid-2026 due to tariff pass-through before easing. In China and some emerging markets, inflation is projected to rise modestly as excess production capacity declines. Most major central banks are expected to maintain or lower borrowing costs over the coming year as inflation pressuresease. The Federal Reserve is projected to cut rates slightly by the end of 2026, barring inflation surprises from tariffs.",centre
"5 ways Republicans are breaking with Trump President Trump is facing increasing resistance from Republicans in Congress to certain proposals and parts of his agenda as he nears the end of his first year back in office. Trump remains the unquestioned leader of the Republican Party, and aides have argued that any lawmakers who fall out of line risk facing a primary or losing the president’s support. But that hasn’t stopped GOP lawmakers from criticizing Trump’s actions or rebuffing some of his demands. A handful of Republicans bucked public pressure from the White House earlier this month to sign a discharge petition to force the release of files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. That break with the White House is perhaps a sign of things to come. Here are five other areas where Republicans are breaking with Trump. Foreign policy Trump has spent much of his first year back in office focused on brokering deals abroad to resolve conflicts, but his approach has frustrated different factions of the Republican Party. The White House has touted progress on a peace agreement that could end the fighting in Ukraine nearly four years after Russian forces launched an invasion. But the initial proposal was panned by lawmakers like Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who raised concerns that it was too deferential to Russia and would not yield a lasting peace in Ukraine. “If Administration officials are more concerned with appeasing Putin than securing real peace, then the President ought to find new advisors,” McConnell, who is retiring after next year, said in a fiery statement. Trump’s backers have also been divided over his continued military support for Israel amid its war against Hamas in the Middle East. One of the most outspoken Republicans to take issue with Trump’s handling of Israel has been Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.). The congresswoman, once one of Trump’s most outspoken supporters, has spent weeks criticizing Republican leadership and argued Trump was not focused enough on domestic issues. She announced amid a widening rift with Trump that she would resign from Congress in January. Trump is also facing Republican criticism as he takes an increasingly aggressive posture toward Venezuela. The Pentagon has repositioned assets near Venezuela, raising concerns that the White House is preparing for conflict with the Maduro regime. “If he invades Venezuela or gives more money to Ukraine, his movement will dissolve,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said last week. On Saturday, the House Armed Services Committee said it will probe the administration after The Washington Post reported Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered to leave no survivors in the first strike in Venezuela. “We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” Reps. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said in a statement. Tariff dividend checks The president has in recent weeks floated an idea to use money from tariff revenue to send out $2,000 checks to millions of Americans. Trump has been facing pressure to take action to lower costs for Americans as polling shows public frustration with the high cost of living. One solution from the White House would be to turn money brought in by tariffs into money in Americans’ pockets. One major problem? It would require congressional action, and many Republicans are not on board. “Look, we can’t afford it. I wish we were in a position to return the American public their money, but we’re not,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo last week. Other Republicans have for weeks offered a message similar to the Wisconsin senator’s. Deficit hawks in Congress have argued that any money brought in from tariff revenue should be used to reduce the national debt, which is more than $38 trillion. “The amount of revenue coming in from the tariffs is considered to be substantial at this point and hopefully can be put to a useful purpose, in my view one of which would be repaying the debt,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said earlier this month. Trump’s idea for a tariff dividend has been a recurring one throughout his second term so far. He initially raised the prospect of a “DOGE Dividend,” using money from contracts eliminated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to send cash to Americans. But that idea failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill, as Republicans again argued any savings should be used to lower the debt. Artificial intelligence policy Trump has repeatedly talked about the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and the need for the U.S. to own the issue, and his administration has taken steps to expand the use of AI. Trump last week signed an executive order establishing the “Genesis Mission,” a new effort to create an integrated AI platform that brings together federal datasets, computing resources and AI tools to boost scientific research. The administration earlier this month crafted a draft executive order that would create a task force to challenge state AI laws and block broadband funding for states that implement regulations around the technology. But the president’s push to expand the use of AI has prompted blowback from some conservatives who are wary of the technology. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has been an outspoken critic of technology companies, and he has raised additional concerns about the growing use of AI. Hawley previously called for the repeal of a law that offers legal protections to major tech companies, specifically citing their training of AI models on copyrighted works. Steve Bannon, a former top Trump adviser and influential voice in the MAGA movement, called AI “the most dangerous technology in the history of mankind” on his radio show. “Technology has tremendous upside if properly guided,” Bannon said last week. “But unguided, incredibly dangerous.” Redistricting The White House has pushed Republicans in red states to redraw their congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterms with the goal of adding a few more safe GOP seats to help the party retain the majority. Texas and Missouri delivered on the administration’s wishes, but that hasn’t been the case everywhere. Indiana Republicans in particular have expressed reservations about redistricting, drawing Trump’s ire. Leaders in the Indiana House and Senate announced each chamber would make a final decision in early December on whether to pursue redistricting. Trump welcomed the latest development, and he cautioned Indiana lawmakers against opposing his wishes. “I am glad to hear the Indiana House is stepping up to do the right thing, and I hope the Senate finds the Votes,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “If they do, I will make sure that all of those people supporting me win their Primaries, and go on to Greatness but, if they don’t, I will partner with the incredibly powerful MAGA Grassroots Republicans to elect STRONG Republicans who are ready to do what is needed to protect our Country and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump has also faced some pushback from Republicans at the national level on redistricting, specifically those at risk of losing their seats because of the partisan battle to redraw maps. Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) has been an outspoken critic of the redistricting wars and has introduced legislation that would ban all mid-decade redistricting efforts nationwide. End the filibuster and blue slips Trump has for months expressed frustration with the rules governing the Senate, and he has turned up the pressure on Republican senators to do away with regulations like the filibuster and blue slip policy. As the record-setting government shutdown dragged on, Trump turned to social media to repeatedly urge senators to eliminate the filibuster, which requires legislation to garner 60 votes to pass the chamber. He even made the case to senators in person at a White House breakfast earlier this month. But Trump’s pleas have done little to sway Republicans who view the filibuster as an important tool to protect the rights of the minority party, and who see abandoning the procedure as a risky move. Thune has said his position on keeping the filibuster has not changed. Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) has said he is a “firm no” on eliminating the filibuster. “The filibuster has traditionally been viewed as a very important safeguard. If the shoe was on the other foot, I don’t think our team would like it,” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said earlier this month. Trump has also taken issue with the Senate’s “blue slip” tradition, under which home-state senators can veto District Court judge and U.S. attorney nominees. The president has urged senators to ditch the policy, arguing Democrats have used it to slow down the confirmation of nominees in certain posts. But a change to that policy lacks support as well, with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) pushing back from his perch as head of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Grassley has argued that a nominee who does not have a blue slip returned does not have the votes to get confirmed. “As chairman I set Pres Trump noms up for SUCCESS NOT FAILURE,” Grassley posted on the social platform X in August.

"Japan's economy shrank almost 2% in the three months to September, as a drop in exports in the face of US tariffs resulted in the first contraction in six quarters, government data showed today. Shipments from carmakers in particular plummeted, following a period of hiking exports before tariffs came into effect. Still, as the overall contraction was not as acute as expected, it likely represents a temporary setback rather than the start of a recession, economists said. ""The contraction is largely due to one-time factors such as housing investment"" affected by regulatory change, said economist Kazutaka Maeda at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute. ""Exports also reacted,"" he said. ""Overall, the economy lacks strong underlying momentum, but the trend still points to a gradual recovery over the next year or two."" Economists generally viewed this quarter's GDP figures as having a marginal impact on Bank of Japan thinking when next deciding interest rates versus factors such as inflation. However, an economist close to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi gave the data more weight. Given the contraction, it ""would be misguided for the Bank of Japan to decide to raise interest rates"" in December, Credit Agricole chief Japan economist Takuji Aida, who is on Takaichi's flagship panel tasked with laying out the country's growth strategy, said in a report to clients. Japan's gross domestic product contracted 1.8% in the three months from July to September. That compared with revised growth of 2.3% in the previous three-month period, as well as the 2.5% contraction that economists on average estimated in a Reuters poll. The reading also translated into a quarterly contraction of 0.4% compared to the median estimate of 0.6%. Exports constituted the main drag as the impact of higher US tariffs intensified. Automakers saw shipment volume plunge, reversing earlier front-loaded exports ahead of tariff hikes, though they mostly absorbed tariffs by cutting prices. Net external demand, or exports minus imports, knocked 0.2 of a percentage point off growth, versus a 0.2 point positive contribution in April-June. The US and Japan formalised an agreement in September that implemented a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, compared to an initial 27.5% on cars and 25% for most other goods. Japanese housing investment also weighed on growth as tighter energy-efficiency regulation introduced in April slowed commitments. Private consumption, which accounts for over half of economic output, grew 0.1%, matching a market estimate. That was cooler than the 0.4% of the second quarter, indicating that high food costs increased reluctance to spend. Capital spending, another key driver of private demand-led growth, rose 1.0% in the third quarter, far exceeding a market estimate of 0.3%. ""Private consumption rose for the sixth straight quarter, and capital expenditure increased for the fourth consecutive quarter,"" Minoru Kiuchi, the economic revitalisation minister, said in a statement. ""This reinforces our view that the economy remains on a moderate recovery path,"" he said. Private-sector estimates reflect expectation for growth to rebound in October-December. A poll of 37 economists by the Japan Center for Economic Research projected a 0.6% expansion. The weak GDP data comes as Takaichi's government compiles a stimulus package to help households manage rising living costs. Advisers to Takaichi have cited a likely sharp GDP contraction as a reason for aggressive stimulus measures. Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama told reporters over the weekend that proposed economic stimulus would exceed 17 trillion yen ($109.94 billion), media reported.",centre
"AIB has upgraded its forecast for growth in the domestic Irish economy, as the bank said the uncertainty created by the imposition of US tariffs has ""begun to dissipate."" In its latest Economic Outlook Report, AIB said Ireland's economy has proven ""robust"" to global uncertainty and an escalation in trade tariffs. The bank said it has led to a ""stronger than previously expected outlook for the domestic economy."" ""However, geopolitical uncertainty remains high and because of that consumer spending and business investment growth in Ireland are still expected to cool,"" it added. Since its last outlook report, the bank has revised upwards its forecast for modified domestic demand (MDD), which is a better measure of domestic activity in the economy. It now expects MDD, which increased by 2.7% last year, to grow by 3.2% in 2025, 2.5% next year and 2.7% in 2027, amid an ""improved international outlook."" In May, AIB forecast MDD growth slowing to 2.3% this year and to 2% in 2026, before bouncing back to 2.6% in 2027. In terms of employment levels, the bank said the labour market will continue to grow, but it said given the expected easing in economic growth next year, it expects ""a more modest expansion in employment."" Following a 2.7% rise in 2024, AIB has forecasted employment growth slowing to 2.1% in 2025, 1.7% in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027. The bank said further shifts in US trade and economic policy are among the main downside risks to the Irish economy. It said while some indigenous Irish export sectors may now be exposed to higher US tariffs, there have also been some key carve outs below the headline 15% rate for generic pharmaceuticals and aircraft parts in the EU-US trade deal. ""This should mean Ireland’s effective tariff settles below that headline 15% rate,"" according to AIB. ""In terms of upside risks, a further easing in global uncertainty could underpin stronger domestic spending and investment in the coming years,"" it added. Commenting on the report, AIB’s chief economist said the global macro backdrop has ""improved since our last Economic Outlook in May 2025."" David McNamara said the uncertainty created by the dramatic shift in US trade policy in April is still elevated, but he said the EU-US trade deal has also ""brought some predictability for exporters."" ""Amid this volatility, the Irish economy has been robust, but there are some signs of cooling, particularly in the labour market,"" he said. ""For the domestic economy we expect an easing in growth next year, as ongoing uncertainty dampens both consumer spending and business investment growth,"" he added. Mr McNamara said while the risks remain tilted to the downside, ""the Irish economy has shown remarkable resilience to global shocks in recent years, and the economy is set to continue to outperform European peers."" In terms of gross domestic product (GDP), which includes the activity of multinational companies, AIB has also revised upwards its growth forecast. The bank now expects GDP to grow by 9.1% this year, slowing to 3.8% next year, with growth of 3.5% in 2027. AIB said Irish GDP remains ""a volatile gauge of activity, as evidenced by the sharp swings in growth in recent quarters, but the globalised nature of Ireland’s GDP also reveals the impact of tariff front-running in the global economy."" ""In the first half of 2025, GDP grew by an enormous 18% year-on-year, driven almost entirely by activity and exports from Ireland’s multinational sector. ""While this surge in exports is now starting to ebb, there are also signs of structural factors driving the recent growth in Irish manufacturing,"" it added. The bank notes that Ireland has become ""a production hub for the weight-loss drug market, from which a specific hormone derivative product accounted for 56%, by value, of all Irish pharma exports to the US in H1 2025, compared to just 8% in H1 2024."" AIB said the surge in global demand for weight-loss drugs is ""likely to underpin Irish pharma exports in the near term."" It said it highlights ""the increasing importance of a small number of firms for Irish GDP, and the growing reliance of the Exchequer on associated tax receipts.""",centre
"Ireland's gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to grow exceptionally by 10.7% in 2025, mainly due to strong export activity in the first half of the year, the European Commission said in its Autumn 2025 Economic Forecast today. As the frontloading of exports effect unwinds, growth is expected to moderate to 0.2% in 2026, reflecting a technical base effect from 2025 dynamics, before stabilising at 2.9% in 2027, the EU said. Inflation is projected to remain contained, while the labour market is expected to continue expanding, it added. Today's report also said the outlook for public finances is positive but marked by significant risks to corporation tax revenues. Meanwhile, the euro zone economy will grow faster than earlier expected in 2025, the European Commission also forecast today, mainly thanks to a surge in exports in the first half of the year ahead of expected tariff increases. The EU executive arm said gross domestic product in the 20 countries that share the euro currency would grow 1.3% this year, rather than 0.9% as forecast last April, and up from 0.9% growth in 2024. But growth is to slow marginally to 1.2% in 2026, a downward revision of the Commission's own 1.4% forecast from April, before accelerating again to 1.4% growth in 2027. ""Initially fuelled by a surge in exports in anticipation of tariff increases, the steady - albeit modest -growth observed so far highlights the resilience of the EU economy in the face of a challenging external environment,"" the Commission said. ""Inflation is nearing the ECB target, and financing conditions have improved,"" the forecast said. Consumer price growth in the euro zone is to slow to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026 from 2.4% last year, the Commission said. But despite the faster growth, public finances are to deteriorate, with the euro zone aggregated budget deficit rising to 3.2% of GDP this year from 3.1% last year and expanding further to 3.3% in 2026 and 3.4% in 2027. Aggregated euro zone public debt is also to increase, the Commission said, going up to 88.8% of GDP this year from 88.1% in 2024 and then to 89.8% in 2026 and 90.4% in 2027. The budget deficit of the euro zone's biggest economy Germany is to jump to 4% of GDP next year from 3.1% this year and 2.7% in 2024, mainly as a result of higher defence spending. The second biggest euro zone economy France is expected to cut it budget gap to 5.5% of GDP this year from 5.8% in 2024 despite its government crisis, the Commission forecast. The French budget gap is to fall to 4.9% in 2026, it forecast.",centre
"Manufacturing was weak in the US, Europe and Asia's biggest economies in November, business surveys showed today, as subdued domestic demand and tariff uncertainties weighed. The United States, euro zone, China and Japan all saw manufacturing activity contract last month although there were bright spots for Britain and economies in Southeast Asia, which saw growth, purchasing managers' surveys showed. Factory activity contracted for the ninth straight month in the US amid slumping orders and higher prices for inputs. Euro zone manufacturing activity slipped back into contraction territory last month, its purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed, and Germany's dominant manufacturing sector experienced a marked deterioration in business conditions. While weakening demand in the euro zone forced firms to cut jobs at the quickest rate in seven months, in Germany- Europe's largest economy - new orders fell at the fastest rate in 10 months. ""Current conditions remain at best subdued, with output trending down from an already weak level, reflecting the combination of headwinds faced by the manufacturing sector, including tariffs, heightened Chinese competition and general economic uncertainty,"" said Leo Barincou, senior economist at Oxford Economics. ""The persistent industrial slump appears to be putting pressure on headcount, with firms shedding jobs at the fastest pace since April. Meanwhile, weak demand means that firms were unable to transmit the rise in input costs to their selling prices."" In China, the world's largest manufacturer, factory activity slipped back into a slight contraction, a private-sector PMI showed, a day after Beijing's official measure indicated activity falling for the eighth consecutive month, albeit at a slower pace. ""Container throughput at Chinese ports was little changed last month compared to October. To the extent that demand did improve, it didn't do much to support production amid already high inventory levels - the output component dropped to a four-month low,"" said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. ""And while the output price component edged up slightly, it stayed at a low level, pointing to persistent deflationary pressures."" MANUFACTURING PICKS UP IN BRITAIN Among major European economies, France's manufacturing sector contracted further in November as a drop in production and slower demand for goods hit the sector. S&P Global's survey said demand for French goods had continued to weaken in November, extending the current sequence of declining factory orders to three-and-a-half years. Italy's manufacturing sector crept back into growth territory in November, a positive sign for its struggling economy. In Britain, outside the European Union, the manufacturing sector recorded its first increase in activity since September 2024 last month, bolstered by improved domestic demand and less of a slowdown in orders from overseas. Meanwhile, Asia's other manufacturing powerhouses also struggled with sluggish demand in November, extending declines in factory activity, as progress in U.S. trade negotiations failed to translate into a significant recovery in orders. Japan's PMI showed new orders continued to decline, stretching the downturn to two-and-a-half years. Across Asia this year, businesses in major exporting nations have been scrambling to navigate the uncertainty created by US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. While Trump's trade deals with countries like Japan and South Korea and lowered tensions with China have given firms some confidence, many are still adjusting to the new US trade reality. South Korea's factory activity contracted for a second month in November. However, separate data showed Korean exports rose in November for a sixth consecutive month, beating market expectations, as chip sales hit a record on strong technology demand while autos also jumped after a US trade deal. Taiwan's PMI showed factory activity continued to fall, but at a slower pace. Elsewhere in Asia, emerging-market manufacturers remained outperformers with Indonesia and Vietnam both reporting brisk growth in factory activity and Malaysia swinging back to growth.",centre
"Toyota has today raised its full-year profit forecast, as the Japanese automaker bet solid performance outside the US would help it ride out the impact of US President Donald Trump's import tariffs. The world's top-selling carmaker now expects operating profit of 3.4 trillion yen ($22.6 billion) for the financial year to end-March, up 6% from the 3.2 trillion yen it previously forecast. US tariffs have dealt a body blow to an industry already smarting from fierce competition from China's EV makers and a once-in-a-century upheaval brought by the advance of new driving technology. Toyota estimated the tariffs would cost it 1.45 trillion yen in the current financial year. ""North America is facing a very tough situation due to the impact of tariffs,"" Chief Financial Officer Kenta Kon told a results briefing. While conditions ""were not easy"" in other markets such as China, Europe, Asia and Africa, both profitability and sales volume remained ""solid"", he said. For the quarter, operating profit tumbled 27% to 839.6 billion yen, falling short of the 863.1 billion yen average in a survey of eight analysts by LSEG. That marked its second decline in quarterly profits in a row. In a sign of the strain from tariffs, Toyota's North American business swung to a loss of 134 billion yen for the first half of the year, even as demand for its vehicles in the region remained strong, leading to tight inventories. Kon's deputy Takanori Azuma told the briefing that markets such as India were increasingly becoming important to profits and helping offset the battering in the US. A decade ago, Toyota's profit structure was heavily dependent on North America, with nearly half of profits coming from there, Azuma said. ""If tariffs had become an issue under those circumstances, the impact would have been much greater,"" he said. Toyota said last week its worldwide production increased by more than 10% in September and rose for a fourth month in a row, as both sales and output increased in the US, its top market. Toyota shares stayed deep in negative territory on Wednesday, closing down 3.65% compared to a loss of 2.5% in the Nikkei index.",centre
"The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) has said an investigation carried out by the Irish Farmers Journal (IFJ) in Brazil undermines arguments by the European Commission that the EU-Mercosur trade deal should be approved. The IFJ investigation claims to have been able to buy animal antibiotics in Brazil without prescriptions, and hormones which are banned in the EU. The commission is pushing for the ratification of the agreement, which would create the world's biggest free-trade zone and significantly increase EU exports to Mercosur countries - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Mercosur countries would be able to export up to 99,000 tonnes of beef into the EU at a much-reduced tariff rate of 7.5%, as well as 180,000 tonnes of poultry. A number of EU member states, notably Ireland and France, are opposed to its ratification, citing the potential to massively distort key agricultural markets. In its report, the IFJ claims its Beef Editor Adam Woods - who recently travelled to Brazil - was able to complete wholesale purchases of animal antibiotics without prescriptions, and that hormones given to animals that are banned in the EU were freely available to buy. The publication said it recorded undercover video footage to document the purchases. The IFA confirmed its Senior Policy Officer Tomás Bourke accompanied Mr Woods and the photo editor of the IFJ on the trip. According to the farming organisation, ""the team were able to walk into over a dozen agri-stores in Brazil and buy any amount of antibiotics without showing any prescription, ID or herd number and were not asked any questions whatsoever about why they needed the products"". IFA President Francie Gorman said that ""having viewed the findings ... the EU Commission cannot stand over what is going on in Brazil from the viewpoint of the use of animal medicines and the lack of traceability"". Mr Gorman said: ""This flies in the face of all EU protocols in the fight against anti-microbial resistance (AMR) in humans."" Mr Gorman also called for the Mercosur deal ""to be stopped"". He added: ""It completely undermines arguments by the EU Commission that the Mercosur trade deal should be approved because there will be an equivalence of standards between the Mercosur countries and the EU."" In September, the European Commission said the same food safety and animal health standards that apply to EU farmers will also apply to South American producers, who will be subject to the same licensing requirements and audits. At the time, the commission also said it would be stepping up import controls by increasing the number of audits and checks in third countries.",centre
"Irish whiskey distillers have renewed their call on the Government and the EU to step up efforts to secure a zero-for-zero trading deal with the US for their products. The call was made as the industry launched a new tourism initiative aimed at attracting more visitors to distilleries around the country. The Irish Whiskey Way is designed to showcase 26 distilleries across the island in the five designated tourist regions, including the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, Ireland’s Ancient East, Dublin and Northern Ireland. It is aimed at promoting Ireland’s food and drinks trails to international and domestic visitors. The Irish Whiskey Way was launched by Minister for Enterprise and Tourism Peter Burke at the Kilbeggan Distillery Experience in Co Westmeath. Mr Burke described it as ""a unique initiative that celebrates one of Ireland’s most iconic exports while showcasing the rich culture, heritage and hospitality that makes our country and this region so special"". ""This journey will not only highlight the craftsmanship behind Irish whiskey but also connect visitors with the vibrant communities, food experiences and stories that define Ireland,"" he said. In the year to June, just over one million people toured Irish whiskey distilleries, a 23% increase in the number of visitors compared to the previous year. It is hoped the new whiskey trail will help to build on those numbers. Chief Executive of Tourism Ireland Alice Mansergh said it will provide a boost to the tourism sector. Ms Mansergh said it will enable visitors to ""experience the 700-year history of whiskey on this island"". ""It's really significant that the distilleries themselves have reported a million visitors over the past year, so we can see that at the moment, tourism is good for whiskey, and whiskey is good for tourism too,"" she said. Director of the Irish Whiskey Association Eoin Ó Catháin said the new initiative was developed by whiskey distilleries ""working together to present a unique food and drink trail to the international and domestic visitor"". Mr Ó Catháin said the importance of cooperation ""has never been greater, this year more than ever, and the value of every euro spent in Ireland has never been more appreciated"". The initiative has been launched against the backdrop of the 15% tariffs on goods being exported from the EU to the US, which is the biggest export market for Irish whiskey. Amid the initial uncertainty over the trade levy, up to 90% of whiskey production here was paused. While for the most part it has resumed, distillers say the levy is putting significant pressure on the sector, as businesses absorb the costs. Mr Ó Catháin said about 45% to 50% of Irish whiskey is exported to the US, ""so that 15% tariff is a tax on that that ultimately the producers must pay"". He said the sector is hopeful because he said there ""seems to be some momentum building this week, discussions are ongoing about maybe a tariff exemption for products like ours."" ""We know that we have strong advocates, both in government in Dublin, and in Brussels, in the European Commission. ""We need to make sure that we're still in the conversation, and that exemptions, when they do come on the table, include the whiskey sector,"" he added. Mr Ó Catháin said the fact that the tariff is there is ""still causing some uncertainty"". ""It is harder to attract investment. I think what we're seeing is that further investment or further expansion in the US market is now being impacted,"" he added. However, Mr Ó Catháin said there are new markets being opened up, as companies diversify. ""We're having great success throughout the EU and throughout emerging markets in Asia and Africa,"" he said. In Brussels on Monday, Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee raised the easing of the trade tariffs on a number of Irish products, including whiskey, at the EU trade council, ahead of talks with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer. Peter Burke said there is ""no doubt it's a very significant challenge for the sector"". ""What we are trying to do is to get those key carve outs. Obviously, drinks is key in terms of tariffs and the viability of it and I know they have a very strong ask for zero-for-zero and it’s one which the government is really trying to work on,"" Mr Burke said. ""We're trying to work on those key sectors, like drinks, like pharma, all those that are so important for the strategic success of our economy,"" he added.

"Gap has beaten Wall Street expectations for third-quarter comparable sales and profit, helped by strong marketing-driven demand for its Old Navy and Banana Republic brand apparel. Shares of the company rose about 5% in extended trading on Wall Street last night. The clothing maker has banked on efforts such as introducing limited-edition products in collaboration with Disney, Netflix's ""Stranger Things"", and Universal's ""Wicked"" to drive sales. Initiatives such as ""Better in Denim"" featuring global girl group Katseye, and campaigns such as ""Feels Like Gap"" and ""Get Loose with Troye Sivan"", helped Gap boost its brand relevance among Gen Z shoppers. Gap last month announced the launch of an affordable beauty and personal care line for this fall in a bid to diversify beyond apparel. The company reiterated its forecast for a US tariff impact on its annual operating margin between 100 and 110 basis points. Gap sources less than 10% of its merchandise from China as of 2024. CEO Richard Dickson had said in May the company expects reliance on China to be less than 3% by the end of 2025. For the third quarter, comparable sales rose 5%, beating expectations of 3.26% growth, according to data compiled by LSEG. Comparable sales for Old Navy and namesake Gap brand rose 6% and 7% respectively, while Banana Republic grew 4%. Meanwhile, comparable sales for Athleta, Gap's athleisure brand, fell 11%, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of decline. It has been narrowing its assortment to focus on items in demand such as women's activewear to turn around the business. ""Athleta continues to be the biggest drag on the company,"" eMarketer analyst Sky Canaves said, adding that there are no indications of concrete progress on the horizon despite plans for a brand reset. Gap's quarterly revenue rose 3% to $3.94 billion, narrowly surpassing expectations of $3.91 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of 62 cents beat expectations of 59 cents.",centre

"The Irish Road Hauliers Association has criticised Dublin Port's plan to significantly raise its charges on goods shipments from next year. The port plans to raise the charge levied on unaccompanied shipping containers by 5%, raising the base price of a 40ft container to €38.33. There will also be a new €15 infrastructure charge - which amounts to an effective 46% increase in the charges levied on a container compared to 2025. ""We feel that these costs are a tariff on companies doing business in Ireland,"" said Ger Hyland, President of the Irish Road Hauliers Association. ""It's going to effect every company that's getting freight in and out of Ireland."" We need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences Dublin Port has said the higher charges and new levy are required to support the next phase of its €2 billion Masterplan 2040. That aims to double capacity at the port over the next 15 years. Outlining the rationale for its new charging structure, the Dublin Port Company said the port is currently running at close to capacity, making such a large-scale investment necessary. As the port is self-funding, it said, it is required to raise charges to cover the cost. The port company also said that this significant increase in charges comes on the back of two decades of relatively small change. It said charges had been flat between 2004 and 2021, with more modest increases introduced in recent years. ""However this was also in the context of a smaller capital programme,"" its charges update said. ""For context, the average annual capital spend between 2015 and 2024 was c.€65m with the same figure for 2025-2030 envisaged to be c.€170m – an increase of c.160%."" Mr Hyland agreed that investment was needed to ensure the port's capacity could keep up with demand, however he said there should be a different approach taken in funding that. ""The traffic throughput through Dublin Port over those two decades has been enormous,"" he said. ""So they've got their price increases in the upturn in freight that has come in and out of this country. ""There is also synergies there where there can be money saved."" He also said that the higher cost of shipping would inevitably be passed on to consumers. ""It's going to be seen in every shopping basket and every shopping trolley in Ireland,"" Mr Hyland said. ""Every euro that hits the shopping trolley at the present time is an attack on the consumer. ""Our hauliers and our logistics people, the container companies, they can't take this charge so it effectively has to be passed on."" According to Dublin Port, the new charges will mean a €16.83 increase in the cost of an unaccompanied shipping container, with an accompanied container costing €15.70 more. The Central Statistics Office estimates that the average shipping container coming through the port contains €100,000 worth of goods.",centre
"Dutch medical technology company Philips has today reported third-quarter profit above market expectations, helped by measures to mitigate the impact of tariffs and the launch of artificial intelligence tools. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) came in at €531m, surpassing the €484m expected by analysts. Its sales grew 3%, matching analysts expectations at €4.3 billion, driven by a strong performance in North America. Philips, which makes most of its revenue in the US, flagged a lower-than expected impact from US tariffs. CEO Roy Jakobs said in a call with reporters that the performance reflected investments in its supply chain to mitigate tariff impacts in the US and China. ""At the same time, we keep advocating that actually every dollar, euro, RMB spent on tariffs is not spent on patients. And actually healthcare is under enough pressure that they don't need additional pressure from tariffs,"" he added. Jakobs brushed off concerns regarding Nexperia, saying Philips does not use their chips. The chipmaker sparked Netherlands-China tensions when the Dutch government seized control in September. Philips today also reiterated its full year sales and earnings guidance. Philips is racing to develop AI-powered medical tools in patient monitoring, scanner and imagery, and diagnosis assistance. From January to September of this year, Philips spent €1.23 billion on R&D. Jakobs said that all its recent products featured AI and the company develops its own medical-tailored models using patient and customer data.",centre
"Trump’s Tariff Windfall Should Go to Parents President Trump has floated the idea of sending $2,000 checks to most Americans, funded by tariff revenue. The idea is to show Americans very directly how much the country is benefiting from the billions being paid in import duties. But a lump sum payment of $2,000 is not the best use of tariff revenue. Injecting a massive stimulus regardless of need risks fanning the flames of inflation. It’s likely that the Federal Reserve would seek to offset any boost in spending enabled by the check with higher interest rates. resident Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office on Oct. 16, 2025, in Washington, DC. (Francis Chung/Politico/Bloomberg via Getty Images)A better use of tariff revenue would be to dramatically expand the Child Tax Credit—delivered as quarterly payments rather than a year-end refund. This would provide meaningful, sustained support to families raising the next generation while avoiding the inflationary risks of universal cash payments. The math is straightforward. Tariffs are bringing in roughly $240 billion annually. The current Child Tax Credit costs about $120 billion per year and provides $2,000 per child. Instead of scattering money indiscriminately, we could use approximately $160 billion of that tariff revenue to restructure the credit this way: - $3,000 for the first child, - $4,000 for the second child, - $6,000 for the third child, - and $8,000 for the fourth and each additional child. The additional amounts above the current $2,000 baseline would be non-refundable—available only to families with tax liability. The idea is to provide tax relief rather than create another welfare program. Poorer families without tax liabilities would still get the existing refundable credit. Turning Tariff Revenue into a Pro-Family Tax Cut Consider what this means in practice. A family with three children currently receives $6,000 annually through the CTC. Under this expansion, they’d receive $13,000, an additional $7,000. Delivered quarterly, that’s $3,250 every three months. For a family with four children, the total rises to $21,000, or $5,250 per quarter. These aren’t trivial amounts. They represent meaningful support for families facing the actual costs of raising children: childcare that runs $10,000-$15,000 per child annually in many areas, rising food and clothing costs, educational expenses, and the countless other outlays that come with each additional child. Compare this to the proposed $2,000 universal checks. A family with four children would get $2,000 once. Under this alternative, they’d get $21,000 spread over the year. Which would actually help them manage the ongoing expenses of raising their family? The quarterly delivery mechanism matters. Rather than a one-time payment that hits the economy all at once—potentially driving up prices—quarterly payments align with the rhythm of family expenses. Parents need support in June for summer activities and in September for back-to-school costs, not just in April when they file their taxes. Spreading payments over time also reduces inflationary pressure by avoiding a sudden spike in aggregate demand. There’s a deeper logic to this structure. By making the additional amounts non-refundable and removing phase-outs at high income levels, this proposal targets families who are both paying substantial federal income taxes and raising multiple children. These are precisely the families that get squeezed hardest under current policy. Current policy claims to value family formation but does almost nothing to support it where it matters most. The existing Child Tax Credit phases out starting at $400,000 for married couples—not exactly a fortune when you’re raising multiple children in an expensive area. This expansion would remove those phase-outs, providing meaningful support to families regardless of income level, as long as they’re paying taxes. The contrast with universal checks is stark. Universal payments encourage consumption, which might make sense when the economy is slumping due to inadequate demand. It doesn’t make sense when the economy is growing rapidly and inflation remains stubbornly high. Family tax relief rewards investment in the future. Every child represents not just 18 years of expenses, but a future worker, taxpayer, and contributor to economic growth. If the goal of tariff policy is to rebuild American productive capacity, using the revenue to support American family formation is entirely consistent with that objective. This is also a better policy design than universal checks from an economic perspective. One-time payments tend to fuel spending surges as recipients treat them as windfalls. Research on previous stimulus programs shows that consumers spend a larger share of one-time payments than they do of regular income. Quarterly family payments, by contrast, are more likely to be incorporated into household budgets and used for necessary expenses rather than discretionary splurges. The political advantages are significant too. It’s more defensible to fiscal conservatives because it’s structured as tax relief for families with tax liability, not an expansion of the welfare state. And it gives Republicans something concrete on family values beyond rhetoric about the importance of marriage and children. The current debate over what to do with tariff revenue reveals a broader confusion about policy goals. It’s admirable to want to show Americans more directly the benefits of tariffs. But just doing that is short-sighted. We should aim higher by supporting American families and encouraging marriage, having children, and raising the next generation. Trump has made American renewal a central theme of his presidency. But renewal requires more than just reshoring factories and renegotiating trade deals. It requires families willing and able to have children. That won’t happen if policy continues to squeeze families with substantial tax burdens while offering minimal support for the enormous expenses of raising multiple children. The $2,000 checks would make headlines for a week and then be forgotten. Quarterly payments that actually help families manage the costs of raising children would be policy that matters. If we’re going to use tariff revenue for tax relief, let’s use it in a way that advances actual policy goals rather than just generating a news cycle.

"As the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing the limits of the executive branch’s authority on tariffs, it is important to consider the tradeoffs that come with free trade. In American political and business circles, free trade has long been the favored mantra. Investors, executives, and most politicians speak of it with near-religious conviction. According to Google Trends, Americans have searched for “free trade” roughly twice as often as for “fair trade” since 2004. Mentions of fair or reciprocal trade, by contrast, are far rarer—though Donald Trump managed to raise their profile over the past decade. This imbalance in attention is not just a matter of economic theory. It reflects the political arithmetic that makes free trade a perennial favorite and fair trade a hard sell in Washington. This arithmetic follows an old Chinese proverb: “It is better to break one finger than to injure ten” (伤其十指，不如断其一指). But doing this can land the American economy in a ditch. Politicians rarely lose votes backing free trade, because the numbers—of voters, donors, and dollars—tilt decisively in its favor. On the one hand, tariffs are the inevitable instrument of fair trade. They help domestic producers compete, reopen shuttered plants, and revive manufacturing towns. They also allow middle-aged steelworkers, for example, to keep well-paying jobs rather than take minimum-wage ones. But tariffs come with visible costs on the other hand. Importers pay first, then try—often unsuccessfully—to pass them along to consumers. Exporters and original equipment manufacturers absorb another share to keep their business. Eventually, the burden ripples through currencies, supply chains, and countries. As such, tariffs are not exactly a tax on consumers in the conventional sense, even though consumers may and frequently do end up paying higher prices. As a result, politicians follow the Chinese proverb instinctively: higher tariffs hurt many consumers a little, but help a few workers a lot. Lower tariffs, meanwhile, help many consumers a little, but hurt a few workers a lot. Faced with a choice between slightly annoying millions or devastating thousands, politicians will choose the latter. They’d rather break one finger than to injure ten. And so, free trade wins. There’s more. Advocating free trade is not only politically safer—it’s more lucrative. Campaign donations tend to flow from the beneficiaries of global capital mobility, not from the victims of industrial decline. Free trade in America, of course, does not mean reciprocal trade. Foreign firms often enjoy wide access to U.S. markets, while American companies face high barriers abroad. This asymmetry gives foreign producers a structural advantage. They can exploit scale economies, invest more heavily in innovation, and recruit global talent—all while American firms face shrinking market share. Imagine a pharmaceutical company in New Jersey with a patented drug. If it produces in the U.S., it can sell domestically—but faces steep tariffs abroad. If it produces, say in China, however, it can sell both in China and in the U.S. tariff-free. The “giant sucking sound” Ross Perot once warned about is the sound of capital following profits—away from American workers and communities. As JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon recently lamented, “It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100% of our penicillin to come from China, and all of our rare earths, and all of our advanced chipmaking tools. We need to get our act together.” Yet the arithmetic of modern politics stands in the way. Capital is mobile; labor is not. Free trade enriches many investors by a small margin but impoverishes some workers by a large one. Fair or reciprocal trade, conversely, would slightly reduce returns for many investors to substantially improve conditions for a few workers. Given that political campaigns depend on money more than on gratitude, it’s easy to see which side wins. The irony is that by repeatedly “breaking one finger to save ten,” we may end up with none. Each individual decision to favor capital over labor, imports over production, or global supply chains over domestic resilience may seem compelling and rational in isolation. But cumulatively, they hollow out the national hand that once built and held the global economy. To “get our act together,” policymakers must change the arithmetic itself. Sometimes, it is wiser to “injure ten fingers a little” than to break one entirely. The business community can help by following the lead of companies like Apple—who has pledged to invested $600 billion in four years as part of its new American Manufacturing Program—and JP Morgan Chase—who is committing to facilitating and financing $1.5 trillion in the next decade to support U.S. economic security and resilience. Efforts like these allow the system to heal and keep all ten fingers intact. It’s time policymakers, business communities, and even consumers do the right thing and give fair trade a chance, even if it means we all must make some small sacrifices.

"Six months ago, CEOs of the world’s largest companies were preparing for turbulence. In an April survey by Fortune and Deloitte, 58% of global chief executives described their 12‑month economic outlook as pessimistic—half were simply cautious, while 8% were very pessimistic. Their gloom stemmed from fears over sweeping tariffs and tightening global financial conditions. Today, however, that sentiment has shifted dramatically. In the latest October survey, only 32% of CEOs now describe themselves as pessimistic about the global economy over the next year. Most say their concerns have eased, noting that tariffs have not disrupted global trade as feared. While few CEOs are celebrating just yet, the overall mood has improved. Their focus has shifted to managing a still-volatile but increasingly stable global landscape, where AI-driven innovation is taking center stage. The numbers to know 32% … of CEOs have a “pessimistic” (30%) or “very pessimistic” (2%) outlook for the global economy over the next 12 months. 26 … the percentage-point decline in pessimism since CEOs were last asked the same question in April 2025—at the height of the financial markets’ so-called “tariff tantrum.” 21% … of CEOs have a “pessimistic” (18%) or “very pessimistic” (3%) outlook for their industry performance over the next 12 months. 2% … of CEOs have a “pessimistic” (2%) or “very pessimistic” (0%) outlook for their company performance over the next 12 months. 37% … of CEOs say they think newly imposed tariffs will have a negative impact on their business. Another 51% say the impact will be neutral—meaning tariffs will bring a roughly equal mix of benefits and risks—while 10% say the tariffs will have a positive impact on their business. 80% … of CEOs say they are likely (38%) or very likely (42%) to implement cost-cutting measures over the next 12 months to offset higher costs related to current economic and trade policy uncertainties. 60% … of CEOs say AI will have a significant (45%) or transformational (15%) impact on their core processes over the next one to three years. The big picture After months of volatility and tariff worries, CEOs are starting to breathe easier. The Fortune and Deloitte survey finds leaders far less pessimistic about the global economy than they were in April. Many are now channeling energy toward cost discipline and AI-driven innovation rather than crisis management. It’s a shift from panic to pragmatism in the C-suite. A few deeper takeaways… CEOs are less bearish on the global economy than they were this spring Earlier this year, CEO sentiment took a sharp turn south amid what many dubbed the “tariff tantrum.” As trade tensions flared and questions mounted about how new import duties might ripple through global supply chains, 58% of CEOs told Fortune in April that they were pessimistic about the world economy’s outlook over the next 12 months. Six months later, that mood has eased. In the October survey, just 32% of CEOs described their outlook as pessimistic—a notable drop, though still above the lows seen in late 2024, when only 18% felt bearish. The shift suggests that while global growth remains uneven and risks persist, executives are adapting to the policy landscape and see less chance of a near-term downturn. The rebound in confidence comes as inflation pressures have remained in check and the Federal Reserve has resumed cutting short-term rates. Still, optimism is far from universal. Several respondents said ongoing geopolitical tensions, supply chain realignments, and policy uncertainty continue to cloud their long-term planning. In short, the panic of spring has given way to a more measured realism—CEOs aren’t panicked or exuberant, but they remain a bit cautious. CEOs see tariffs as a drag on the U.S. economy—but less so on their own companies Most CEOs think newly imposed tariffs will hurt the broader economy, even if their own firms can adapt. In Fortune’s October 2025 survey, 78% said tariffs will have a negative or somewhat negative impact on the U.S. economy. Yet when asked about their own company, more than half (51%) said the impact will be neutral, and only around one-third (38%) expect a negative or somewhat negative impact on their own company. That disconnect suggests CEOs may be either overestimating the drag on the macroeconomy—or underestimating how those same pressures could eventually reach their bottom line. In short, CEOs see tariffs as bad for business—just not necessarily for their business. CEOs plan to cut costs before passing them to customers With trade and economic uncertainty still lingering, most CEOs say their first move won’t be to raise prices—it’ll be to rein in expenses. According to Fortune’s October 2025 CEO survey, a combined 80% of respondents said they are likely or very likely to implement cost-cutting measures over the next 12 months to offset rising trade and policy-related costs. By comparison, about 64% said they plan to raise prices on goods or services, while only 43% expect to absorb those higher costs, even temporarily. The data suggest CEOs are preparing for a period of tighter margins and unpredictable input costs, but are still wary of testing customers’ tolerance for price hikes too quickly. CEOs say AI is already reshaping their core operations CEOs were most likely to cite core processes and resource allocation as areas seeing the deepest transformation. Around 60% of respondents said AI will have a significant or transformational effect on their core processes over the next one to three years. AI’s influence is also extending into long-term vision, growth strategy, and competitive positioning, where roughly half of CEOs reported at least a moderate level of impact. Methodology Fortune surveyed CEOs in collaboration with Deloitte between Oct. 3–16. A total of 69 responded to the survey, which was sent to the Fortune CEO Community. That includes chief executives from Fortune 500 and Global 500 companies as well as those attending Fortune conferences.",right
"Steel industry says Carney is moving in the right direction, but needs to pick up the pace Sector undergoing fundamental restructuring as market shifts away from United States and its tariffs Prime Minister Mark Carney is not moving as fast or as far on changing steel policies as industry players want, but they generally concede he is slowly taking major steps to transform the sector. His latest proposals will slash steel imports from free-trade-partner countries for the first time, further reduce steel imports from non-free-trade countries, cut imports of steel derivative products — essentially raw steel that has been minimally transformed — subsidize the cost of shipping steel across the country and step up border enforcement to ensure compliance. Taken together, the steps are what steel producers want, but haven’t come as quickly or reached as far as they’d like. “He is plodding along, as opposed to giving much faster relief,” Butch Mandel, chief executive and founder of Concord, Ont.-based Welded Tube of Canada Corp., said. “I suspect he’s going to get close, if not all the way, to what we’re asking, so why wait?” He said he found the pace of change highly “frustrating,” but he doesn’t fault Carney, given the challenges he faces, which include an unpredictable trade war that has left Canada’s steel sector highly exposed to downturn. The Canadian Steel Producers Association (CSPA) has been open about wanting a federal policy that slashes steel imports to 20 per cent of 2024 levels. “The ask of the industry was straightforward and it has not relented,” Mandel said. “We just said take everyone down to 20 per cent.” Carney on Wednesday tightened steel import quotas to restrict non-free-trade countries to importing no more than 20 per cent of the volumes they imported in 2024. Above that volume, they will encounter a 50 per cent tariff. For the first time, he also placed significant restrictions on steel imports from free-trade partners, which includes countries such as South Korea and Vietnam, reducing their shipments to 75 per cent of their import volume in 2024 before hitting a 50 per cent tariff. The policy excludes the U.S. and Mexico. The moves come after months of lobbying and still don’t reach the 20 per cent line on all countries, but it’s a policy that tightens controls on imports. “I’ve always looked at this stuff stepwise … and I consider this a very big step,” Catherine Cobden, chief executive of the CSPA, said. “We’ll take stock of things and come back to ask for adjustments if it’s not working.” For now, she said she was very happy to see policies that will open up new domestic demand. Carney also announced a global 25 per cent tariff on steel-derivative products from all countries, which won praise from Rita Rahmati, a spokesperson for the Canadian Institute of Steel Construction, a lobby group for steel fabricators and other companies that add value to raw steel. She said her organization had asked for such a policy months ago. Previously, by adding a screw or doing minor work to steel, foreign companies could avoid Canadian tariff quotas on steel. The new policy should plug “the loopholes,” she said. But it’s only a 25 per cent tariff and the industry might want a higher duty rate. “We’re at the point right now where we’re just pleased to have that,” Rahmati said. “We‘re not going to complain and say we’d like it to be higher.” Still, it’s clear the steel industry is undergoing a fundamental restructuring. Colin Mang, an economist at McMaster University in Hamilton, described it as a “reinvention” of the Canadian steel industry from a “north-to-south” focus to a new “east-to-west” focus. Historically, Canada has exported significant quantities of steel to the U.S. since there are major population centres with industrial demand just south of Quebec and Ontario, where Canada’s major mills are located. Now, producers must look to markets such as British Columbia to offset losses in the U.S., where tariffs are making their products less competitive. Cobden was in Victoria on Wednesday to meet with industry executives about how to accomplish this when Carney unveiled his latest steel policies, one of which aims to work with Canada’s two major railways to cut rail rates by half for domestically produced steel. “It’s definitely a huge benefit to the industry, all the stuff the government announced this week, and it’s good for the long-term vision of increasing internal trade,” he said. “We’ve talked about that for 130 years, and it’s really only in the past year that we’ve actually gotten around to taking the issue seriously.” There’s already a huge reshuffling of the steel industry underway, he said. Steel exports have fallen about 28 per cent while imports have fallen by 24 per cent. Chinese steel shipments to Canada have fallen to six per cent in 2025 from about 7.4 per cent of the total in 2024. The U.S. remains a major source of steel imports, but its role is declining. Through the first 11 months of 2025, Canada imported 1.4 million tonnes from the U.S., compared to 2.2 million in all of 2025, Mang said. Some other hard-hit industries, such as lumber, may be able to export their products to markets other than the U.S. But he said there aren’t any other likely export markets for steel other than the U.S. for a variety of reasons. “The Canadian steel industry will need to reorganize itself to focus primarily on serving the needs of the Canadian market,” he said. “The sooner they make that transition, the better.” Carney has been clear that he is taking a slow, safe approach. In private talks with industry members, he has said he doesn’t want to disrupt the economy by hastily slapping on tariffs that will be difficult to collect and could cause shortages of certain parts for businesses, according to a source who described one such discussion. “You don’t do it overnight because people have certain relationships, certain contracts,” Carney said when asked at a press conference on Wednesday why one of his policies won’t take effect until the end of January. “But you also don’t do it a year from now, or else it doesn’t have any benefit for the Canadian industry.” The policy in question are “remissions” that allow Canadians to import some steel products from the U.S. on a duty-free basis. Despite lobbying from steel producers to not allow remissions on U.S. steel at all, Carney issued yet another extension, but called it the final one. “I keep coming back to it; he’s saying things that no Canadian steel producer could argue with,” Mandel said. “The problem is he’s not going as far as I think he could go.” • Email: gfriedman@postmedia.com Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Shopify merchants not weighed down much by trade war, company says As retailers head into their busiest shopping season, they and their customers don’t appear to be feeling too bogged down by U.S. tariffs that have coloured much of the year. That’s according to executives at Shopify Inc., one of the world’s most prominent makers of e-commerce software. “When we look at the trade routes, when we look at the percentage of inbound versus outbound in the U.S., when we look at what we’re seeing on de minimis, we’ve not seen any significant impacts on our merchants,” chief financial officer Jeff Hoffmeister said on a Tuesday call with analysts. Economists have been closely watching the retail industry since Donald Trump kicked off his U.S. presidency by putting Canada and several other nations in his crosshairs at the start of the year. While he hasn’t made good on all of his threats, products like steel, aluminum, lumber and some auto parts crossing the Canada-U.S. border have all been slapped with higher duties. The de minimis exemption, a longtime U.S. trade rule that has allowed goods valued under US$800 to skip the duties, has also ended. Some feared the moves would result in a massive upheaval for businesses, but Hoffmeister said so far, Shopify’s merchants are “adapting quickly.” While many responded to April tariff announcements by raising prices, it’s been a less popular strategy lately. “The level of pricing increases is, in fact, slightly lower than the trends we were seeing last quarter,” Hoffmeister said. His remarks came as Shopify reported a blockbuster third quarter with a profit of US$264 million and 32 per cent jump in revenue, when the results are compared with a year ago. The company, which keeps its books in U.S. dollars, said its profit amounted to 20 cents US per diluted share for the period ended Sept. 30 compared with a profit of US$828 million or 64 cents US a year ago. On an adjusted basis, Shopify said it earned 34 cents US per share in its latest quarter compared with an adjusted profit of 36 cents US per share a year ago. Revenue for the quarter totalled US$2.84 billion, up from US$2.16 billion in the same quarter last year. Shopify president Harley Finkelstein, who joined Hoffmeister on the analyst call, saw the result as a sign that Shopify “can balance both growth and profitability.” “While we’re continuously evolving, the story of our results remains incredibly consistent,” he said. Some of Shopify’s growth can be attributed to artificial intelligence. It’s been increasingly embedding the technology in its software to ease some of the burdens merchants face and is pushing staff to use it to make them more effective. With AI now becoming so “reflexive” and its automation driving so many productivity gains, Hoffmeister said the company has been able to “redeploy talent to the highest-impact work.” Thus, Shopify’s head count has consistently been flat to down, both sequentially and year-over-year, and its operating expenses have dropped from 45 per cent in 2023 to 37 per cent this year. Another driver of Shopify’s growth has been its ability to cater to so many industries. While Hoffmeister listed apparel, accessories, health, food and beverage, beauty, home, and garden as strong performers in Shopify’s third quarter, it is also seeing rapid growth in other areas, where it’s won business away from larger enterprise platforms. For example, Shopify’s pet supplies vertical grew by more than 50 per cent, and arts and entertainment were up 45 per cent. “All roads lead to Shopify,” Finkelstein said. “Whether it’s food or manufacturing or education or even automotive, these are verticals traditionally, we didn’t go after and now, we’re winning them.” The success has showed up in numbers like Shopify’s merchant solutions revenue. It amounted to US$2.15 billion, up from US$1.55 billion a year ago, while subscription solutions revenue totalled US$699 million, up from US$610 million in the same quarter last year. Looking forward to the upcoming holiday season, Shopify said it expects its fourth-quarter revenue to grow at a percentage rate in the mid-to-high twenties on a year-over-year basis. The numbers will reflect a shift Finkelstein has seen in Black Friday and Cyber Monday. “It used to be a few peak sales days, but now it stretches across the whole quarter and it’s more global than ever,” he said.

"“It’ll happen slowly, and then all at once.” That’s how Jim Morrow, founder and chief investment officer of Callodine Capital, describes the eventual – inevitable – unwinding of what he calls “the most crowded trade in history.” Of course, he isn’t just paraphrasing Ernest Hemingway—he’s talking about the AI race, and the trillion-dollar deals so overstretched they’re better described as knots than trades. And he’s not alone in sounding alarms. Michael Burry—the investor of Big Short fame who famously predicted the 2008 housing collapse—broke a two-year silence this week to say nearly the same thing: that Big Tech’s AI-era profits are built on “one of the most common frauds in the modern era”—stretching the depreciation schedule (some, including Burry, would say cheating the depreciation schedule). And it landed with extra weight: earlier this week, Burry quietly deregistered his investing firm, Scion Asset Management, effectively stepping away from managing outside money or filing public disclosures. Some analysts interpreted the move as less of an ominous sign and more, as Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, told CNBC, stepping away “from a game he believes is fundamentally rigged.” “On to much better things,” Burry hinted on X, with a new launch expected on November 25. Freed from the obligations of reporting and client management, Burry returned to X with a message that cut straight through the current AI euphoria. To him, the boom in GPUs, data centers, and trillion-dollar AI bets isn’t evidence of unstoppable growth; it’s evidence of a financial cycle that looks increasingly distorted, increasingly crowded, and increasingly fragile. Burry put numbers to it. In a post on X, the investor estimated that Big Tech will understate depreciation by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028, inflating reported profits by 26.9% at Oracle and 20.8% at Meta, to name two of his specific targets. Meta did not respond to a request for comment. Oracle declined to comment. “He’s spot on,” Morrow tells Fortune. Morrow has been making the arguments for months, warning that a “tsunami of depreciation” could quietly flatten Big Tech’s AI profits. Behind the trillion-dollar boom in chips, data centers, and model training, he argues, lies a simple but powerful illusion: companies have quietly changed the length of time they account for their machines—and their semiconductor chips—wearing out and depreciating. “Companies are very aware of it,” Morrow claims. “They’ve gone to great lengths to change their accounting and depreciation schedules to get ahead of it—to effectively avoid all this capex hitting their income statements.” Burry’s post drew viral attention. Morrow’s been making the case longer, but he thinks the sudden resonance means investors are finally waking up to something fundamental. “These aren’t small numbers—they’re huge. And the fact that someone like Burry is calling it out tells you people are starting to notice what’s happening between the lines of the balance sheet.” The great depreciation stretch Here’s how depreciation works—or doesn’t. When tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Oracle build AI data centers, they buy tens of billions of dollars in GPUs, servers, and cooling systems. Normally, those assets lose value fast, cutting into profits. But recently, Burry claims, many companies quietly extended how long they claim those machines last—from roughly three years to as many as six. That simple change lets them spread out their costs and report fatter earnings now. “Had they not made those changes,” Morrow says, “their earnings would be dramatically lower.” Meta’s filings, for one, seem to at least corroborate the directionality of Burry’s and Morrow’s claim. Until 2024, servers and network gear were depreciated over four to five years; effective January 2025, Meta said they would “extend the estimated useful lives” of “certain servers and network assets” to 5.5 years. “Depreciation expense on property and equipment,” Meta wrote in its annual filing for 2022, was “$8.50 billion, $7.56 billion, and $6.39 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.” In other words: depreciation was a major cost already, and management clearly chose to stretch the timeline over which those costs are recognized. The policy change doesn’t prove Burry’s dollar totals across firms, but it markedly moves reported earnings in the direction he describes by lowering near-term depreciation expense and pushing more of it into later years. Morrow argues that the timing makes little sense. As the pace of technological change accelerates—Nvidia now releases new chips every 12 to 18 months instead of every two years—the hardware becomes obsolete faster, not slower. It’s like any old technology. Take laptops: imagine trying to run the newest version of Adobe Premiere Pro on a 2018 MacBook. Sure, it might boot up, but it’s going to overheat, lag, or crash, because it simply wasn’t built for today’s compute demands. Old chips are the same way: they don’t stop working, but they quickly lose their economic value as newer, faster models render them functionally obsolete, Morrow argues. To be sure, Morrow’s expertise is in value investing and high dividend companies, as opposed to the trendier, high-growth tech stocks: in fact, he said he has no long positions in technology broadly. So, he benefits if Big Tech multiples compress or if the markets begin to reprice the costs buried in AI spending. Still, his critique aligns with growing unease from other analysts. Richard Jarc, an analyst at Uncovered Alpha, has raised similar alarms about the mismatch between AI chip lifecycles and corporate accounting. He has said that the latest generation of GPUs wears out far faster than companies’ amortization schedules suggest. While some point to the continued use of Nvidia’s H100 chips—released three years ago—as evidence of longer utility, Jarc says that’s misleading. Demand remains high largely because a handful of companies are subsidizing compute costs for end users, a dynamic that depends on investor cash flow rather than fundamentals, Jarc argues. More importantly, Nvidia has now shifted from releasing new chips every 18–24 months to an annual cadence. In that context, Jarc said, treating GPUs as if they’ll remain valuable for five or six years is unrealistic: their true economic life, he estimates, is closer to one or two. The Economist in Sept. called the delayed depreciation “the $4 trillion accounting puzzle at the heart of the AI cloud,” noting that Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle have each extended the useful life of their servers even as Nvidia shortens its chip cycle to one year. By The Economist’s estimates, if those assets were depreciated over three years instead of the longer timelines companies now assume, annual pre-tax profits would fall by $26 billion, roughly an 8% hit. A two-year schedule would double that loss, and if depreciation truly matched Nvidia’s pace, the implied market value hit could reach $4 trillion. Not everyone buys the doom loop. In a note to clients sent this week, Bank of America’s semiconductor team argued that the market’s sudden skepticism about AI capex is evidence that the trade is far less overcrowded than credits claim. The recent selloff in megacap AI names, the team led by Vivek Arya wrote, was driven by “correctable macro factors”—shutdown jitters, weak jobs data, tariff confusion, even misinterpreted OpenAI comments—rather than any real deterioration in AI demand. In fact, the firm pointed to surging ancillary segments like memory and optical (up 14% last week), as well as Nvidia’s disclosure of $500 billion-plus in 2025–26 data-center orders, as signs the underlying spending cycle remains “robust.” Growth or just capital intensity? But Morrow is most worried that investors are mistaking raw spending for real growth. The market, he argues, have stopped distinguishing between capital intensity and genuine productivity. The AI boom has pushed valuations from the realm of software multiples into something closer to industrial-scale infrastructure math. Building just one hyperscale, one-gigawatt data center—enough to support a cutting-edge AI model—can run around $50 billion, with the majority devoted to GPUs, followed by the buildings, cooling systems, and power infrastructure. Reality check—“none of these companies has ever managed a $50 billion project before,” he says. “Now they’re trying to do fifty of them at once.” The irony, he adds, is that many of those facilities can’t even run yet. Data centers across Santa Clara and Northern Virginia are sitting idle, waiting for grid hookups that could take years. “Every month a $35 billion stack of GPUs sits without power, that’s a billion dollars of depreciation just burning a hole in the balance sheet,” he says. “So of course they’re panicking — and ordering their own turbines.” He thinks the result will be a massive power glut by the late 2020s: an overbuilt grid, over-leveraged utilities, and ratepayers stuck with the bill. “We’ve seen this movie before—in shale, in fiber, in railroads,” he says. “Every capital-spending boom ends the same way: overcapacity, low returns, and a bailout.” The biggest risk, he says, is that investors have stopped looking at balance sheets entirely. He points to the sheer concentration of today’s market: nearly half of all 401(k) money now effectively tied to six megacaps. “This is the most crowded trade in history,” he says. “When it turns, it’s going to turn fast.”",right
"Algoma Steel to Cut 40% of Staff as Tariffs Crush Sales Canadian steelmaker Algoma Steel Group Inc. will let go of 1,000 employees and close its blast furnace in northern Ontario within months as it seeks to stem losses resulting from US tariffs. Canadian steelmaker Algoma Steel Group Inc. will let go of 1,000 employees and close its blast furnace in northern Ontario within months as it seeks to stem losses resulting from United States tariffs. The company, based in the city of Sault Ste. Marie, is also shuttering its coke-making operation as it plans to transition to making steel solely by electric-arc furnace in early 2026, a year ahead of schedule, Algoma said Monday in an emailed statement. The Trump administration’s 50 per cent tariffs on foreign steel “have fundamentally altered the competitive landscape and sharply limited our ability to access the U.S. market,” spokesperson Laura Devoni said in the statement. Algoma’s stock fell 6.4 per cent at 3 p.m. in New York. Algoma’s sales dropped 13 per cent in the third quarter and it reported a direct tariff expense of $89.7 million in that period, saying the U.S. steel market had become “largely closed to us.” The company, which currently has about 2,500 employees, was given $500 million in emergency loans from the governments of Canada and Ontario. The layoffs come into effect on March 23. “This transition is necessary to protect Algoma’s future in the face of these extraordinary and external market forces, and we will continue to advocate for a competitive and fair trading environment for Canadian steel,” Algoma said. Industry Minister Melanie Joly said Monday in Parliament that the government will continue working with the Algoma employees affected by the “unjustified and unjustifiable tariffs imposed by the White House” and vowed support for the steelmaker as it develops new products and accesses new markets.

"Steel: 50%. Copper: 50%. Cars: up to 25%. But an even bigger Trump-era levy looms: 107 % on Italian pasta. Mamma mia. It started with the U.S. Commerce Department launching what it says was a routine antidumping review, based on allegations Italian pasta makers sold product into the US at below-market prices and undercut local competitors. That has led to a threat of 92% duties, which would come on top of the 15% tariff President Donald Trump’s administration imposed on European exports generally. The news sent shockwaves through Italy, where 13 producers would be subject to the whopping one-two punch. They say sales in their second biggest export market would shrivel if prices to American consumers more than double. And while the measure would hardly prompt pasta shortages, it still has perplexed importers like Sal Auriemma, whose shop in Philadelphia’s Italian market, Claudio Specialty Food, has been operating for over 60 years. “Pasta is a pretty small sector to pick on. I mean, there’s a lot bigger things to pick on,” said Auriemma, pointing to luxury items as an alternative. But pasta? “It’s basic food,” he said. “Something’s got to be sacred.” Pasta adds heft to Italy’s economy Italy is a nation of avid pasta eaters. Less known is that most of the tortellini, spaghetti and rigatoni its factories churn out gets sent abroad. The U.S. accounts for about 15% of its €4 billion ($4.65 billion) in exports, making it Italy’s largest market after Germany, data from farmers’ association Coldiretti show. The punitive pasta premium has become a cause célèbre for Italy’s politicians, executives and economists. Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida told lawmakers in mid-October that the government was working with the European Commission and engaging in diplomatic efforts, while supporting the companies’ legal actions to oppose U.S. sanctions. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic addressed reporters in Rome last month, stressing the lack of evidence backing the U.S. decision and calling the combined 107% levy “unacceptable.” Margherita Mastromauro, president of the pasta makers sector of Unione Italiana Food, told The Associated Press that prices for Italian pasta in the U.S. remain high, and certainly higher than American-made rivals — undermining any dumping claim. She said that the measures could deal a fatal blow to small- and medium-sized producers. Lucio Miranda, president of consultancy group Export USA, agreed. “A duty rate of 107% would definitely kill this flow of export,” Miranda, who is Italian, said by phone from New York. “It’s not going to be something that you can just dump on the consumer and move on, life continues. It will definitely be a deal killer.” Wacky Mac owner cries foul The Commerce Department’s investigation started in 2024 after complaints from Missouri-based 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, which owns pasta brand Ronzoni, and Illinois-based Winland Foods, whose multiple brands include Prince, Mueller’s and Wacky Mac. The office’s review focused on La Molisana and Garofalo, chosen as primary respondents because they are Italy’s two largest exporters, the Commerce Department said in an emailed statement. Any sale price below either producers’ costs or the price they charge in the Italian market would be considered dumping, in line with numerous other reviews of Italian pasta since 1996, it said. The two companies presented information incorrectly or withheld it, significantly impeding analysis, according to the Commerce Department. And in the face of these alleged deficiencies, the office presented its 92% duty estimate, which it extended to 11 other companies based on an assumption the two companies’ behavior was representative. “After they screwed up their initial responses, the Commerce Department explained to them what the problems were and asked them to fix those problems; they didn’t,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in an emailed response to the AP’s questions. “And then Commerce communicated the requirements again, and they didn’t answer for a third time.” La Molisana declined to comment when contacted by the AP. Garofalo didn’t respond to a request for comment. The sanctions would be applied not just to imports going forward, but also the 12 months through June 2024, according to the Commerce Department. It added that only 16% of total Italian pasta imports may be affected. Its final decision is scheduled for Jan. 2, which could be extended by 60 days. ‘Completely senseless’ A little over an hour’s drive northeast from Naples is Benevento, a sleepy hilltop town of 55,000 people famed for its ancient Roman theater and Aglianico red wine. It’s also home to Pasta Rummo, founded in 1846, which prides itself on its seven-phase, “slow work” production method. CEO Cosimo Rummo is outraged by the threat to his company’s annual 20 million euros in exports to the U.S. “These tariffs are completely senseless,” Rummo said in a phone interview. “These are fast-moving consumer goods … Who would ever buy a pack of pasta that costs 10 dollars, the same price as a bottle of wine?” He added that he has no intention to start producing pasta stateside, as some companies have done and so would be spared the prospective levy. That includes Barilla, which for decades has been the main Italian pasta brand in the U.S. and now has large-scale production facilities there. An unsavory prospect When the transatlantic imbroglio started simmering, Robert Tramonte of Arlington, Virginia sought assurances. The owner of The Italian Store called his supplier, who told him there’s enough pasta inventory stocked in the warehouse to keep prices steady until Easter. Tramonte’s clients count on him for top-shelf product and he was relieved that, at least for the time being, they won’t have to shell out for the real deal. Or worse — perish the thought! — purchase made-in-America pasta. “They’ve tried to make Italian products and use the same ingredients, but the source wasn’t Italy,” he said. “And they just didn’t taste the same.”",right
"Posthaste: Cracks are appearing around the edges of Canada's credit world Delinquencies are rising at the nation's medium-sized banks, says Morningstar DBRS Canadians have come out of the pandemic borrowing binge remarkably well, weathering a steep climb in interest rates, an unsteady economy and rising unemployment. Though the Bank of Canada has reduced its rate to 2.25 per cent, it still remains higher than it has been for the past 15 years, outside of the pandemic. Nor has the wave of mortgage renewals off pandemic lows yet reached its peak. CIBC Capital Markets expects that in the second half of next year the share of borrowers facing payment shocks of more than 40 per cent will hit 5 to 6 per cent of the mortgage portfolio, more than double the share in 2025. Yet so far there has been no signs of trouble in insolvency rates, which have stabilized at levels seen before the pandemic. It’s at the margins of the credit world that observers are beginning to notice the strain. In a report this month Morningstar DBRS warned that mortgage delinquencies are rising at Canada’s medium-sized banks. These smaller banks, which offer an alternative to borrowers unable to get a loan at one of Canada’s Big Six, held $67.6 billion in residential mortgages as of June, 2025. DBRS said still high interest rates and rising unemployment have contributed to the credit deterioration and tariff uncertainty has amplified those pressures, particularly in Ontario and British Columbia, where housing prices have fallen the most. Of the rated mid-sized banks, Fairstone Bank of Canada and subsidiary Home Trust Company, and Equitable Bank are showing the most strain, while Laurentian Bank of Canada has shown resiliency, said DBRS. According to their calculations, Fairstone’s mortgage impairment ratio hit 2.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2025, up from 0.3 per cent at the end of 2022 and Equitable’s rose to 1.1 per cent from 0.2 per cent. “Heading into 2026, we anticipate credit pressures to continue as mortgage rates are still high and tariff uncertainty persists, affecting overall market sentiment,” said DBRS. - Here's how Canada's pension system ranks against the rest of the world's - Why economists are cutting their forecasts for the Canadian dollar - Advertisement 1Story continues below Another report looking at the quality of Canadian household credit by CIBC deputy-chief economist Benjamin Tal also warns of pressures building at the margins. Early-stage delinquencies in below-prime mortgages are now well above pre-COVID levels, and there are signs that homeowners are struggling with non-mortgage debt such as credit cards and lines of credit. “This does not bode well for the mortgage portfolio, mainly in the second half of 2026 when we expect the impact of mortgage refinancing payment shocks to be much more visible, said Tal. The 90+ day delinquency rate of borrowers with no mortgage debt has also been rising and is now 0.2 per cent higher than before COVID. “Given where we are in the economic cycle, we doubt that that rate will start trending downward any time soon. In fact, the opposite is the case,” said Tal. Tal expects delinquency rates to rise in coming quarters, but further credit losses should be contained by unemployment hitting a peak and lenders taking pre-emptive action. Morningstar DBRS also said despite increased impairments, actual loan losses have remained manageable. “In our view, generally good underwriting practices, low uninsured LTVs (loan-to-value ratios), and adequate reserve levels provide a sufficient cushion in this challenging environment,” the report said.

Canada’s economy shrank in August, missing expectations, but an estimate of 0.1 per cent growth in September should keep us out of recession. With the second quarter in the red, contraction in the third would qualify as a technical recession. But now it looks like the economy, though weakened by U.S. tariffs, should eke out some gains. Though the August gross domestic product figures were disappointing, they are not likely enough to press the Bank of Canada back into action, say economists. After cutting its rate to 2.25 per cent last week, the central bank said it was probably done if the economy performed as it expected. Statistics Canada said Friday that GDP is on track to grow by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter. The Bank of Canada’s forecast is 0.5 per cent, but governor Tiff Macklem warned the weak growth will “not feel good.” - Earnings: Franco-Nevada Corp., Kinross Gold Corp., Loews Corp., Topaz Energy Corp.

"New Delhi: The commerce ministry has already started the work to frame detailed guidelines for the Rs 25,060 crore Export Promotion Mission (EPM) and it will start releasing them from this month, a top official said on Monday. The government on November 12 approved the EPM with an outlay of Rs 25,060 crore for six financial years, beginning 2025-26, a move which will help exporters deal with high tariffs imposed by the US. The mission will be implemented through two sub-schemes -- Niryat Protsahan (Rs 10,401 crore) and Niryat Disha (Rs 14,659 crore). ""On export promotion mission, we are already working on these. Many sub-committees are in place which are looking at the detailed guidelines of each of these components. ""We will start releasing them within this month itself. If not all, we will have major portion of these guidelines coming out by the end of this month,"" Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal told reporters here. Under the mission, priority support will be extended to sectors impacted by recent global tariff escalations, such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, and marine products. These sectors are facing challenges in the US market. Due to the high import duties, India's merchandise exports to the US declined 8.58 per cent to USD 6.3 billion in October. The US has imposed a hefty 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods from August 27. Meanwhile, the two countries are negotiating a bilateral trade agreement. Through this mission, the secretary said that the government is trying to address all aspects of trade finance for exporters. The commerce ministry has said that the mission marks a strategic shift from multiple fragmented schemes to a single, outcome-based, and adaptive mechanism that can respond swiftly to global trade challenges and evolving exporter needs. Under Niryat Protsahan, it said, focus will be given to improve access to affordable trade finance for MSMEs through a range of instruments such as interest subvention, export factoring, collateral guarantees, credit cards for e-commerce exporters, and credit enhancement support for diversification into new markets. Similarly, under Niryat Disha, the funds will be used for non-financial enablers such as assistance for international branding, packaging, and participation in trade fairs, export warehousing and logistics, inland transport reimbursements, and trade intelligence and capacity-building initiatives.

"President Trump’s recent proposal to pay Americans “at least $2,000 a person” from new tariff revenue—a policy he calls “tariff dividends”—is facing sharp criticism from a budget watchdog, who calculates that the plan will actually lose twice as much money for the country as the tariffs are generating. Writing in a weekend post on Truth Social, Trump argued that tariff revenues could be redistributed directly to individuals in the form of annual payments, with “high income people” excluded from the payouts. The idea, pitched as a way both to reward taxpayers and possibly reduce the national debt, bears a strong resemblance to the structure of the COVID-era Economic Impact Payments, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). But the numbers reveal a steep fiscal challenge. The CRFB estimates that distributing just a single round of $2,000 payments to Americans—calculated to match the COVID payments, which included both adults and children—would cost the federal government around $600 billion per year. By contrast, the tariffs that Trump has championed have raised about $100 billion to date and, even accounting for pending legal cases, are only projected to raise about $300 billion annually going forward. Deficits could skyrocket “If tariff dividends are paid annually, deficits would increase by $6 trillion over ten years,” the CRFB writes, “roughly twice as much as President Trump’s tariffs are estimated to raise over the same time period.” This means not only that the revenue from tariffs would fail to cover dividend payouts, but also that the policy would exacerbate America’s long-term fiscal challenges. To put the numbers in perspective, if dividends were paid out on a “revenue neutral” basis—matching payouts to actual tariff revenue—the analysis estimates that payments could be made only every other year, starting in early 2027. Should the Supreme Court uphold current lower court rulings that have deemed some of Trump’s tariffs illegal, remaining tariffs would only cover the dividend payments once every seven years. Debt implications Beyond blowing past the revenue generated, diverting all tariff proceeds to pay these dividends would restrict the government’s ability to use tariff income for reducing deficits or paying down debt, as some administration officials have proposed. The CRFB warns that using all tariff revenue for rebates would push federal debt to 127% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2035, compared to 120% under current law. If $2,000 dividends were paid annually, that figure could jump further, reaching 134% of GDP over the same period. Such projections come at a time when annual budget deficits are nearing $2 trillion and national debt is quickly approaching an all-time high, making fiscal discipline a top concern for watchdogs and policy analysts. Trump’s proposal draws inspiration from pandemic-era Economic Impact Payments (EIPs), but those measures were carefully income-tested to phase out payments for individuals earning over $75,000 and joint filers over $150,000. The CRFB said its analysis used similar eligibility parameters for its cost estimate, suggesting that without strict limits, the fiscal hit could be even higher.

"Reversals of fortune are nothing new for Bitcoin diehards — euphoric rallies, then brutal selloffs. They happen every few years, or whenever sentiment snaps. None of those previous episodes, though, have prepared traders for the speed and scale of the past few weeks, in a reversal that was sharper than expected even if it lacked the systemic stress of prior crashes. Friday’s drop sent Bitcoin to a low near $80,500, putting it on track for its worst month since Terra’s $60 billion collapse in 2022 set off the bankruptcies that ended in FTX. Altogether, some half a trillion dollars in Bitcoin value has been wiped out. And that’s before tallying the carnage across the altcoin complex. Bitcoin is still comfortably up since President Donald Trump’s November victory, but much of the heady run has vanished in his first year back in office, the very stretch he hailed as crypto’s golden age. Most of the losses remain on paper. But for the first time since exchange-traded funds helped bring Wall Street and retail into the market, those positions are under pressure. The spark this time around is harder to spot. These new ETFs didn’t exist during the last big crypto crash. Investors have pulled billions from the 12 Bitcoin-linked funds this month, Bloomberg data show, with past buyers including Harvard’s endowment and several hedge funds. The slew of digital-asset treasury companies — publicly traded crypto holding vehicles, inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. — have seen even steeper outflows as investors question the value of corporate shells built solely to hold tokens. What’s clear is that crypto has become much bigger than the retail traders and techno futurists who are committed to HODLing through thick and thin. Now it has become woven into the fabric of Wall Street and the broader public markets, bringing a whole new set of finicky players to the table. “What’s happened these last two months was like rocket fuel, as if people were expecting this to crash,” said Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at Copper Technologies Ltd. “That’s what institutional investors do. They’re not there to hold, they don’t have that mentality. They rebalance their portfolio.” Bitcoin remains up roughly 50% from its pre-election low. And the scale of this pullback still pales next to its 75% collapse during the 2021–2022 bear market. That hints at how much deeper the pain could still go. Back then, each leg down exposed another major player — from Celsius to BlockFi to Three Arrows. Flash Crash But with no obvious blowups or scandals this time, some traders think the current drop is more about technicals and confidence than systemic cracks. “We aren’t following the same path down; overall macro conditions, government support, and fewer bad actors in the space make today’s market more resilient,” said Luke Youngblood, founder of lending platform Moonwell. “The foundations crypto is building on are stronger, even if there are causes for concern down the line.” The clearest catalyst was a flash crash on Oct. 10 in which $19 billion of crypto bets were liquidated in a matter of hours. The event exposed the chronic lack of liquidity during weekend trading — the flipside to crypto’s famed 24-7 trading schedule — as well as a build-up of excessive leverage on certain exchanges, knocking Bitcoin from the all-time high of $126,251 that it had reached just days earlier. “To some extent, we believe a lot of the decline in crypto markets is due to what happened on 10/10,” Brett Knoblauch and Gareth Gacetta, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., wrote in a Thursday note. “It feels as if some big players in the space are being forced to sell, as what happened on 10/10 might have had a far-larger impact on balance sheets than initially thought.” The problem hasn’t quite died out yet either. Liquidity in crypto markets remains low, with market makers weakened by the crash unable to step in and support prices. Around $1.6 billion in bets were liquidated across exchanges on Friday, according to Coinglass data, as the latest drop hit leveraged traders. Bitcoin’s gold-like mystique — always a big stretch — has faded. Gold has held its ground. Crypto remains a proxy for fast-twitch risk appetite — and it’s reacting faster than the market around it. This week, Bitcoin got caught up in topsy-turvy trading in technology stocks, with the token’s volatility being pointed to as both the cause and effect of equities turmoil. On Thursday, for example, the S&P 500 rose early in the day, bolstered by strong earnings from Nvidia Corp., before suffering its biggest intraday reversal since the April tariff turmoil. Analysts at Nomura blamed crypto, among other causes. Bill Ackman floated an unusual link — suggesting Fannie and Freddie holdings were behaving like a crypto proxy. Crypto’s fate is now tied to AI-fueled market optimism. With bubble chatter building, it won’t take much to spook investors into selling. There are also plenty of dangers lurking within the crypto ecosystem. The Saylor copycats have been built on the belief that a public company that does nothing but hold crypto can be worth more than the value of the tokens it holds. The push to repurpose public firms into crypto treasuries has endured to this point in the downturn — echoing the overleveraged lenders of 2022. If confidence cracks, forced selling could follow. Many are already underwater on their token holdings. “When you’ve got a medical device company or a cancer research firm rebranding as a crypto treasury, it’s a sign of where you are in the cycle,” said Adam Morgan McCarthy, senior research analyst at blockchain data firm Kaiko. Overall, any positive vibes left in the industry appear to be hurtling toward rock bottom. The Fear and Greed index — a tool that measures sentiment in crypto markets — sat at a score of 11 out of 100 on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap. That’s deep in “extreme fear” territory. “Fear sentiment has spiked to relative highs while structural demand for spot remains notably absent, leaving the market without the natural buyers typically present during significant corrections,” said Chris Newhouse, director of research at Ergonia, a firm specializing in decentralized finance.",right
"EXCLUSIVE: While Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman weighs a gubernatorial bid, Gov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., is reportedly considering a corporate tax hike – a move the New York Republican described to Fox News Digital as a ""tax on the middle class."" Blakeman said a decision about his political future is coming ""very soon"" as he travels across New York state to determine if he has the ""support to get to the next level."" But as Blakeman mulls his political future, he is sounding the alarm on Hochul for reportedly planning to raise taxes on corporations to shore up funds for the state's budget gap and to deliver on Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's socialist campaign agenda, according to Politico. ""This is a tax on the middle class,"" Blakeman told Fox News Digital. ""It will make things less affordable. It will drive up inflation, and it will make New York less competitive. Corporations are already leaving our state in record numbers. Jobs are leaving our state. People are leaving our state. This corporate tax increase will drive more high net-worth individuals and corporations out of New York State and will be an economic disaster."" NEW YORK LEADER PLEDGES MORE COPS, TOUGHER ICE PARTNERSHIP IF NYC ELECTS SOCIALIST MAYOR Kyle Strober, executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, the region's leading economic development advocacy organization, told Fox News Digital that a corporate tax increase could be ""potentially devastating"" to Long Island's economy. STEFANIK DECRIES HOCHUL AS 'WORST GOVERNOR IN AMERICA' IN FIERY 2026 CAMPAIGN LAUNCH ""Long Island, whose economy is closely aligned with New York City, is already confronting multiple challenges, including high taxes, high costs of living, and a lack of housing driving potential employees and employers outside the region,"" Strober said, adding that a corporate tax hike would ""only serve to drive away additional businesses and high-income earners, who pay the majority of the state’s tax revenue."" ""When this occurs, the tax burden is shifted to Long Island’s hard working middle class. It becomes self-evident that this tax proposal would fly in direct conflict of making New York more affordable for our middle class, a stated goal of Albany leadership,"" he explained. The ABLI led efforts in 2021 and 2025 to oppose tax hike proposals out of Albany, particularly tax hikes on the top 1% of New Yorkers and raising the corporate tax rate. Hochul has faced pressure from the socialist wing of the Democratic Party to raise taxes so Mamdani can deliver on his ambitious campaign promises, including fast and free buses, universal childcare and city-run grocery stores. Mamdani campaigned on raising taxes on the top 1% of New Yorkers and hiking up the state's corporate tax from 7.25% to 11.5% to match the rate in New Jersey. Any tax hikes would require Hochul's approval in Albany. MAMDANI LAUGHS OFF CRITICISM THAT HIS TAX HIKE PROPOSALS WILL COMPEL NEW YORKERS TO FLEE While the comparably moderate governor endorsed Mamdani after he secured the Democratic nomination, Hochul has maintained that she won't raise taxes on the top 1% of New Yorkers – despite Mamdani's supporters heckling Hochul to ""Tax the rich!"" ""This has become a one-party state ruled by the far-left, woke, progressive part of the Democratic Party, now led by Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City, who is an avowed social democrat,"" Blakeman said, charging that Mamdani sounds like a ""communist."" ""He is anti-American values,"" Blakeman said. ""He is against business. He will destroy the economy of the greatest financial city in the world, the financial capital of the world: New York City. And that will have a material effect on my county, which borders New York City."" Blakeman said Hochul raising taxes on corporations would be a ""disaster."" And when asked how the state should approach Mamdani following his election night success, Blakeman said Republican leadership needs to step up and ""push back"" in New York state. ""When he wants to do crazy things, like give free bus rides to everybody, which will be nothing more than homeless shelters on wheels, when he doesn't want to prosecute criminals for committing crimes, when he wants to increase taxes and increase the corporate tax rate, and he wants the tax the rich, which will drive people out of New York State, and they'll take jobs with them, we have to push back."" While New York City handed power to its far-left flank on Election Day, neighboring Nassau County re-elected Blakeman, an ally of President Donald Trump. ""I won because I adhered to American values, American principles. I didn't raise taxes a penny in four years. I hired 600 new law enforcement professionals. I declared Nassau County wasn't a sanctuary county. I showed leadership and I reached out to communities that in the past, the Republican Party has ignored,"" Blakeman said, explaining how he built a broad coalition of support among diverse communities. When reached for comment, Hochul campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika told Fox News Digital that the governor has ""cut middle class taxes while putting inflation refund checks in New Yorkers’ pockets."" ""Bruce Blakeman is the number one fanboy for Trump’s tariffs that are raising costs for families and making everything more expensive for small businesses – while the governor remains laser-focused on lowering costs, Blakeman’s shilling for Donald Trump’s tariff tax hikes,"" Chitika charged. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Since winning his re-election earlier this month, Blakeman said business and political leaders have encouraged him to launch a campaign for governor, given his executive experience. But while rumors swirl about Blakeman's political future, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., another Trump loyalist, has already launched her gubernatorial campaign and secured support from New York Republican Party Chair Ed Cox and 36 New York conservative county chairs.",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format There has been longstanding confusion about how a $2,000 “tariff dividend” would be delivered to American families. Any such large cash payout would need approval from Congress, and some Republicans have already opposed the idea. ALSO READ: US citizens to receive IRS stimulus checks in November 2025 and $2,000 tariff dividend checks? Check the latest update Stimulus checks for Americans soon? So far, tariffs imposed under Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) have brought in only about $90 billion through September 23, according to the US Customs and Border Protection. That amount is far below what a national stimulus check program would require.For comparison, a COVID-era plan to send $2,000 checks to families was estimated to cost $464 billion. Even limiting the payments to households earning under $100,000 would still cost about $300 billion, according to Erica York of the Tax Foundation. There are also concerns that if the Supreme Court rules against Trump’s use of IEEPA tariffs, the government might have to return some money to importers. Overall, the U.S. collected about $195.9 billion in tariffs during fiscal year 2025 through August 31. Bessent said the administration “inherited this affordability disaster” and the worst inflation in decades. He added that no final decision has been made on the structure of Trump’s stimulus proposal. Instead of direct checks, the “dividend” could be delivered as tax relief targeted at Americans earning under $100,000. ALSO READ: Jeffrey Epstein’s chilling email before suicide mentioned Trump? Here's what the disgraced financer wrote Economists warn that the federal budget may not be able to support cash payments. York estimates the new tariffs could raise nearly $217 billion by 2026 — still far short of the roughly $300 billion needed to provide $2,000 payments to the 123 million households earning below $100,000. Is there enough tariff revenue? The White House's proposal to use tariff revenues to fund a $2,000 dividend check for millions of low- and middle-income Americans has become the focus of economic and political debate. Although the measure has undeniable appeal to voters frustrated by the cost of living, economists and financial analysts warn that the logic behind this initiative is flawed, especially with regard to its financing and potential inflationary impact.Donald Trump's controversial proposal suggests a payment of at least $2,000 for most US citizens, funded by revenue generated from his tariff policies. The proposal must go through an approval process, but even before that, many experts say that it has no support or economic backing, as there is no budget to finance this proposal. ALSO READ: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS puzzles scientists again: Cosmic visitor's survival behind the Sun points to possible alien origin? Check details The biggest challenge to the proposal is basic math. Analysts estimate that sending $2,000 to about 150 million lower-income adults would cost roughly $300 billion. Customs revenue has grown — reaching nearly $195 billion in the last fiscal year — but the money raised from the new tariffs is far smaller, at around $120 billion so far. Economists say this makes it highly unlikely that the promised $2,000 checks could be paid for using tariff revenue alone.

"Starmer Girds for Six-Month Fight to Save His Premiership Keir Starmer has six months to prove his mettle to his party amid swirling doubts within the governing Labour Party that he can reverse plunging public confidence in his UK administration. (Bloomberg) — Keir Starmer has six months to prove his mettle to his party amid swirling doubts within the governing Labour Party that he can reverse plunging public confidence in his UK administration. The prime minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves survived a budget statement this week that did just about enough to avoid a reckoning with the markets and Labour Members of Parliament. But with voters turning their backs on Labour, at some point his party will decide whether to stick with him, or twist. Ministers and aides told Bloomberg that Starmer needs to convince his lawmakers and the public before local elections in May that “Starmerism” can be a vote winner. Speaking anonymously about party ructions, some close to the premier fear a move against him in the new year, before one potential challenger, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, has an opportunity to return to Parliament. What’s clear is Starmer can ill-afford his approach to continue to be what internal critics say is an incoherent mess, as typified by a chaotic run-up to the budget. As the year draws to a close, Labour MPs are asking themselves whether Starmer can stop the rot. Pollsters are doubtful. “It’s very unlikely, if history is anything to go by, that Starmer, Reeves and the government as it stands will be able to turn this around,” YouGov’s head of political data, Patrick English, told Bloomberg Radio on Friday. “The majority of voters will get the chance to vote in May and at the minute, as far as we can tell, they’re preparing to give the government a right good kicking.” Certainly the budget didn’t seem to please voters, with many left feeling forgotten. Polling in the aftermath suggest the British public has completely lost confidence in the Starmer-Reeves project. The Labour government which swept to power in a landslide election win just 16 months ago has so far pursued an awkward mash of competing ideas. There were big election promises to prioritize growth and investment that suggested Starmer might be the heir to former premier Tony Blair. He’s also poured a lot of energy into international affairs, with a focus on security and the war in Ukraine. This year, his government has toughened its messaging around migration and crime: an approach espoused by Starmer’s top aide, Morgan McSweeney, aimed at stopping the working class falling to populism. There’s also been some more typically Labour re-distributive social democracy, with taxes on the rich and higher public spending, as well as increased welfare spending forced in part on the government by rebellious Labour backbenchers who rejected attempts to curb spending on disability benefits and winter fuel payments to pensioners. Many inside Labour have asked which is the real Starmer. Some posited that Reeves’ budget, broadly seen as a tilt to the left, may be a sign of a permanent political shift from Downing Street to shore up his position. They may be disappointed. Those close to the premier say don’t expect him to pick a side. Starmer’s allies said bridging different ideas is the key to success for a progressive leader in a world dominated by President Donald Trump, and in a country with huge structural economic problems. Any leader who doesn’t push on all these fronts will fail, one argued. That approach featuring a long list of U-turns frustrates many within the party, who see it as lacking vision or direction. The run-up to the budget — including a retreat from plans to raise income tax — was described by government officials as hellish and shambolic, and compounded the sense ministers aren’t fully in control of the narrative. Reeves’ package itself left Blairites and some of those previously allied to McSweeney less enthused about a budget without a growth plan. That’s not without risk as Health Secretary Wes Streeting emerges as a leadership contender on Starmer’s right flank. It looks like the pre-election pitch to back growth and business is out of the window, though there will be a fresh push in these areas in the coming weeks, a government official said. Only a few weeks back, it was Burnham and the so-called soft-left sharpening their knives calling for a government with more Labour values. They won’t go away, especially if the May elections are brutal and Reeves comes after the welfare budget again. One Starmer ally said he isn’t lurching between different factions, he’s trying to work with them all. Another sought to highlight Starmer’s successes on the international scene, saying it was no small achievement to have helped hold Trump back from the brink of siding with Russian President Vladimir Putin in seeking a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. Nevertheless, Starmer’s inner circle knows things haven’t gone well domestically, and are seeking more robust arguments for what he is trying to do. The premier will make an unashamedly Labour case that paying more tax is worth it for better public services, an aide said. Starmer said on Thursday that the budget had “asked everybody to make a contribution” to protect public services and help people struggling with the cost of living. “I’m not going to apologize for lifting half a million children out of poverty,” he said. The premier also knows it is essential to reform welfare, spark more dynamism in the UK economy, and stop small boats crossing asylum-seekers across the English Channel. His problem is, each time the government pulls in any of these directions, it upsets a Labour faction. No. 10 aides despaired at the perennial criticism, asking who Starmer’s detractors think could do a better job at handling Trump and British populist leader Nigel Farage. Changing leader for either Streeting, Burnham or former deputy premier Angela Rayner would destroy Labour’s mandate and deliver Farage to power, they argued. The officials said there’s still time to turn things around before the next general election, due in mid-2029. But they also fretted that governing is becoming impossible in an age of hyper-cynicism, a total lack of patience and instability caused by international events such as the Ukraine conflict and Trump’s tariff war. Starmer’s inner circle still hopes that in 2026 the prime minister the country and party wants is the decent pragmatist who takes different ideas and tries to make the best of a bad hand. Their fear is that both Labour MPs and voters want something else. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion. Please keep comments relevant and respectful.

"Chicago Boycotts America While the Fed Gets Cooked by San Francisco and Pasta Welcome back to Friday! This is the Breitbart Business Digest weekly wrap, where we review the economic news of the past seven days while sipping on the delicious cocktail of economic vindication mixed with institutional humiliation. The Federal Reserve released research proving its own rate-holding decision was based on a theoretical mistake. Italian pasta makers are confirming that tariffs work through demand destruction, not price inflation. The government shutdown destroyed economic data we might have used to validate or debunk the Fed’s forecast. The Supreme Court is about to reshape central bank independence. And a Chicago politician is using taxpayers’ retirement funds as a campaign billboard while boycotting the safest investment on Earth. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference on September 18, 2024, in Washington, DC. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)I Left My Broken Economic Theory in San Francisco It’s been quite a week for people who believe the Federal Reserve should actually read its own research before making trillion-dollar decisions that affect everyone’s mortgage payments. Jerome Powell, the nation’s central banker, has spent the better part of 2025 explaining why the Fed couldn’t cut interest rates because—and we quote him directly from June—tariffs would “show up more” as “tariff inflation.” Researchers at the San Francisco Fed released a paper this month examining tariff policy from 1870 through 2020 across the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Their conclusion: when countries raise tariffs, inflation actually falls, not rises. A roughly four percentage point increase in average tariffs lowered inflation by about two percentage points while raising unemployment. This isn’t a close call. The pattern held across different time periods—before 1913, the interwar period, post-WWII. Higher tariffs correlated with lower prices and weaker economic activity. Not upward price pressure. Downward. Powell’s entire rationale for holding rates steady—protecting us fragile Americans against tariff-driven inflation—was built on what the Fed’s own research now shows was a foundational misunderstanding. Oopsies! Proof in the Pasta Aisle You want evidence that tariffs don’t raise consumer prices? Look at Italian pasta. Italian pasta makers are facing combined tariffs of 107 percent—92 percent from Commerce Department antidumping duties and 15 percent from Trump’s EU tariff. Rather than raise prices on boxes of rigatoni, they’re preparing to exit the U.S. market entirely. Giuseppe Ferro, CEO of La Molisana, put it bluntly: “No one has those kinds of margins.” In other words, the tariffs cannot be passed on to consumers, and even the importers are not absorbing them. The foreign producers are being forced to mangia the tariffs. By the way, do not blame Trump if your favorite pasta vanishes from the shelves. The huge tariffs the Italians are facing are not Trump’s EU tariff but anti-dumping tariffs imposed by an independent probe. In other words, they would have been applied by any administration. No Data Collection, No Data Reports As everyone knows, the government shutdown lasted six weeks and was the longest in history. Importantly, it lasted through the collection periods for October’s consumer price index and jobs reports. This wasn’t just a delay in releasing data that was already collected. The shutdown prevented the data from being collected at all. The Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys asking households about employment and spending during specific time windows. Apparently, they can’t retroactively ask someone in November about their labor market participation in October. The moment passes. The data vanishes like the Golden Gate Bridge on a foggy day. So, now we’re in the surreal position of having a Fed chair whose entire rate-holding decision was premised on tariff inflation fears—fears that the Fed’s own research just demolished—while missing the very economic data that might have validated or invalidated his forecast. October CPI might never exist. The October jobs report might vanish into the bureaucratic void. The Fed is, as Karoline Leavitt said, “flying blind at a critical period.” Which means Powell made a major monetary policy error based on faulty theory, and we might never get the actual data that would have shown it to him in time. Let Them Cook The Supreme Court this week scheduled arguments for January 21 on whether President Trump can remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Cook has been hanging on since late August, when Trump indicated he wanted her gone over mortgage fraud allegations that she denies. The Court scheduled the case for the last possible date of the January sitting, apparently feeling no sense of urgency about this battle that the media has frequently insisted is an existential crisis for the central bank. There may be more here than meets the eye. In December, the Supreme Court will hear a case that could overturn the 1935 Humphrey’s Executor ruling, which shields agency heads from at-will removal. If SCOTUS overturns that precedent (and recent cases suggest they’re inclined to), Cook’s removal becomes legally straightforward. So, the court may have scheduled Cook’s day in court to follow the death of Humphrey’s Executor. Chicago’s Treasurer Announces She’ll Boycott America Melissa Conyears-Ervin, Chicago’s treasurer, announced Wednesday that she’s ordering her office to boycott investing in U.S. Treasury securities — not as an investment strategy, but as a political protest against Donald Trump and what she called his “authoritarian regime.” This is the municipal finance version of an insurrection. Conyears-Ervin obviously hates Trump, which she is entitled to. But Trump doesn’t issue any Treasuries. Those are the debt of the U.S. government, backed by the full faith and credit of the American people. She’s not boycotting authoritarianism. She’s boycotting America. Here’s the thing: Chicago doesn’t currently hold any Treasury securities. The city held over $200 million in Treasuries within the past three years, but not now. So, she’s announcing a boycott of something the city isn’t doing. What is Chicago going to invest in if they will not buy America’s debt because their treasurer is mad at the man America elected president? Conyears-Ervin claims her office can safely earn comparable returns in alternatives like corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. In other words, to protest Trump’s misdeeds, she’s going long corporate America. American leftism is getting weirder and weirder. Oh, and guess what? She’s running for Congress. Because of course she is. The Founding Father of South America This Sunday, November 16, marks the 493rd anniversary of Spanish explorer Francisco Pizarro‘s encounter with the Inca Empire at Cajamarca—one of history’s most consequential collisions between civilizations. This triggered the Spanish colonization of most of South America, which in turn gave birth to the modern nation-states that exist today: Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Pizarro, in other words, is the founding father of South America. It’s the kind of historical milestone that used to warrant reflection on how the world changes, how power redistributes, how established orders crumble. These days, it’s the kind of anniversary polite society has decided not to celebrate. Have a good weekend. COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format Trump’s $2,000 Tariff-Funded Checks Spark Economic Debate Trump announced the idea on Truth Social, saying every eligible American would receive a “dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!)” funded by tariff revenues, as per a Newsweek report. The plan, however, has not been formally introduced as policy, and many questions remain about how it would work and whether it’s financially viable.Economists Warn Trump’s $2,000 Payments Could Fuel Inflation Several experts told Newsweek that Trump’s plan could push prices higher, as Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said, “Sending out checks to Americans is a recipe for higher inflation at a time when inflation is still stubbornly too high,” adding, “The president is pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, while he is also now pushing for higher spending—those two policies in combination would seriously threaten a return of higher inflation,” as quoted by Newsweek.ALSO READ: Big Short Michael Burry warns: Meta and Oracle may be hiding billions and fudging earnings by over 20% Economists Compare Trump’s Plan to Pandemic-Era Stimulus Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff agreed, saying the $2,000 payments would “of course” drive inflation up, similar to the effects of pandemic-era stimulus checks, as per the report. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed that such fiscal stimulus during COVID-19 increased annual inflation by about 2.6%, though it also helped avoid deeper economic trouble, reported Newsweek.Lessons From the 2021 American Rescue Plan on Inflation Risks Maurice Obstfeld, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said “The experience of the American Rescue Plan in 2021 shows that such rebates would be inflationary,” adding, “Already under pressure from higher prices of necessities, most households would spend rather than save the money, driving prices even higher,"" as quoted in the report.ALSO READ: Nvidia now worth more than Japan’s entire economy — just 30,000 employees vs 124 million people Can Tariff Revenues Really Fund Trump’s $2,000 Rebate Checks? Experts Doubt It Economists also questioned whether tariffs alone could pay for such large payments. The Treasury Department reported that customs duties brought in about $195 billion in the 2025 fiscal year, reported Newsweek.Obstfeld estimated that “Even if the $2,000 checks are awarded per household (not per person), and only to households earning less than $100,000 per year, the budgetary cost would be more than $200 billion,"" as quoted in the report. He added, “This sum is close to the revenue Trump’s tariffs will probably yield this year, and more than half of the cost of extending the Obamacare subsidies for 10 years,” and said, “The checks would contribute materially to a U.S. federal deficit that is already unsustainably large,” as quoted by Newsweek. FAQs What is Donald Trump’s $2,000 check proposal?It’s a plan to send $2,000 payments to lower- and middle-income Americans using money raised from tariffs. Who would qualify for Trump’s $2,000 checks? Trump said the payments would go to lower- and middle-income Americans, excluding high-income earners.

"American shoppers are expected to spend more during this holiday shopping season than last year despite economic uncertainty and rising prices. The 2025 forecast from the National Retail Federation on Thursday estimates that shoppers will collectively spend between $1.01 trillion and $1.02 trillion in November and December, an increase of 3.7% to 4.2% compared with last year. Retailers rung up $976 billion in holiday sales last year, the group said. “We’re seeing really positive behavior and engagement from consumers, ” NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay told reporters on a call Thursday. “In fairness, that’s been somewhat of a surprise.” But Shay said more Americans are growing selective and they’re focused on discounts. And while spending is expected to be up again, the growth of that spending may be in decline. That is still greater than the average increase of 3.6% between 2010 to 2019. Americans ramped up spending after that during the coronavirus pandemic. Holiday season sales rose 8.9% in 2020 and soared 12.5% in 2021, according to the NRF. The group’s holiday forecast is based on economic modeling using various key economic indicators including consumer spending, disposable personal income, employment, wages, inflation and previous monthly retail sales releases. NRF’s calculation excludes automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants to focus on core retail. Holiday spending accounts for 19% of annual sales for the retail industry, though for some retailers the number is a lot higher, according to the NRF. And consumer spending in the U.S. is monitored closely because it drives about 70% of the nation’s gross domestic product. The forecast this year, however, arrives during the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. There has been no government data released on the jobs market or retail sales since the shutdown began 37 days ago. “Forecasting is increasingly challenging in this environment,” Shay acknowledged. The NRF forecast is in line with other estimates, however, which point to slowing growth. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase last year. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31, compared with last year’s 4.2%. Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion this holiday season, representing 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year’s 8.7% growth. Consumer spending in the U.S. has remained resilient even as consumer confidence has eroded. Mark Matthews, NRF’s chief economist and executive director of research, said consumer behavior is changing with a sharper focus on finding deals. And the frequency of family nights out at a restaurant is on the decline, NRF executives said. The timing of the government shutdown is “absolutely problematic,” Matthews said, noting that it’s led to a loss in private sector income, which erodes consumer demand. Spending should recover once the shutdown ends, Matthews said, yet there are broader issues of concern that will not be solved when the government shutdown ends. The gap between wealthy and lower-income households is widening, according to analysts. Based on spending from its credit card and bank customers, Bank of America found that spending growth among lower income households rose 0.6% in September compared with the same period last year. Among higher income brackets, spending rose at more than four times that speed, or 2.6%, in September. And wages are growing faster for higher income households. That is making it more difficult for lower income households to keep up when tariffs and other economic factors are pushing prices higher. In a separate report this week, Bank of America estimated that U.S. consumers are bearing 50% to 70% of the U.S. tariff costs, and it expects that load to grow. “We think there is overwhelming evidence that tariffs have pushed inflation higher for consumers,’’ Bank of America economists Stephen Juneau and Aditya Bhave wrote. At the same time, U.S. companies have announced tens of thousands of job cuts. Some companies have cited rising operational costs from new tariffs under the Trump administration, as well as shifting consumer spending, corporate restructuring, or increased spending on artificial intelligence. That has led retailers to pull back on the hiring of seasonal workers.",right
"U.S. officials are privately saying that they might not levy long-promised semiconductor tariffs soon, potentially delaying a centerpiece of President Donald Trump's economic agenda. Officials relayed these messages over the last several days to stakeholders in government and private industry, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations. A fourth person following the matter also said the administration was taking a more cautious approach to avoid provoking China. The discussions have not been previously reported. Trump aides are taking their time on chip tariffs as they work to avoid a rupture with Beijing over trade issues, which would risk a return to a tit-for-tat trade war and disruption of the flow of critical rare earth minerals, according to two of the people. Those people cautioned that no decision is final until the administration signs off on it, and also said that triple-digit tariffs could be imposed at any time. The sources spoke anonymously in order to recount private conversations about policy deliberations. Trump said in August that the United States would impose a tariff of about 100% on imports of semiconductors but exempted companies that are manufacturing in the U.S. or have committed to do so. Privately, over the last several months, Washington officials had told people that the administration would roll out the tariffs soon. That guidance has now changed as the administration has continued to debate the timing and other details. A White House spokesman and a Commerce Department official, asked about the discussions, disputed that the administration had adjusted its posture. ""The Trump Administration remains committed to using every lever of executive power to reshore the manufacturing that's critical to our national and economic security,"" said the spokesman, Kush Desai. ""Any anonymously-sourced reports suggesting otherwise are simply Fake News."" The Commerce official said, ""There is no change in department policy regarding semiconductor 232 tariffs."" Neither specified how soon tariffs that have been threatened since the early days of the Trump administration would be finalized, nor did they offer any other details. The Chinese embassy in Washington said cooperation between the two countries on semiconductors is the best approach. ""We welcome the U.S. to work with China to implement the consensus reached at the Busan summit between the two heads of state, create a favorable environment for mutually beneficial cooperation between companies from both sides, and jointly maintain the stability of the global semiconductor supply chain,"" said the spokesperson, Liu Pengyu. TRUMP FACES PRESSURE ON CONSUMER PRICES Any decision by the administration to slow down or narrow the scope of chip tariffs would come at a sensitive time for Trump. The Republican president is facing growing consumer angst over prices heading into the holiday shopping season. Hiking taxes on imported semiconductors could raise consumer costs on the gadgets they power, from refrigerators to smartphones. Reuters reported in September that the Trump administration was looking at a plan that would also tax foreign electronic devices based on the number of chips in each one. Trump rolled back tariffs on more than 200 food products last week, but he has also said that his import taxes have made no significant contribution to inflation. The U.S. government shutdown has delayed recent data on consumer prices, but inflation has been running above the Federal Reserve's target since former President Joe Biden held office. Trump is also trying to maintain a delicate trade truce with China, a top manufacturer of both semiconductors and devices powered by them. Last month, Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, and reached an agreement to set aside their trade issues, for now. During those conversations in Korea, U.S. officials nonetheless warned their Chinese counterparts that they could take national security steps in the coming months that Beijing might find objectionable, according to two people familiar with those conversations. Trump has bet that tariffs can revive domestic factory jobs lost over decades to countries including China. In April, the Trump administration announced investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat.

"Costco Wholesale Corp. joined a fast-growing list of businesses suing the Trump administration to ensure eligibility for refunds if the US Supreme Court strikes down the president’s signature global tariffs policy. The nation’s biggest warehouse club chain is among dozens of companies to file lawsuits in a US trade court since late October challenging President Donald Trump’s use of an economic emergency powers law to impose the levies, according to court records. It’s one of the biggest corporate players to jump into a fight largely driven this year by small businesses and Democratic state officials. The Supreme Court heard arguments on Trump’s tariffs on Nov. 5. The justices put the fight on a fast-tracked schedule but didn’t say when they intend to rule. In the meantime, businesses of all sizes have brought cases pressing similar legal claims with the goal of avoiding uncertainty about their eligibility for refunds if the court rules against Trump. Read More: Tariff-Paying Firms Line Up in Court to Get Paid If Trump Loses Costco’s lawyers wrote that the complaint, filed on Nov. 28 in the US Court of International Trade, was prompted due to the uncertainty that refunds will be guaranteed for all businesses that have been paying duties if the Supreme Court declares the tariffs unlawful. The lawsuit doesn’t specify how much Trump’s tariffs have cost the company to date. Costco argues that it needs a court intervention immediately because Customs and Border Protection denied its request to extend the schedule for finalizing tariff determinations under Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The company says that could jeopardize its ability to seek full refunds in the future. Costco didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that, “The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump’s lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court’s speedy and proper resolution of this matter.” Skeptical Justices During arguments before the Supreme Court last month, key justices appeared skeptical of Trump’s tariffs, which have generated tens of billions of dollars a month. Lower federal courts ruled against the administration in a handful of lawsuits filed early on, but judges have allowed the government to enforce the tariffs until the Supreme Court issues its decision. Other household names to bring tariff lawsuits in recent weeks include cosmetics giant Revlon Consumer Products Corp. and motorcycle maker Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing Corp. The expansive, fast-changing tariff policies have disrupted the retail sector this year, threatening to raise prices of goods and hamper the purchasing power of US consumers who are already cautious following years of inflation. The impact has been more muted than expected due to exemptions and changes in rates after negotiations, though some items such as electronics and apparel are more expensive compared to a year ago. While retailers have warned that they continue to see higher costs, many big operators have not pursued lawsuits like Costco — making it an outlier. Read More: What’s at Stake as Trump’s Tariffs Face Supreme Court Costco has said it’s working to mitigate tariffs, which primarily affect its non-food items. It has rerouted some products to non-US markets, ordered more inventory early to get ahead of the levies and purchased from fewer suppliers by consolidating buying. When items get too expensive, it’s changing merchandising altogether. “We’re doing everything we can,” Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said in an interview with Bloomberg News earlier this year. “Whether that’s working with the suppliers to find efficiencies to offset the impact of tariffs, or whether it’s sourcing with them often to different countries.” For example, Costco said in May that it kept steady prices of pineapples and bananas imported from Central and South America because they are important items to customers. At the same time, it increased prices of flowers sourced from the region because they are less of a necessity to shoppers. The club chain said its big size and limited assortment — its stores carry a couple thousand items versus over 100,000 for some big-box retailers — give it a leg-up when navigating tariffs. Still, it’s difficult to predict what will happen to prices, company executives said. The case is Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Customs and Border Protection, 1:25-cv-316, US Court of International Trade.",right
"Good morning. Just three years ago, most companies treated generative AI like an uncertain curiosity. Today, it’s hard to find a Fortune 500 company that isn’t rethinking core processes to leverage it—momentum that’s only accelerating as 2026 approaches. Leaders are no longer debating whether generative AI will matter; they are racing to determine how to operationalize it. That shift was the topic of my conversation with Wharton marketing professor Stefano Puntoni, co-director of the Wharton Human-AI Research (WHAIR) initiative. Puntoni noted that generative AI adoption is progressing at an eye-opening pace. “I don’t think there’s any company that now says, ‘Generative AI isn’t for us,’” he said. The third annual WHAIR study, conducted with GBK Collective, underscores this acceleration, Puntoni told me. A survey of 800 senior leaders in finance, IT, HR, and other functions at U.S. companies with more than $50 million in annual revenue found that 88% expect to increase generative AI investment in the next year, and 62% expect budgets to rise by more than 10% within two to five years. This marks a sharp reversal from 2023, when concerns around data leakage, regulatory liability, and consumer protection—especially in heavily regulated industries—led many companies to ban generative AI outright, Puntoni explained. Today, most enterprises are moving ahead and figuring out optimal implementation with guardrails, he said. “I think it’s going to take a decade to really find out how to use this technology, but it’s improving so rapidly,” he added. Usage patterns show the shift. In 2023, only 37% of senior leaders used generative AI weekly. Now, 82% do, and 46% report daily use, according to the report. Because generative AI is a general-purpose technology, Puntoni and his colleagues expect usage to reach near-universal levels. “Half of senior leaders in a large sample of corporate America are saying that they’re using a tool every day; that is really quite incredible,” he said. Measuring progress Leaders appear optimistic about returns. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said their companies track ROI through metrics such as profitability, productivity, and throughput, according to the report. Four out of five expect positive returns within two to three years, with top executives more optimistic than mid-level managers. Still, progress varies by company size. Larger enterprises are seeing slower results as they manage complex integrations, while midsized and smaller firms report quicker progress. Tech, banking, and professional services firms are among the sectors making strides. The ROI reports rely on self-assessments rather than hard evidence, Puntoni said. Many organizations are still refining how they measure success, often focusing on intermediate metrics. “We should look at this data as more like a vibe of how they feel about it than hard evidence for what’s happening inside these companies,” he added. MIT’s August report found that, based on its dataset, most firms struggle to generate immediate ROI from generative AI—from a profitability perspective—with back-office automation delivering the biggest impact. However, both the MIT and WHAIR reports highlight a persistent barrier: workforce skill gaps. Wharton’s survey shows that 43% of leaders warn of “skill atrophy,” underscoring the need for better AI training programs. As generative AI matures in the enterprise, organizational readiness is paramount—leadership alignment, workforce skills, governance, and change management, not just technical capacity, according to the report. Enterprise AI is already a major focus on Wall Street, and investors are watching closely as big tech companies and their customers scale adoption. As we head into 2026, a clearer question is emerging: not whether generative AI will create value, but how companies can build the skills, systems, and governance to capture it.

"USTR Greer Talks Trade With Swiss as Swatch CEO Blasts Approach US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer held a video call with top Swiss officials following this week’s diplomatic mission to the White House from captains of Swiss industry, as the country looks to negotiate a reduction in the punishing 39% tariff the US has imposed on Switzerland. (Bloomberg) — US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer held a video call with top Swiss officials following this week’s diplomatic mission to the White House from captains of Swiss industry, as the country looks to negotiate a reduction in the punishing 39% tariff the US has imposed on Switzerland. Greer held the virtual meeting with his Swiss counterpart Helene Budliger Artieda and economy Minister Guy Parmelin, according to a Linkedin post by the Swiss government late on Friday. “Very constructive conversation with Ambassador Jamieson Greer on Trade and Investment,” the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs said in the post. “Great new dynamic in our bilateral relations, thanks to President Trump.” It features screenshots and photos of all three in discussion, and is followed by dozens of likes and messages of encouragement from Swiss executives. The virtual gathering follows the in-person meeting in the Oval Office earlier this week between the CEOs of top Swiss companies and President Donald Trump. Those present included Alfred Gantner, the founder of Partners Group Holding AG, Rolex SA boss Jean-Frederic Dufour, Daniel Jaeggi of commodity trader Mercuria Energy Group Ltd, Richemont SA Chairman Johann Rupert, Diego Aponte of shipping firm MSC and Marwan Shakarchi of MKS Pamp SA, a gold refiner. While Dufour and Rupert are both influential figures in the luxury goods industry, their rival Nick Hayek, the outspoken CEO of Swatch Group AG took a very different tack. “The only king I court is the customer,” Hayek told Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, perhaps in reference to the recent ‘No Kings’ protests against Trump’s presidency. Hayek, whose company is the world’s largest watchmaker, said the CEOs’ visit sent a signal of weakness. Instead, he suggested that Switzerland — the seventh-largest investor in the US — should retaliate by threatening to cut investment, or ditch a deal to buy US-made F-35 jets. “Are we William Tell,” he quipped in reference to the Swiss hero of folklore, “or are we a vassal?” Trump’s tariff announcement, delivered on Switzerland’s national holiday, landed Swiss exporters with a rate higher than any other developed nation. The levy, which took effect in August, threatens to drive up costs for chocolatiers including Lindt, watchmakers and precision-tool manufacturers. Budliger Artieda has made repeated trips to Washington in recent weeks in the hope of resolving the impasse. While demand for Swiss goods has, in some cases, withstood the impact of the tariffs, Bern has cut its growth forecast for next year, acknowledging the likelihood of economic damage.

"Trump administration says it has trade frameworks with Argentina, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said Thursday that it had reached trade frameworks with Argentina, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala. The frameworks are about increasing the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, according to a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity as a condition for briefing reporters on a call about the agreements. The White House also released statements on the frameworks, which have yet to be finalized and are expected to be signed within roughly two weeks. It’s all part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump to rewrite the rules of global commerce through the use of broad tariffs. President Javier Milei of Argentina hailed his country’s first bilateral trade framework with the U.S. in nearly a decade as “tremendous news.” “As you can see, we are strongly committed to making Argentina great again,” he said. The frameworks touch on an array of subjects, including efforts to reduce nontariff barriers and cut tariffs to 0% on American-made goods as well as commitments to not impose digital services taxes on U.S. companies. There would also be tariff relief on select products from these countries. For example, import licenses in these countries would be eliminated and streamlined, while nations would agree to resolve issues on intellectual property rights. Under the tariffs previously announced at the end of July by Trump, goods imported from Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemala are taxed at 10%, as the U.S. runs a trade surplus with each of those countries. Products from Ecuador, with which America runs a trade deficit, are taxed at 15%. Guatemala President Bernardo Arevalo called the framework “good news” and said his country would be in a position to attract new investments. He said that 70% of the products Guatemala exports to the U.S. will face zero tariffs under the framework, as exclusions are granted for goods the U.S. is unable to make. All other goods would still be subject to the 10% tariff. The U.S. senior administration official said that tariffs in these nations could be reduced on coffee, cocoa and bananas. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump have each suggested that the tariffs are being relaxed as affordability issues are a key concern for U.S. voters. ___ Perez D. reported from Guatemala City, Guatemala.

"US, South Korea Eye Joint Pact to Build Submarines for Both The US and South Korea are in private negotiations to jointly build nuclear-powered submarines for both navies, a potential major shift in their alliance that would go beyond the announcement made by the countries’ presidents two weeks ago, people familiar with the matter say. (Bloomberg) — The US and South Korea are in private negotiations to jointly build nuclear-powered submarines for both navies, a potential major shift in their alliance that would go beyond the announcement made by the countries’ presidents two weeks ago, people familiar with the matter say. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met in South Korea in late October and announced a pact to enable South Korea to build its own nuclear-powered submarines, with Trump saying they’d be built in Philadelphia. Since then, behind the scenes, a more sprawling vision has taken shape, the people said. A joint fact sheet on their overall trade, tariff and defense agreement published Thursday evening in Washington, and Friday morning in Seoul, touched on the building of nuclear submarines but gave no further details, an indication that many points remain unresolved. Officials from both countries are now considering a plan for Korean-led joint production, potentially across sites in both countries, of subs for both countries, according to the people. The scenario includes potentially beginning with US-class submarines, the designs for which are closely held secrets, before moving to South Korea’s own design, the people said. The talks stem in part from a private request of Trump’s own: When Korea sought the relevant permissions and nuclear capability to build its own subs, Trump privately said they should build a couple for the US, too, some of the people said. The US has been trying to speed up its submarine building. What form the deal will take remains deeply unclear, and talks could stall or collapse. The two sides are in early-stage negotiation over several core components, such as which subs will be built, where they’ll be built, for which country and in what sequence, the people said. In the fact sheet, the two sides celebrated joint efforts that “will increase the number of U.S. commercial ships and combat-ready U.S. military vessels as quickly as possible, including the potential construction of U.S. vessels in the ROK,” or Republic of Korea. It added: “The United States has given approval for the ROK to build nuclear-powered attack submarines. The United States will work closely with the ROK to advance requirements for this shipbuilding project, including avenues to source fuel.” The statement made no mention of Philadelphia. The statement stopped well short of detailing talks already underway. Any agreement between the US and South Korea would reshape the nations’ military alliance and could be similar to the Aukus deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. But the proposal is unprecedented in other ways, and would face significant questions, hurdles and headwinds to come to fruition. For the US president, the deal with Seoul is part of a grand bargain to lower certain tariff rates on Korean goods in exchange for a $350 billion investment fund that includes $150 billion in shipbuilding. Trump is angling to leverage Korean expertise in shipbuilding to revive the US sectors, from submarines to more mundane commercial vessels. “Having South Korea build submarines for the US Navy — based on a US or Korean design — would be unprecedented and carry significant risk,” said Adam Farrar, a Bloomberg Economics senior geoeconomics analyst for the Asia-Pacific. “Yet with US shipyards falling short of Navy needs, tapping allied shipbuilding expertise could help, if the towering legal, industrial and security hurdles can be cleared.” Earlier: US Races to Rebuild Submarine Power Before China Catches Up During a televised briefing on the fact sheet, Lee said Korea had continued to stand its ground in talks to finalize the overall trade and tariff pact since the Trump visit. “The US government maintained that the general framework had already been settled during the summit. But when it came to drafting the detailed text, they presented a wide range of differing opinions,” Lee said. “The lengthy process was unavoidable — it was the only way we could fully exercise the one power we had, which was to hold firm.” Still, the joint statement leaves several questions about the submarine plan swirling as talks continue. The Philly Shipyard, which is owned by Korean defense giant Hanwha, is not currently equipped to make nuclear-class submarines, though the company is preparing to build subs under any deal and has an internal target of producing 2-3 submarines within a decade, including potentially in Philadelphia, some of the people said. “Hanwha Philly Shipyard was a centerpiece yard in America’s storied naval shipbuilding past, and our commitment to it will chart the way toward America’s advanced shipbuilding future,” Hanwha Chief Strategy Officer Alex Wong said in a statement that did not directly touch on the US-South Korea talks. Trump is continuing to push for the US to receive two submarines and believes they should be provided for free, according to one of the people. Given that submarines can cost several billion dollars, it would be a steep ask. In a written statement on Thursday, Lee’s presidential office said that characterizing South Korea as pushing back against US demands or that the US had asked for two submarines for free was not a reflection of the state of discussions. South Korea has long sought nuclear-powered submarines and during his meeting with Trump, Lee asked Trump to provide fuel for them. South Korea says it needs low-enriched uranium — below 20% enrichment — from the US but, for that, the two nations would need to amend or find a way to reconcile their nuclear energy pact, which prohibits Seoul from using such fuel for military use. While Trump’s October announcement appeared to provide a green light for South Korea’s goal to possess nuclear submarines, Seoul wants to build them at home — and is seeking the technology to do so. The US is also looking to increase its own fleet, with construction of its foremost attack submarine, the Virginia-class, beset by cost overruns, delays, and labor shortages. The White House has declined to specify what class of submarine it wants built — leaving open the scenario that it might pressure the Koreans to build US-class subs like the Virginia class, at least in part, rather than their own design. But that goes against South Korea’s initial wishes for a smaller design. And the potential of that raises its own set of questions and potential controversies, including whether Virginia-class subs would be partially built in South Korea. The joint statement’s reference to “potential construction of U.S. vessels in the ROK” nodded to the possibility, though didn’t explicitly specify military vessels. “Even though Trump supposedly approved it, that doesn’t mean it will actually happen overnight,” said Kim Dong-yup, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies and retired South Korean Navy officer. “These things take years, even a decade to accomplish and there are countless legal and policy constraints in the US, including non-proliferation and secrecy restrictions. If Trump leaves office, it’s entirely possible that US agencies will step in and block the whole thing.” The White House declined comment other than to say in a statement, from spokeswoman Anna Kelly, that Trump is bolstering US maritime power “including by securing historic investments from the Republic of Korea to modernize and expand our shipbuilding capacity.” —With assistance from Alastair Gale.

"India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) on Tuesday raised India's GDP growth projection for the current fiscal to 7 per cent on the back of high growth in the June quarter and less impact of the US tariff hike on global growth and trade. Ind-Ra expects GDP in FY26 to grow 7 per cent year-on-year (YoY), 70 basis points higher than its earlier forecast of 6.3 per cent (projected in July 2025), the rating agency said in a statement. The RBI has projected India's GDP growth in the current fiscal year at 6.8 per cent, better than the 6.5 per cent expansion in the last fiscal year. India's real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at the fastest pace in five quarters at 7.8 per cent in the April to June period of FY26. The official data for Q2 (July-September) GDP growth estimates is scheduled to be released on November 28. Ind-Ra said both domestic and global landscapes have changed significantly since its last forecast in July 2025. Major headwinds are the uncertain global scenario due to the US unilateral tariff hikes for all countries, with the tariffs on India being one of the highest since the end of August 2025. The major tailwinds for the economy since the July forecast are faster-than-expected inflation decline, increasing the real wage rate, especially in rural areas and GST rationalisation, said Ind-Ra Chief Economist and Head Public Finance, Devendra Kumar Pant. The two major factors for the sharp upward revision in growth forecast are sharper-than-expected GDP growth in the June quarter and the impact of the US tariff hike on global growth and trade being lower than the estimated earlier. Ind-Ra, while forecasting the FY26 growth at 6.3 per cent in July, had assigned a key risk of tariff war and any capital outflow. Ind-Ra believes the risks to FY26 growth are evenly balanced. ""A faster Indo-US trade deal and favourable weather conditions during winter months have the potential to push GDP growth higher than 7 per cent. However, if the demand revival (consumption and investment) is weaker than expected, it could pull down GDP growth,"" the agency said. Ind-Ra expects private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) to grow 7.4 per cent YoY in FY26 (FY25: 7.2 per cent), driven by GST rationalisation and lower inflation. Ind-Ra said Indian exports to the US fell 11.9 per cent and 8.9 per cent YoY in September and October 2025, respectively. While exports averaged USD 7.2 billion per month in FY25, they averaged USD 7.4 billion from April to October 2025, but dropped to USD 5.9 billion during September-October 2025. ""Although exports to the US improved sequentially in October 2025, it is too early to call it a revival. A bilateral trade deal with the US and finding alternative markets for Indian exports would be essential for reviving Indian exports,"" Ind-Ra said.

"This is possibly a payout to every American straight from the money America will be raising from its tariffs. Such a proposal would likely need to be passed by Congress. This summer, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) introduced legislation to give $600 tariff rebates to nearly all Americans and their dependent children. Are you eligible for $2,000 tariff dividend? He wrote on Truth Social that a dividend of at least $2000 per person, excluding high income people, would be paid to everyone. It is pertinent to note that this is not the first time Trump has talked about the idea of tariff dividend.

He has just announced his intention on Truth Social and for this to become law, there must be a Bill which is passed in the House of Representatives and Senate. Notably, there is a government shutdown ongoing as well.Trump for the first time specified $2,000 as the proposed “tariff dividend.” Earlier, he had suggested that Americans might receive between $1,000 and $2,000. The administration has not yet explained how it plans to distribute the payments.

"The deal also includes a commitment by Swiss and Liechtenstein companies to invest $200 billion in the US, with $67 billion slated for 2026 alone, aiming to create thousands of American jobs and reduce the US trade deficit with Switzerland. The agreement, announced by US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer and Swiss officials, reflects the successful culmination of constructive negotiations to promote “Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade."" ALSO READ: Trump plots major tariff cuts to slash soaring grocery bills for millions of Americans Ambassador Greer highlighted the deal as a continuation of the ""America First Trade Policy"" that removes tariff and non-tariff barriers, expands market access for U.S. exports, and welcomes sizable Swiss investment into the US economy. Key features of the agreement include: - Reduction of US tariffs on Swiss and Liechtenstein goods to a maximum of 15%, aligning them with rates applied to the European Union, down from 39%, which had severely impacted Swiss exports. - Switzerland's commitment to removing tariffs on American industrial goods, while also opening up new duty-free quota systems for specific U.S. agricultural products such as beef, poultry, and bison. - Measures to simplify customs and labeling processes, making it easier for American goods like poultry, dairy, and medical devices to enter Swiss markets. - Robust agreements on intellectual property rights, digital trade principles including the avoidance of harmful digital services taxes, and enhanced cooperation on export controls, sanctions, and investment screening. - Swiss plans to invest $200 billion in the U.S. by 2028, with substantial new investments focused on pharmaceuticals, aerospace, and other key sectors. The US trade deficit with Switzerland and Liechtenstein stood at $38.3 billion in 2024, and this agreement is expected to pave the way for levelling that deficit by 2028 by fostering more balanced, reciprocal trade ties. This trade deal ends months of tariff tensions that began when the Trump administration imposed the 39% tariffs in 2025 as part of a broader strategy to address trade imbalances and alleged unfair trade practices by key partners. The agreement is seen as a mutually beneficial framework that strengthens economic ties, secures supply chain resilience, and supports job growth on both sides of the Atlantic through expanded market access and substantial new investments.

"U.S. manufacturing surveys released Monday showed welcome signs of easing inflationary pressures, with both major purchasing managers’ indexes reporting slower rates of price increases in October—a potentially encouraging signal for Federal Reserve policymakers as official government economic data remains unavailable due to the ongoing federal shutdown. The price moderation emerged as a rare point of agreement between two surveys that otherwise painted starkly different pictures of the manufacturing sector’s health. Inflation Cooling Despite Tariff Pressures The Institute for Supply Management’s Prices Paid Index fell to 58.0 in October from 61.9 in September, indicating input costs are still rising but at a significantly slower pace. Similarly, S&P Global reported that while input price inflation remained “historically elevated,” October marked the lowest rate since February. Both surveys attributed ongoing cost pressures primarily to tariffs, but the deceleration suggests some relief may be emerging in supply chains. With the federal government shutdown continuing, private sector surveys like the ISM and S&P Global PMI reports have taken on heightened significance for businesses, investors, and policymakers seeking real-time economic intelligence in the absence of official Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and other government data releases. Beyond the inflation picture, however, the two surveys diverged sharply on the overall state of U.S. manufacturing. The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7 from 49.1, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction (readings below 50 indicate declining activity). The index missed economist expectations of 49.3. “In October, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted at a faster rate, with contractions in production and inventories,” said Susan Spence, chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee. Production notably fell back into contraction after a brief improvement in September. Only two of the six largest manufacturing industries—food, beverage and tobacco products, and transportation equipment—expanded during the month. ISM reported that 58 percent of the manufacturing sector’s GDP contracted in October. The S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI registered 52.5, up from 52.0 in September, indicating a third consecutive month of expansion. The survey reported production increasing at a “solid pace” and new orders growing at their fastest rate in 20 months, driven primarily by domestic demand. New export orders declined in both surveys. S&P Global reported exports declined for a fourth consecutive month and to the greatest degree since July, with sales falling to key markets including Canada, China, Europe and Mexico. The survey explicitly attributed the decline to tariffs, stating “tariffs reportedly remained the primary driver behind the drop in exports.” S&P Global’s Chris Williamson noted that “tariff policies being increasingly blamed both on rising export losses and import supply chain disruptions.” Business confidence remained subdued in both surveys. S&P Global reported optimism falling to its lowest level since April, with “US trade policy uncertainties” cited as “a big factor in dampening business spirits.” ISM respondents also described challenges related to trade policy. “Business continues to remain difficult, as customers are canceling and reducing orders due to uncertainty in the global economic environment and regarding the ever-changing tariff landscape,” said one ISM respondent from the chemical products sector. The ISM report noted that tariffs and their impact on prices and demand “feature highly in respondents to the survey.” Both surveys showed weak labor market conditions in manufacturing, with ISM’s employment index at 46.0 (contraction) and S&P Global reporting only “modest” hiring growth for a third successive month. A closer examination of S&P Global’s survey reveals potential concerns beneath its expansion reading. The report documented an unprecedented surge in finished goods inventories—the steepest increase in over 18 years of survey history. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, called this “the most worrying” development in the report, noting it was “widely linked to weaker than anticipated sales to customers, especially in export markets, which could trigger a downshifting of production in the coming months unless demand revives.” Williamson added that “companies have also become less optimistic about the year ahead, with sentiment back down close to the gloomy levels seen around the April tariff announcements.” He noted particular weakness in consumer-focused industries: “Business confidence among producers of consumer goods is now down to its lowest for two years as firms growing increasingly worried about household spending in the US and falling sales to consumers in export markets.” This inventory buildup—where production exceeds sales—often presages future production cuts, potentially explaining why ISM’s data already shows production contracting. The Momentum Question ISM’s Spence noted that while there had been “a chain reaction of one-month index improvements” starting with new orders in August and flowing to production in September, “these short gains have not appeared to translate into sustained growth for the sector, a reflection of continuing economic uncertainty” The ISM data showed that October’s reading “corresponds to a change of plus 1.8 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis,” suggesting the manufacturing sector, while contracting, is not dragging down the broader economy, which requires a PMI reading below 42.3 to indicate overall economic contraction. The sharp divergence between the surveys reflects differences in sampling and methodology. S&P Global surveys approximately 600 manufacturing firms, while ISM polls over 400 companies. The different industry compositions, geographic distributions, and weighting methodologies may explain the conflicting signals. With inflationary pressures moderating but demand uncertainty persisting, manufacturers face a challenging environment navigating trade policy impacts, weakening exports, and economic uncertainty. The restoration of government economic data releases would provide additional clarity, but until then, these private surveys—despite their differences—offer the most timely glimpses into the manufacturing economy’s direction.

"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said New York City just shot itself in the foot by electing avowed democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani its next mayor, adding that the far left would have lost in both the Big Apple and New Jersey if an exodus wasn’t already under way. Fox News host Sean Hannity said at least 9% of New Yorkers plan to leave the city if Mamdani wins, adding that he personally hopes Mamdani loses — for the sake of friends who haven’t yet joined him in Florida after the city’s political decline. DeSantis suggested he will continue to welcome New Yorkers to Florida who want to keep any far-left politics back north. ""This is a guy, Mamdani, he wants to take down the Columbus statue. I have already said if they take that from Manhattan, we will take it in Florida,"" he said, adding he’d also accept the Statue of Liberty if it decided to leave and instead be erected in Lake Okeechobee. CUOMO CALLS NYC MAYORAL RIVAL 'DANGEROUS,' WARNS SOCIALISM WOULD BE 'DEATH KNELL' FOR CITY ""And I think it's an incredible act of ballistic podiatry, shooting yourself in the foot, by New York City voters. This is a guy who does embrace Marxist economics. He claims he's going to lower everyone's costs by having government-run grocery stores, and the only people that would think that would work are people who have never studied a lick of history,"" DeSantis said. Mamdani’s win was also followed by several fervent reactions from critics who noted that the socialist will be at the helm on the 25th anniversary of 9/11 – including Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., who posted a clip of a plane hitting the World Trade Center and writing, ""Wake up New York."" DeSantis said Mamdani appeared to only offer sympathy to an aunt who was on the subway and ""got dirty looks"" after the terror attacks. ""He never expressed the sympathy in that regard for all the people that got murdered. He's always embraced George Soros-style soft-on-crime policies. He hates the NYPD, if you look at his history. He is not going to stand up for law enforcement,"" the governor said. Soros’s son, Alexander, posted a photo captioned that he was proud to be a New Yorker after voting for Mamdani on Tuesday. ""The number one thing that moves people to want to flee these jurisdictions is the collapse of public safety,"" DeSantis added. SOCIALIST SHOCKWAVE: ZOHRAN MAMDANI STUNS NYC AS VOTERS HAND POWER TO DEMOCRATS’ FAR-LEFT FLANK ""And I think he's going to make the [Bill] de Blasio reign look like the Golden Age."" DeSantis noted that New Jersey GOP candidate Jack Ciattarelli came close to defeating Gov. Phil Murphy four years ago — but said countless Republican voters have since left the Garden State for Florida. ""First of all, we're not asking for anyone to move. People have talked about putting a tariff on people moving in at this point, because so many have done so. And I know a lot of people in Florida would think that that would be necessary, but here's just the truth: You look at all 49 other states since I've been governor, look at who's migrated to Florida,"" DeSantis said. FLORIDA MAYOR PREDICTS 'SUBSTANTIAL EXODUS' OF NYC BUSINESSES IF MAMDANI WINS ""[W]hen I got elected, we had 300,000 more registered Democrats in Florida. Today, we have 1.4 million more Republicans. Nobody has ever seen a change that profound."" Fox News Digital reached out to DeSantis’ office as well for further comment on the exodus. DeSantis also commented separately on Virginia voters selecting a man to be their top law enforcement officer who had envisioned the violent murder of a Republican leader and his children: ""That Virginia would elect a guy who wanted to see the children of his political opponents murdered — against a successful Republican incumbent — is a sign that the state is about to move strongly left,"" DeSantis said of Jay Jones’ win over incumbent Jason Miyares. In response to an X follower who asked where DeSantis would house refugees from New York City, the governor quipped: ""Southern Connecticut?""

"Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch voiced concern Wednesday about granting presidents unlimited authority, pressing lawyers to define limits on executive power as the high court heard arguments over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs. Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, questioned both the “major questions” and “nondelegation” doctrines while asking Solicitor General D. John Sauer to outline boundaries to the administration’s broad defense of its tariff powers. The conservative justice warned of “a one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people’s elected representatives” in Congress. Sauer acknowledged that under the same interpretation, a future president could declare climate change a national emergency and impose tariffs to address it — a scenario that appeared to underscore Gorsuch’s warning about unchecked executive authority. Read more: Uncommon Knowledge: Trump’s Tariffs Showdown at Supreme Court Has a Twist Why It Matters The Court heard oral arguments in two cases related to Trump’s ability to authorize tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) on Wednesday. IEEPA is a 1977 law that allows the president to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.” Trump cites IEEPA in executive orders related to reciprocal tariffs, which he states he has the authority to implement. The Supreme Court currently has a 6-3 conservative majority and has previously ruled in favor of the Trump administration on key issues such as immigration enforcement and cuts at federal government agencies. What To Know Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned Sauer about the limitations of the president’s power. “I want it explained to me how you draw the line, because you say we shouldn’t be concerned because this is foreign affairs and the president has inherent authority, and so delegation off the books, more or less. And if that’s true, what would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce, for that matter, declare war, to the president,” Gorsuch said. Sauer responded, “We don’t contend that he could do that.” Several other justices questioned Sauer's arguments, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett. In a brief, Sauer and other attorneys for the administration had argued that the verbiage of IEEPA is “capacious,” granting the president the authority to control a broad range of transactions. Barrett said to Sauer during oral arguments, “You’ve referred to the other verbs in IEEPA as capacious. Would you really describe them as capacious? Because to me, things like nullify and void have definite meanings. I agree with you that regulate is a broader term, but those words I think are powerful, they give, they pack a punch, but I wouldn’t describe them as capacious in the sense that they have a wide range of meanings.” What People Are Saying Justice Neil Gorsuch, during oral arguments: ""Don't we have a serious retrieval problem here? Because once Congress delegates by a bare majority and the president signs it, and of course, every president would sign a law that gives them more authority, Congress can't take that back without a supermajority. And even, you know, even then it's going to be veto-proof. What president is ever going to give that power back? Pretty rare president."" Solicitor General D. John Sauer, during oral arguments: ""I disagree because in January 2023, Congress voted to terminate one of the biggest IEEPA emergencies ever, the COVID emergency, and the president went along with that. So what the statute reflects is there's going to be the ability for a sort of political consensus against a declared emergency.""

"Tariff Dividend: U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday pledged to distribute a $2000 tariff dividend directly to most American citizens, asserting that the plan will be funded entirely through the nation’s booming tariff revenues. The announcement, made via Trump’s Truth Social account, comes as his trade policies face a critical legal test before the U.S. Supreme Court. In his Sunday morning post, President Trump said the United States is “taking in trillions of dollars” through tariffs and will “soon begin paying down our enormous $37 trillion debt.” He added that a dividend of at least $2000 per person, excluding high-income earners, would be paid directly to Americans. No other information about who will be eligible and when the payments will begin has been disclosed yet. The announcement comes amid heightened legal scrutiny of Trump’s tariff policies. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the scope of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), under which Trump justified his wide-ranging levies on imports from China and other nations. Lower courts have previously ruled that many of the tariffs exceeded executive authority. A final ruling from the nation’s highest court could determine whether the president can continue using tariffs as a unilateral fiscal instrument.
