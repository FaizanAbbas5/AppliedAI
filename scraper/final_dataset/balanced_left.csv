"Central Bank officials warned on Monday that there could be a knock-on effect to the Irish economy in the event of a stock market shock, as valuations of US technology stocks show signs of being “stretched”. A valuation model developed by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller puts stocks in the US S&P 500 index as trading at about 40 times earnings, adjusted for inflation – the second-highest level ever, trailing only the dot-com peak in 2000. Mark Cassidy, director of financial stability at the Central Bank, noted that the 10 largest US companies – including Amazon, Meta, Apple and Nvidia – have accounted for 45 per cent of gains of the wider S&P 500 since April, as the market has surged to all-time highs – despite high levels of macroeconomic uncertainty. Most of the tech groups have major operations and are significant employers in Ireland. Irish business grandee Gary McGann on working with Michael Smurfit, the fall of Anglo Irish and the current state of the Irish economy This week on Inside Business host Ciarán Hancock is joined in studio by Gary McGann, a grandee of Irish business whose many roles included being chief executive of drinks group Gilbeys, Aer Lingus and packaging group Smurfit. Born and raised in Dublin, Gary actually began his career in the civil service, with the Comptroller & Auditor General. He studied at night to become an accountant and later moved into the private sector, rising up the ranks and moving around to eventually become CEO of Smurfit in 2002.He has also had a busy career as a non-executive director, including roles with Anglo Irish Bank at the time of its collapse, and with bakery goods group Arytza, at a challenging time for that business. We covered a lot of ground in this interview. You’ll hear Gary talk about his childhood, his time in school and a couple of false starts in university. We also take a deep dive into his business careers, the highs and the lows. And he gives Ciarán his perspective on the current state of the Irish economy, and what we could be doing better. Along with some tips for young business leaders starting out in their careers. Produced by John Casey with JJ Vernon on sound. However, Cassidy said at the launch of the authority’s second financial stability review of the year that the domestic Irish economy faces greater direct exposure to international tariffs on trade. READ MORE “Both would impact directly upon Ireland. But it is a trade and FDI (foreign direct investment) shock, anything further in relation to tariffs, [that] would affect us most directly here,” Mr Cassidy said. “We are somewhat less exposed directly to financial market shocks, but inevitably they would also spill over.” The pricing of artificial intelligence-related (AI) stocks is reliant on ongoing favourable projections for earnings growth, the report said. A substantial shift in investor risk appetite, major negative developments in the business models of AI-related companies, or a series of correlated macroeconomic or financial shocks could lead to a significant market correction, it warned. The International Monetary Fund, Bank of England, and members of the European Central Bank governing council have warned in the past month about market valuation risks, while the heads of Wall Street beasts Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have predicted that equities could fall 10-20 per cent. The Central Bank report also warned that market interest rates attached to corporate bonds are also at multiyear lows, relative to low-risk sovereign bonds, and “appear disconnected from the uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment”. It noted that the bankruptcies in recent months of US car-loan specialist Tricolor Holdings and car-parts supplier First Brands Group are “warning signs” have led to heightened concerns over lending standards in the international private credit market. When asked about the potential impact on the European economy from US tariffs, Central Bank governor Gabriel Makhlouf indicated that he was more concerned about tariffs and trade barriers on the EU single market. A landmark report on EU competitiveness last year, written by former ECB president Mario Draghi, found that Europe’s existing internal barriers act as a de facto 44 per cent tariff on average goods and a 100 per cent tariff for services. “We should be spending less time worrying about tariffs from the United States and thinking more about the tariffs that are effectively imposed within the single market,” Mr Makhlouf said, adding that more time should be spent trying to dismantle the internal EU obstacles.",left
"Late in a player’s career, there comes a game that sharpens the focus like no other, where you exist in a bubble of “now”. For me, that moment arrived in November, 2013, while preparing to face New Zealand. I was running out of road. At 33, World Cup selection was far from guaranteed and Ireland were unlikely to cross paths with the All Blacks again unless we reached the final. It sharpened me in a way youth never could. Throughout my career, I had moments, largely outside of my control, that provided perspective and acted as a catalyst. I wrote recently about the power of feedback and mental resilience, which is something every young player should embrace. However, when your physical mortality as a player appears on the horizon, smart players recognise it and allow it to set them free, while the rest waste years worrying about the end. So, when I was handed media duty the week of the All Blacks Test, the normal polite nods and soft edges were gone. READ MORE I was clipped, focused and unwilling to waste time entertaining questions that did not matter. I was present in a way you only become when you know a window is closing. Mindset, when attuned to a task correctly, can be a very powerful driver for a player. Joe Schmidt was beginning to look for alternatives in the centre and had a young Robbie Henshaw on the bench. Luke Marshall was also emerging and had started against Australia. There was no future to protect – only the present, whatever that would entail. It can be empowering for those that embrace the challenge. Some do not, trying to deny time and cling to the idea that nothing has changed. Rugby drifts away from them before they realise what has slipped. I couldn’t help but think of that feeling as I watched Stuart McCloskey last weekend. McCloskey has lived his Test career in the shadow of three outstanding centres. Another time and place and he’d have accumulated 50 caps. Sometimes a player’s ceiling rests at provincial level, where club form never translates to the Test arena. On other occasions, access to the international pathway is blocked by high-grade talent. Are Ireland sliding down rugby's global pecking order? Every time McCloskey has been called upon, he has done well. However, I’ve always felt there was more needed from him at this level to displace the competition. This time felt different. He was selected on merit, plain and simple, even with a pride of Lions from which Farrell had to choose. The 33-year-old played with a hint of that late-career honesty and an edge, both physically and mentally. He had that willingness to carry, to take contact for the team, looking to free others with an offload. It looked like acceptance – and acceptance can be liberating. An untimely groin injury means he won’t play against Japan, but if he stays fit and maintains that abrasiveness, it will be hard to push him aside on his return. He gives Ireland something they need: a directness, a selflessness with an offloading threat that can provide a point of difference. This could yet be the richest chapter of his career. Ireland struggled to break down New Zealand. On the face of it, they were on par in possession and territory, but the All Blacks led the field in metres carried, post-contact carries and line breaks. The game is now asking players and teams for a little bit more imagination with the ball in hand and we didn’t find enough of it in attack. It wasn’t a collapse per se, but Ireland operate off thin margins to be successful, where the collective effort is supplemented by moments of individual brilliance: a Tadhg Beirne turnover, a masterclass from Jamison Gibson-Park, or a Dan Sheehan try, all built on a strong team platform. When we don’t have those individual high points, or the team basics are out of whack, the limitations within the Irish system are laid bare. Ireland went with a clear plan of how to win, a little rigid in approach perhaps, but for three quarters of the game it sufficed to give them a winning position, even managing to absorb Beirne’s red card. However, there was a tariff to play for a misfiring lineout, some poor punting and no line breaks. The crowd sensed it. Kicks that once felt like clever pressure began to feel like the surrendering of opportunity. With players like James Lowe, Jamie Osborne and McCloskey in the backline, you want to see moments where the ball is kept in hand and defenders are forced to make decisions. New Zealand may have built their game around structure for the last few years, but the current group are rediscovering that attacking instinct. The individual threats with ball in hand were clear. Leicester Fainga’anuku made a huge impact from the bench, responsible for the break that led to the Ardie Savea try. Beauden Barrett drew Garry Ringrose, his pass beautifully timed to open a gap for Damian McKenzie. New Zealand’s creativity and support play sliced and diced Ireland in that final quarter. There is a lesson there for Andy Farrell’s squad: find new faces to be creative or adopt a more adventurous approach from the collective. It has to be nuanced – not flinging passes for the sake of it, but moving the ball from the point of contact, everyone thinking about space and actively looking for it. Too often, Ireland were narrow in orientation. Even so, it’s far from gloom and doom. As my buddy Felipe Contepomi, head coach of Argentina, says: “If the decision is right, then we can work on the execution.” Think Crowley’s cross-kick, for example. The Japan match is an opportunity to respond to the naysayers. Eddie Jones will try to flood the defensive line and force Ireland to kick. The visitors will be a team with a plan. The Australian has caused Ireland problems in the past. McCloskey’s display against the All Blacks can inspire. He was selected on form and delivered. It puts everyone on notice and gives Farrell further latitude to trust his instincts when it comes to selection, albeit slightly limited by injury and also the Ireland XV match against Spain in Madrid. Tom Farrell might get a run against Japan. He’s earned a chance and it’s a reward for form. If not now, when? He could be the attacking catalyst for those around him. There needs to be a sense of adventure that translates from selection to the pitch. It’s time to back form over reputation.",left
"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said “no” when asked whether the U.S. was at risk of entering a recession in 2026, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” he’s confident Americans will feel economic relief next year stemming from President Donald Trump’s tariff agenda and trade deals. “I am very, very optimistic on 2026. We have set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy,” Bessent told moderator Kristen Welker. He also said, “We believe health care is going to come down,” adding that the Trump administration would have news on that front this week. The treasury secretary acknowledged that there is some pressure on the economy in certain sectors like housing, responding to comments from National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett earlier this month that “we’re starting to see pockets of the economy that look like they might be in a recession.” “Clearly, housing has been struggling, and interest rate-sensitive sectors have been in a recession,” Bessent said Sunday. He added that the recent government shutdown, which was the longest in history, also squeezed the economy. An NBC News poll earlier this month found that about two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living. Still, the treasury secretary pointed to the GOP’s landmark domestic policy package that Trump signed into law over the summer — the president’s “big, beautiful bill” — and to the Trump’s tariff and trade agenda as signs that 2026 will yield a stronger economy for Americans. “I am very confident about 2026, because what we are going to see is the president has done peace deals, tax deals and trade deals [and] the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill,’” Bessent said, adding that the various components of that legislation are “all kicking in.” In a separate interview on Fox, Hassett also predicted that ""it’s going to be an absolute blockbuster year ahead."" ""The good news for the next year is that the factories are going to be in place, and then people are going to start getting the jobs next to the machines and everything else. And so it really, really is a very, very promising set of data,"" he added. Also Sunday, the treasury secretary published an opinion piece in The Washington Post calling for an end to the Senate filibuster. “It’s time for Republicans to acknowledge that the filibuster no longer serves the country — and to be prepared to end it,” he wrote in the piece, later telling Welker that it was meant “to put the Senate on notice.” “The Democrats haven’t been able to stop President Trump in the courts. They haven’t been able to stop him in the media, so they had to harm the American people — 1.5% hit to GDP,” Bessent said, referencing the recent shutdown. “They don’t care. So I believe that Senate Democrats — if Senate Democrats close the government again, that Senate Republicans should immediately abrogate the filibuster.” Bessent also blasted several Democratic lawmakers who are former military and intelligence officers after they released a video telling current military and intelligence officers that they “must refuse” any illegal orders given by the Trump administration. “What I am confident of is that this was a display of gross, gross negligence,” he said, not answering a question about whether the Trump administration is issuing illegal orders. He added, “There is one commander in chief, and when you step outside of the chain of command and try to create the noise and chaos, that only helps our enemies.” He also spoke about the ongoing peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, voicing support for a 28-point peace deal backed by the U.S. that has drawn concern from Ukrainians, European leaders and a bipartisan group of senators who say the peace proposal favors Russia. “At the end of the day, it’s going to be a decision with the Ukrainians. President Trump is a president of peace,” Bessent said before blasting European leaders who are planning more sanctions on Russia. “The Europeans tell me, ‘Oh, we are doing our 19th sanctions package.’ In my mind ... if you’re going to do something 19 times, you failed,” the treasury secretary said, instead praising Trump’s economic sanctions package on India, which targeted Russian oil. He added that he has not spoken to the president about an alleged timeline for negotiating this peace proposal, including whether Trump is pushing for the deal to be signed by Thanksgiving.",left
"On Wednesday, a rumor began popping up in Washington about a momentous policy change: the White House, it was said, would issue an executive order on Friday that would finally preempt state AI laws, handing over those regulatory powers to the federal government. The minute it leaked online, lawyers and policymakers began to scour every sentence of it. There was a lot about it that seemed politically unfeasible; there was even more that seemed overbroad, possibly illegal. There were a lot of agencies that had suddenly been cut out. David Sacks tried to kill state AI laws — and it blew up in his face A leaked executive order draft reveals the tech billionaire making a power play to become America’s AI policy gatekeeper. A leaked executive order draft reveals the tech billionaire making a power play to become America’s AI policy gatekeeper. But crucially, they noticed how much power would have been handed to a certain South African tech-billionaire-turned-special-government-employee who’d tunneled his way into the West Wing — not Elon Musk, but the other one. In every section of the draft order, President Donald Trump was directing his cabinet secretaries and agency heads to imminently issue reports and guidance on how to punish states with AI laws, within the next 90 days. In the Attorney General’s case, they had 30 days to establish an entire legal task force to sue those states. Every single one of them would have to consult David Sacks, the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto — and one of the most influential tech venture capitalists in the world — while executing the order. “I don’t want to say it was a power grab. That’s too strong of a term,” said a tech policy adviser close to the White House. “But it’s definitely a consolidation, as it were, of his power.” The MAGA universe immediately exploded, with War Room host Steve Bannon — who’d managed to help kill a previous attempt at an AI moratorium in the Senate this year — dedicating part of his Friday show to the draft order. In Congress, Democrats revolted publicly; tech-skeptical Republicans were quietly preparing their statements. The AI policy world immediately issued reports illustrating how much power would have been sucked into the hands of the White House. The order had been scheduled to be signed on Friday — and then it never was. Outside the White House, the AI executive order, had it been signed, would have been legally unenforceable. But inside the White House, it would have been treated as an imperial mandate. Trump’s executive orders are historically designed to force his underlings to get his will done immediately, legality be damned, and the fallout tends to be irreversible by the time that the courts find his actions illegal. His tariff order, for instance, may soon be overturned by the Supreme Court, but not before causing trillions in economic losses and damaging the US’s international relationships. Asked for comment, the White House press office email run by Karoline Leavitt refused to comment on the record, instead only insistently asking us to name our sources. And from there, it would have been used as a threat against the states. “I suspect that if it’s effective, the most effective part of it will be having a chilling effect on state legislation,” Charlie Bullock, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Law and AI, told The Verge. One section of the draft would have allowed the government to pull any federal funding from states in violation of the order — not just rural broadband grants, which had been used as leverage in previous preemption fights, but anything from highway funds to education grants. “Even if [a state] can win a court case to make them give them that funding eventually, it would take a long time. States might be convinced by that.” As such, it would have turned Sacks into the US’s AI policy gatekeeper in one fell swoop. Though there are several White House officials with ties to the tech industry, Sacks, who has a provisional government employment status, is seen by Washington insiders as Trump’s closest conduit with the big-name tech CEOs, who consider him as a peer. (Though Vice President JD Vance did work in Silicon Valley prior to politics, he never did break into the three-comma club.) “He’s trying to maintain America’s competitive edge in the big picture, and you could say, in a more selfish manner, he’s trying to protect the tech industry [with] a more parochial, These are my people approach,” said the tech policy adviser close to the White House. But Sacks was also trying to neutralize a third, internal threat: the political forces within the executive branch, both on the progressive left and hard MAGA right, that were hell-bent on curbing his influence. Even in this hyperpartisan climate, the left and right share a common cause in regulating the excesses of Big Tech, and will even publicly join forces to oppose them. And it apparently takes place behind the scenes, too. As the tech policy adviser described it, the informal internal anti-Sacks alliance consisted of holdovers from the Democratic Biden administration “that were hyper-regulating and wanting to break up tech companies,” and the hard-right MAGA officials in his current administration “who don’t trust tech, and similarly want to regulate technology companies — either on the state level or on the federal level — and kneecap them.” According to those analyzing the bill, it was telling which entities had been completely shut out. The first move, spotted by tech policy experts, was identifying who’d been cut out. In 2023, President Joe Biden’s massive AI executive order empowered a broad swath of agencies to develop AI policy, and most — if not all of them — were suddenly absent. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), for instance, had been delegated to research AI risk management, evaluation, and standards development. (Those concerns, incidentally, were recently encoded in California’s AI safety law — a law that the AI industry has strenuously opposed.) Also missing: any mention of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), which centralizes the administration’s tech policies into one place before being brought to the President; the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the DHS agency that focuses on national security internet threats; or the Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI), the name of which speaks for itself. “Maybe in practice, David Sacks will be consulting them and the [Office of Legislative Affairs] might be communicating with them,” said Riki Parikh, the policy director for the bipartisan Alliance for Secure AI and a former lawyer for the Biden administration. “But it’s surprising to not list them out.” Instead, the proposed moratorium would have been carried out by four agencies: the Department of Justice, which would have sued the states in violation of the order; the Department of Commerce, which would analyze which states could lose their broadband funding; the Federal Trade Commission, which would have investigated which states would be engaged in “deceptive conduct” over ideological bias; and the Federal Communications Commission, which would have developed a federal AI reporting standard. All, naturally, would be advised by Sacks — and all of them now had power to pursue ways to punish states that wrote or enforced AI laws. Populist Republicans, particularly those in the MAGA base, immediately saw how much Sacks had influence throughout the entire order, and how much the order would threaten any state. Though they had briefly aligned with the tech right in getting Trump elected, Republicans increasingly turned on their allies over a complete ideological mismatch: they believe AI is a threat to conservative family values and will steal American jobs, are allergic to federal incursion into states’ sovereignty, and hold a general disdain for how quickly tech CEOs went from supporting Democrats to Trump. Several red states have begun writing their own AI regulations, and governors like Florida’s Ron DeSantis and Arkansas’ Sarah Huckabee Sanders have openly voiced their dissent against a moratorium. Even Trump’s open support of a moratorium hasn’t swayed the base. “Purely just from a political strategy standpoint, the base of the Republican Party is not with David Sacks and [fellow VC and Trump supporter] Marc Andreessen on this. They’re just not,” said Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime Republican strategist and the CEO for the bipartisan Alliance for Secure AI. ”And I don’t think they care because they’re just like, It doesn’t matter to us. We’re here to get what we want and there’s three years remaining in this administration. We were Harris and Biden and Hillary supporters, and then we became Trump supporters because it’s convenient.” Little did the AI world anticipate that MAGA would immediately try to kneecap them, even joining forces with the progressive anti-tech factions in government, and that their aggressive Silicon Valley approach via executive order would have further widened the rift. But it was enough for them to back off temporarily. The following week, a new rumor circulated Washington that the administration would sign an AI-related order, and they did — but for a completely different, non-preemption, very uncontroversial project directing the National Labs to engage more with AI development. The Special Advisor on AI and Crypto was mentioned only once. Update, November 25th: Added comment from the White House press office.",left
"What will happen to home prices in 2026? Here's what experts say buyers should know now. Homebuyers finally got some good news late this year when mortgage rates dropped considerably following the Federal Reserve's back-to-back rate cuts in September and October. With the Fed easing its stance on rates, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell into the low-6% range, a notable improvement from the 7%-plus rates homebuyers faced earlier this year. These lower borrowing costs are helping to reignite interest in the housing market, but the big question now is what happens next. Will improved affordability bring more buyers into the market and push home values higher? Could rising inventory finally give buyers the upper hand? Or will economic uncertainty keep things flat? As 2026 approaches, the direction of home prices is also up in the air, so we spoke with mortgage and real estate professionals to get their predictions about where home prices could head next year. Here's what they had to say. Find out how affordable the right mortgage loan options could be now. What will happen to home prices in 2026? Here's what experts say buyers should know now Steven Glick, director of mortgage sales at Ziffy, an all-in-one AI-powered real estate investment platform, expects flat to mildly positive home appreciation at somewhere between 0.5% and 2%. ""That band reflects two things moving in opposite directions: Rates have eased enough to coax demand back, but affordability is still stretched and supply is slowly rebuilding,"" Glick says. This outlook signals a return to normalcy after years of extremes, according to Debbie Calixto, sales manager at mortgage lender loanDepot. ""We expect moderate price growth in 2026 — likely below 4% on average across the country,"" Calixto says. Karen Mayfield, national head of originations at mortgage-as-a-benefit provider Multiply Mortgage, sees a similar pattern unfolding as lower rates bring buyers and sellers back into the market. However, Mayfield predicts pent-up demand will absorb new home supply. Learn more about the lowest mortgage rates you could qualify for in this market. What could happen in 2026 to cause home prices to rise? Several conditions could push home prices higher in 2026, experts say. Here's what could cause home prices to rise next year: - Mortgage rates drift below 6% and stay there. ""Each quarter-point matters for monthly payments and buyer qualifying power,"" says Glick. ""With the Fed already easing and signaling more to come, a gentle slide in mortgage rates would firm demand."" - The labor market holds steady. ""If employment is stable, more people will come off the fence and buy,"" says Joe Chung, a realtor with Coldwell Banker. When demand improves, prices tend to climb. - Construction costs rise. ""Tariff-driven cost increases will push new home prices higher, creating a floor for existing home values,"" Mayfield says. What could happen in 2026 to cause home prices to fall? On the flip side, experts say a few factors, including the following, could push home prices down next year: - Mortgage rates climb back up. ""An inflation surprise or wider risk premiums would lift the 10-year Treasury and, by extension, 30-year mortgages,"" Glick says. As affordability worsens, fewer buyers can qualify, weakening demand and putting downward pressure on prices. - Housing supply surges unexpectedly. According to Mayfield, a wave of baby boomers downsizing (meaning there are more homesellers) could flood the market with inventory faster than buyers can absorb it. - The economy weakens. Rising unemployment or a broader economic downturn would reduce buyer demand and purchasing power. Chung cautions that the market remains fragile. ""Small shifts tend to 'freak out' confidence, which can soften values nationally,"" Chung says. What could happen in 2026 to cause home prices to stay the same? The most probable path forward requires the following conditions to hold: - Mortgage rates and inventory move in tandem. Glick describes this as a ""push-pull balance,"" where improved affordability adds demand while growing supply adds choice, netting to flat-ish national prices. - Economic conditions stay predictable. Mayfield emphasizes the importance of stability. ""The key is absence of shocks — no rate spikes, no inventory floods and no major policy changes that dramatically alter buyer or seller behavior,"" Mayfield says. - Regional differences average out. Some Sun Belt and pandemic-boom metros continue digesting their 2021 to 2022 price surges. Meanwhile, supply-constrained Northeastern and Midwestern markets hold firm. ""Nationally, that averages out near zero to low-single-digit gains,"" Glick says. The bottom line Experts largely expect home prices to stay stable with modest growth in 2026, but that doesn't mean you should wait to buy. Glick advises locking in if the home and payment work today. ""Rates are already lower than they were earlier in 2025,"" Glick says. ""There's no guarantee 2026 gives you meaningfully lower rates, and even a small price rise or more bidding can offset a minor rate dip."" Calixto agrees, warning that new economic data or Fed policy changes can shift mortgage interest rates quickly. So if the numbers work for you now, it may be wise to move forward. Connect with a real estate agent who knows your target area and speak with several lenders to explore your options. They'll help you understand local market conditions and find a loan structure that fits your goals and timeline.",left
"Associated British Foods (ABF), the food and retail conglomerate the group that owns Penneys and Primark, is exploring a spin-off of its fashion chain and food business as part of a strategic review. The UK-listed group on Tuesday said it was reviewing ownership of both businesses in consultation with its majority shareholder, Wittington Investments, the holding company for the Weston family that has food and retail businesses in North America and Europe. ABF said it was committed to “maintaining majority ownership of both businesses”. Shares in the group, which has a market capitalisation of £16.3 billion (€18.5 billion), were down 2.6 per cent in early trading in London. George Weston, chief executive and third generation of the family shareholders, told the Financial Times that “the financial markets will better understand the food business if Primark were separated into a standalone listed business”. READ MORE “There’s a realistic chance of this happening,” he said. ABF has faced persistent scrutiny over the past decade about whether Primark — which sells T-shirts for £2.50 (€2.84) and jeans for £14 — fits into a portfolio that includes bioethanol, sugar beets, bread, Twinings tea and Tilda rice. [ Penneys owner Primark marks Middle East entry with Kuwait storeOpens in new window ] The company has historically argued that being a family-owned conglomerate helped insulate it from downturns and allowed it to plan for the long term. While Primark has been ABF’s standout business for a number of years, it has struggled in recent years as cash-strapped shoppers rein in spending. The rapid emergence of Shein and Temu, which ship cheap clothes directly from Chinese factories to consumers’ homes, has added to the chain’s challenges. Independent analyst Nick Bubb said “it would be ironic if after all these years ABF decides to separate off Primark just as its performance starts to be badly impacted” by competition from Shein and Temu. Tom O’Brien of Nephin Energy on the importance of gas, the potential of biomethane, and whether our energy bills will come down Mr Weston said any potential split of Primark from the business was “not in response to any trading issues”, adding that the question of Primark’s role within ABF had been regularly reviewed and last considered before the pandemic hit five years ago. The current strategic review had been going on for a “number of weeks”, Weston said, but stressed that a split was “not a done deal” and could take up to two years to complete. ABF’s food business spans groceries, ingredients and agricultural products, and Weston signalled he intended to continue as its head. Examining a split was about effective governance, rather than a need to change strategy, said Weston, adding that “it’s not about the short-term, it’s about the next 20 years”. Several analysts described ABF’s move as “surprise”. “The food businesses are not very well understood as the focus has always been on Primark, and Primark trades on a significant implied discount to other listed fashion retail peers,” said Anubhav Malhotra, an analyst at Panmure Liberum. “The separation of the businesses could help unlock some of this value.” ABF reported on Tuesday that Primark’s full-year revenues rose by 1 per cent to £9.5 billion and operating profits increased by 2 per cent to £1.12 billion. The chain has been steadily expanding in the US over a number of years and now has 33 stores in the country. At a group level, ABF reported a 1 per cent decline in revenues to £19.5 billion. Operating profit fell 23 per cent to £1.5 billion. Earlier this year, speculation about a Primark spin-off intensified after the abrupt departure of the fashion retailer’s long-serving chief executive Paul Marchant in the wake of a misconduct scandal in March. Primark is being run on an interim basis by former Marks and Spencer executive Eoin Tonge, who joined ABF as chief financial officer in 2022. Weston said the appointment of Marchant’s replacement would be influenced by whether ABF decided to split Primark from the group. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025",left
"Toymaker takes tariff fight to Supreme Court: ""I definitely want my money back"" Toymaker Rick Woldenberg made it his mission to challenge President Trump after he imposed sweeping tariffs earlier this year. Now, his fight has landed in the Supreme Court. Maurice DuBois reports.",left
"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs appear to be on shaky legal ground, with Supreme Court justices on Wednesday indicating he may not have the authority to impose them under a law designed for use during a national emergency. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority that has regularly backed Trump on various contentious cases since he took office in January, but based on the almost three-hour oral argument, the tariffs dispute could go the other way. Both conservative and liberal justices asked tough questions of Trump's lawyer, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, though some of the conservatives seemed more sympathetic to his arguments. The consequences are huge for Trump and the economy at large, with Americans increasingly anxious amid signs that the tariffs are contributing to, rather than alleviating, higher costs. A new NBC News poll found that 63% of registered voters believe Trump is failing to live up to expectations on the economy, after he ran on lowering prices, in part, through tariffs. Other recent polls show a majority of Americans oppose the tariffs, which disproportionately burden small businesses. The legal question is whether a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which allows the president to regulate imports when there is an emergency, extends to the power to impose global tariffs of unspecified duration and breadth. The Constitution states that the power to set tariffs is assigned to Congress. IEEPA, which does not specifically mention tariffs, says the president can ""regulate"" imports and exports when he deems there to be an emergency, which occurs when there is an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" to the nation. Until Trump began his second term in January, no president had ever used the law to tariff imports. Lower courts ruled against the Trump administration, with both sides asking the Supreme Court to issue a definitive ruling. During the argument, Chief Justice John Roberts, one of the court's conservatives, noted that “the imposition of taxes on Americans” has always “been the core power of Congress,"" a fact that was echoed by other justices in their questioning. “The statute doesn’t use the word tariff,” Roberts said. Or as liberal Justice Elena Kagan told Sauer: ""It has a lot of actions that can be taken under this statute. It just doesn't have the one you want."" The high-stakes case puts the spotlight on a court that was skeptical of President Joe Biden’s unilateral use of executive power, including his attempt to forgive billions of dollars in student loan debt. The court blocked that proposal, citing what has been called the “major questions doctrine.” Under that theory, embraced by the conservative majority in recent years, a president cannot impose a broad policy with huge impacts on society and the economy unless Congress passes a law that specifically allows for it. Several justices asked questions suggesting the case could be decided along similar lines. ""It seems it might be directly applicable,"" Roberts said, referring to the doctrine. Justice Neil Gorsuch, another conservative, probed whether it was unconstitutional for Congress to give the president sweeping powers over tariffs, as the government suggested. If the court were to rule for Trump, would there be any limit to Congress ""just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce, or for that matter, declare war?"" he asked Sauer. Gorsuch, appearing to reference efforts by Biden to tackle climate change, also wondered if a president could use the law to impose sweeping tariffs on gas-powered cars and other products that emit greenhouse gases. Sauer conceded that it is “very likely” a president could do that under his argument, adding that the current administration would never do such a thing based on Trump's view that climate change is a ""hoax."" Kagan and the court's two other liberals all pushed back on Sauer's arguments. ""You want to say tariffs are not taxes, but that's exactly what they are. They are generating money from American citizens,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said that when Congress enacted the IEEPA it was ""pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers,"" not expand them. Some of the other conservative justices were more sympathetic to Sauer's arguments, with both Justice Amy Coney Barrett and Justice Brett Kavanaugh questioning why IEEPA would allow for broad trade embargoes on other countries but not the less drastic option of tariffs. The law is intended to address an emergency, but if tariffs are not included, ""you're taking away the president's suite of tools,"" Kavanaugh said. Likewise, Barrett said that it would make sense for Congress to authorize ""weaker medicine than completely shutting down trade."" In questioning lawyers for the challengers, Roberts gave a crumb of hope to Trump by noting that while tariffs are a tax that is a core power of Congress to impose, they also relate to foreign policy, which the president has full authority over. Referencing the impact the tariffs have had in helping Trump make deals with other countries, Roberts said they are ""quite effective in achieving a particular objective."" Trump has made clear how important this case is to him and his economic plan, repeatedly warning of drastic consequences if the court strikes down his tariffs. He had even suggested he would go in person to Wednesday's oral arguments, becoming the first president to do so. He later backed off that idea, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick were both present. “If a President was not able to quickly and nimbly use the power of Tariffs, we would be defenseless, leading perhaps even to the ruination of our Nation,” Trump said in a characteristic Truth Social post Sunday. But even if he were to lose at the Supreme Court, Trump has levied other tariffs under different laws that would survive. And his administration has been looking at other ways of imposing tariffs, although those methods are more limited. The court is hearing the case on an expedited basis, meaning a ruling could be issued in short order. It has consolidated two underlying challenges brought by small businesses and a coalition of states. V.O.S. Selections Inc., a wine and spirits importer, Plastic Services and Products, a pipe and fittings company, and two companies that sell educational toys are among the businesses that sued. The challengers said in court papers that the justices do not even need to reach the ""major questions"" question, noting that the text of IEEPA does not grant any power to impose tariffs. They pointed out that other laws, including the Trade Act, specifically grant the president the authority to levy tariffs in some form. Even if Trump could, in theory, use IEEPA for tariffs, there is no emergency that would warrant invoking it now, they added. The cases concern two sets of tariffs. One is country-by-country or “reciprocal” tariffs, which range from 34% for China to a 10% baseline for the rest of the world. The other is a 25% tariff Trump imposed on some goods from Canada, China and Mexico for what the administration said was their failure to curb the flow of fentanyl. Other tariffs implemented using different legal authorities, such as 50% steel and aluminum tariffs on all other worldwide trading partners, are not at issue in the case before the court. As of the end of August, IEEPA tariffs had raised about $89 billion, according to the latest data available from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If the Supreme Court overturns those tariffs, the government would then face demands from businesses that it pay back that revenue.",left
"UK and US agree zero-tariff deal on pharmaceuticals Officials say the U.K. has sealed a deal securing a 0% tariff rate for all U.K. medicines exported to the U.S. for at least 3 years, in return for the U.K. spending more on new medicines LONDON -- The U.K. has sealed a deal securing a 0% tariff rate for all U.K. medicines exported to the U.S. for at least 3 years, officials said Monday, in return for the U.K. spending more on new medicines. Under the deal, announced by officials on both sides, the United States government agreed to exempt U.K.-origin pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical ingredients, and medical technology from import taxes. The Trump administration said that in return, U.K. drugs firms committed to invest more in the U.S. and create more jobs. As part of the deal, the U.K. government said it will invest around 25% more in new and effective treatments — the first major increase in such spending in over two decades. Both sides hailed the deal as a win. “This vital deal will ensure U.K. patients get the cutting-edge medicines they need sooner, and our world-leading UK firms keep developing the treatments that can change lives,” Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said. U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement “strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to U.S.–U.K. pharmaceutical trade.” Earlier this year President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer agreed on a framework for a trade pact that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products, including beef and ethanol.",left

"In today’s newsletter: An end to the shutdown could be in sight after senators clear a key vote for a deal. An Arctic blast leaves more than 105 million Americans under winter weather bulletins. And the Chargers dominated on “Sunday Night Football.” Here’s what to know today. Senators advance tentative deal to end the government shutdown Senators struck an agreement last night, projecting confidence that it will be sufficient to end the lengthy U.S. government shutdown, three sources with direct knowledge of the details told NBC News. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. The agreement, reached by a group of Democrats who teamed up with Republicans, cleared the first hurdle on a vote of 60-40 to advance in a late-night Senate vote. If it’s approved, it would then need to pass the House and gain President Donald Trump’s signature to become law and reopen the government. Even if it has enough support to clear those hurdles, the process is expected to take days. The deal funds the government through Jan. 30, would fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and reverses attempted layoffs of federal workers. But in a major concession from Democrats, it does not include an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Meanwhile, a group of Senate Democrats is pushing for an investigation into the Trump administration’s use of federal agency websites and emails to post partisan messages blaming Democrats and the “radical left” for the shutdown. In a letter obtained by NBC News, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others ask the Government Accountability Office to open a probe into whether the political messages violated federal laws that pertain to ethics and partisan political activity. More shutdown news: - In a reversal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said that states that issued full November SNAP benefits to recipients following a lower court decision should “immediately undo” the distributions and that failure to comply could result in the cancellation of future federal funds. - Thousands of flights were delayed and canceled over the weekend, as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that many will not be able to spend Thanksgiving with their families. - Trump floated directly paying Americans for their health care costs and giving out $2,000 dividends from tariff revenue, ideas that administration officials later said were not formal proposals being sent to the Senate. Arctic blast to bring frigid temperatures to most of the U.S. An Arctic blast dumping snow on the Midwest is expected to eventually cover two-thirds of the nation and bring record cold to the South. The blast broke off from the polar vortex above Canada, sending the cold air south. A list of National Weather Service bulletins shows more than 105 million people are the subject of advisories, watches and warnings on freezing conditions, winter weather and lake effect snow. The cold sweep is forecast to spread across the eastern two-thirds of the nation, and it could bring freezing temperatures to much of the South by Tuesday while setting low temperature records, the weather service said in last night’s national forecast discussion. Afternoon highs in parts of the South were expected to be 10 to 25 degrees below normal. Chargers defeat Steelers 25-10 on 'Sunday Night Football' As AFC teams continue to make their cases for championship contention, the “Sunday Night Football” spotlight fell on the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Los Angeles Chargers. A 25-10 Chargers victory has kept them in the conversation. Meanwhile, questions remain about the Steelers’ offense, and their own readiness to compete with the conference’s best teams. An expected quarterback duel didn’t materialize: Los Angeles quarterback Justin Herbert threw for 220 yards and a score while Pittsburgh’s Aaron Rodgers struggled. The future Hall of Famer had just 161 yards passing with a touchdown and two interceptions. Chargers wideout Keenan Allen hit a new record, passing Hall of Fame tight end Antonio Gates for the most receptions in franchise history, with 956. The Chargers move to 7-3 while the Steelers drop to 5-4. We covered all the action here.

"Ireland’s economy is like a dog simultaneously barking and wagging its tail. The question is which end to believe. While the European Commission is forecasting the economy here will record “exceptional” growth of close to 11 per cent this year, the Central Bank is warning about the country’s unique exposure to a slowdown in global trade on the back of US tariffs. In its latest financial stability review, the regulator also warns about the possible spillover effects on Ireland if the US AI bubble bursts. Economic forecasts here, no matter how positive, always come with caveats, potential banana skins. Being a small, open economy has its occupational hazards. READ MORE This time the leprechaun in the national accounts is exports. They surged between January and May this year as pharmaceutival multinationals front-loaded exports into the US ahead of Donald Trump’s tariff announcement in April. [ Irish economy forecast to grow at eight times euro area averageOpens in new window ] Most of it related to exports by pharma giant Eli Lilly. The company produces the ingredients for its two blockbuster weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound in Ireland. Either way, this has created a bulge in our headline gross domestic product (GDP) metrics. The commission expects Irish GDP to expand by 10.7 per cent this year, eight times the growth it is forecasting for the euro zone as a whole. Irish business grandee Gary McGann on working with Michael Smurfit, the fall of Anglo Irish and the current state of the Irish economy But GDP has become progressively detached from the real economy here because of the tax planning activities of multinationals which use intellectual property assets to declare as much profit as they can in the State. According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ireland’s headline GDP was €562.8 billion last year, nearly 43 per cent bigger than the agency’s measure of modified measure of gross national income (GNI*) which was €321.1 billion. In other words, GDP overstates the size of the Irish economy by about 40 per cent. That 40 per cent disparity is why the real feel in the Irish economy differs so strikingly from the headline growth metrics that surround it. Throw in an aggravated housing crisis and a dysfunctional health service and Ireland’s turbo-charged economic performance can seem illusory. The Economist magazine left Ireland out of its recent country “rich list” – a league table of how GDP levels in different countries compare - because it claimed Ireland’s data was “polluted by tax arbitrage”. In its report, the European Commission notes that as the front-loading effect unwinds, growth here is expected to moderate to just 0.2 per cent in 2026, “reflecting a technical base effect from 2025 dynamics, before stabilising at 2.9 per cent in 2027″. That means we’ll swing from growing at eight times the rate of the euro zone to growing at a fraction of the euro zone rate, all which means precious little to the average worker here with our GDP numbers now mere statistical noise.",left
"Sony is announcing the A7 V, its first camera with a partially stacked sensor and various features borrowed from pricier Alpha models. It will be available body-only in late December for $2,899, and a kit including a new 28-70mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS II lens is coming in February. Sony’s new A7 V uses a partially stacked sensor so you can shoot silently The jack-of-all-trades camera maintains 33 megapixels while inheriting features from other models. The jack-of-all-trades camera maintains 33 megapixels while inheriting features from other models. The A7 V is one of Sony’s most versatile all-purpose full-frame cameras, for enthusiasts and pros not looking to spend nearly $7,000 on an A1 II. The new A7 retains a 33-megapixel sensor like the A7 IV before it, but with a partially stacked design like Nikon’s Z6 III. Thanks to this tech, the A7 V can be used full time with its electronic shutter for totally silent shooting and blackout-free 30fps continuous bursts. While the Nikon Z6 III, as great as it is, had some controversies over its partially stacked sensor’s reduced dynamic range, Sony claims the A7 V’s sensor has 16 stops of latitude. Other features of the A7 V include a new Bionz XR2 processor with a dedicated AI chip for tracking autofocus and subject detection (like the A7R V), a new tilt screen (also first introduced on the A7R V), improved five-axis image stabilization (rated up to 7.5 stops), up to one second of pre-capture in continuous burst shooting, and a speed boost button that allows on-the-fly faster shooting (borrowed from the A9 III). The A7 V’s OLED electronic viewfinder is the same 3.68-million dot resolution as its predecessor, but it now supports a faster 120fps, and the live view feed switches more quickly from the LCD when you put your eye to it. Sony also managed to squeeze a bit more life out of the new model using the same NP-FZ100 battery — rated for an estimated 630 shots using the EVF or 750 with the LCD (an increase of 110 and 170 over last gen). The A7 V is designed as a hybrid for both stills and video, and its video chops have a significant improvement over the A7 IV. The new model records in oversampled 7K resolution to yield 4K 60p full-frame video, fixing one of the A7 IV’s biggest issues and oversights. The last-gen model relied on a 1.5x crop for its 4K 60p footage, whereas the A7 V now crops only to hit a high-speed 4K 120p for slow-motion work. As someone who owned and used the A7 IV professionally for about two years (before selling it to upgrade to another model), the A7 V has much of what I wish that camera could do for me. I got to use one for a very brief period, and being able to shoot silently in most situations like my other cameras is incredibly helpful for shooting freely in a quiet environment — like a wedding ceremony. One of my biggest gripes with my A7 IV was the delay while waiting for the live view to switch from the LCD to the EVF. The split-second moment of temporary blindness wasn’t egregiously long, but the A7 V’s faster switching brings it closer to the super-speedy feel of the pro A1 and A9 III cameras. I’m spoiled, I know, but once you adjust to it you don’t want to go back to a slower response time every time you pull up your second body. The A7 V’s new screen and ergonomic improvements are also welcome changes. I still don’t love Sony’s grip feel, even though they’re my cameras of choice, but Sony makes the best articulating screens around, offering the best of both worlds for photo and video. Up until now, these excellent screens have been reserved for pricier models, and I’m excited for more people to have access to them. It’s easy for the Sony A7 V to seem like a bit of a ho-hum update, kind of like last year’s A1 II upgrade was for pros. But Sony did a nice job focusing on refining and improving all of the base A7’s bread-and-butter features. It’s a greatest hits album of many of Sony’s recent new features. It’s a shame this line keeps getting pricier, as it’s launching at $500 more than the A7 IV’s original price and $200 more than the IV’s current tariff-inflated price, but new sensor tech is costlier sensor tech. Sony was quick to innovate and iterate on its Alpha cameras for years, giving it a massive head start in the mirrorless world ahead of Canon, Nikon, and others. But it’s been feeling like that innovation has stalled a bit in recent models. Now that Sony has played all its latest cards across its current crop and given its A7 V samples of its latest tech, we’ll have to see if Sony’s next generation of cameras can make any of the big jumps forward like it’s been previously known for.

"Trump is 'committed' to $2,000 tariff dividend payments, White House says This comes after the treasury secretary appeared to cast doubt on payments. President Donald Trump remains ""committed"" to sending each American a $2,000 dividend check to be distributed from tariff revenue, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday. White House officials are exploring ways to execute the plan put forward by Trump in a social media post over the weekend, Leavitt added, but she did not provide details about specific options. ""The president made it clear he wants to make it happen,"" Leavitt told reporters at the White House. ""So his team of economic advisers are looking into it."" The firm stance from the White House comes days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared to cast doubt on Trump's proposal, saying the payout could merely refer to tax savings enshrined by Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill legislation. A tariff dividend may come ""in lots of forms,"" Bessent told ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, adding that he had not spoken with Trump about the proposal. ""It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility on auto loans. Those are substantial deductions that are being financed in the tax bill,"" Bessent added. Some economists have questioned whether the dividend is achievable with available tariff funds. Trump announced the policy proposal in a brief message on social media on Sunday morning, focused on tariff-related tax revenue. ""People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k's are Highest EVER,"" the president wrote. ""A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone."" The message did not specify who would qualify for the payout or how the policy would operate. Two pandemic-era stimulus checks authorized by Trump were made available to individuals bringing in as much as $75,000 per year and couples earning up to $150,000. Beyond those benchmarks, higher earners were eligible for smaller payments. If Trump were to make the dividend payments available to anyone earning $100,000 or less, the policy would reach about 150 million Americans, amounting to roughly $300 billion in dividends, Erica York, a policy expert at the Tax Foundation, said in a post on X. As of Sept. 30, the federal government had generated $195 billion in tariff-related revenue, according to the Treasury Department. By that math, the estimated $300 billion cost of the dividend check proposal would far exceed the amount of currently available tariff revenue. In theory, however, the Trump administration could promise to pay the dividend from anticipated tariff revenue. The Treasury Department has forecast $3 trillion in tariff revenue over the next decade. Should the Trump administration choose that route, the dividend payments would add to the federal debt, which currently stands at over $38 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",left
"CEO challenging Trump at Supreme Court could trigger wave of tariff refunds: ""I definitely want my money back"" Rick Woldenberg says it's not in his nature, nor consistent with the mission of his Chicago-area toy business, to sit quietly in the face of an existential threat. So last April, a few weeks after the Trump administration unveiled sweeping tariffs on so-called ""Liberation Day,"" he took action. Woldenberg sued President Trump and his top advisers, alleging in a 37-page complaint Mr. Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs amounted to an illegal ""Executive Branch power grab."" After a lower court sided with Woldenberg in June, the Trump administration appealed, and on Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard the case to decide the fate of the president's signature economic policy. ""I just wasn't willing to be led to a slaughter by the politicians,"" Woldenberg told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Maurice DuBois. ""So we did what we're allowed to do, which is to push back."" Woldenberg heads Learning Resources, which manufactures most of its 2,000 educational toys in Asia. He has taken a path that stands in stark contrast to many top business leaders who grouse privately about the uncertainty wrought by Mr. Trump's tariffs but stay quiet in public or try to lobby the president behind closed doors. ""I'm not a politician and this is not a political movement,"" Woldenberg said. ""This is a lawsuit over the interpretation of a law."" The Supreme Court is being asked to weigh in on whether the president has the legal authority to levy tariffs on a foreign country in order to address a national emergency, such as the fentanyl crisis, illegal migration, or persistent trade deficits, all of which Mr. Trump has cited. Should the Court uphold his tariffs, Mr. Trump has said the decision would guarantee American prosperity. If Woldenberg prevails, the White House claims economic catastrophe would follow because the administration might be forced to pay back billions to American companies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month the U.S. would have to refund about half of the more than $200 million in tariff revenue collected this year. Woldenberg estimates a third of his 500 employees have had to shift their roles to focus on tariffs. Learning Resources has paid between $5 million and $10 million in tariffs this year so far. ""I definitely want my money back,"" he said. ""The government has chosen to hit us with a massive tax."" For years, Woldenberg has fought government attempts to infringe on his business. In 2009, he fought the Obama administration on tougher lead-testing rules in toys. And while he donated $7,000 to the Kamala Harris campaign in the 2024 election, Woldenberg insists his decision to sue the president isn't political. He has previously given to both Democrats and Republicans. On a recent Friday morning, workers at the company's 356,000-square-foot warehouse, north of Chicago, were preparing and loading shipments bound for big box retailers like WalMart and mom-and-pop toy stores nationwide. Woldenberg says factories in China and Vietnam have unique advantages: labor to assemble items like the company's ever-popular toddler cash register and source materials for products like ""BubblePlush,"" a new children's yoga ball that he expects to do well this Christmas. He said shifting production to the U.S. would be impossible. ""We can't do it,"" said Woldenberg, who took over in 1998 the business his family has run for decades. ""And we don't see our competitors doing it."" What they have done is play ""whack-a-mole,"" reacting to almost daily swings in the tariff rate. For example, after Mr. Trump took aim at China, raising the tariff rate to 145%, Learning Resources shifted some production to India. But then in August, the president raised India's tariff rate to 50%, and Woldenberg raced to ship those products to the U.S to avoid additional penalties. ""It was like a bat-outta-hell emergency,"" he said. ""And we had until Sept. 16 to clear customs in this country and the boat sauntered in six hours late. So, that cost us 50 grand."" Along with Woldenberg's case, the Supreme Court heard a similar case brought by five other small businesses and a group of Democratic state attorneys general. In that case, a federal appeals court ruled many of the president's tariffs are illegal. The case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of the most consequential of Mr. Trump's second-term policies. The high court has weighed in on an interim emergency basis on challenges to many of the president's initiatives, most recently in his bid to fire Federal Reserve commissioner Lisa Cook. Woldenberg said he's confident the Court will grant him relief. ""We and the hundreds of thousands of other similarly situated businesses will get the unlawfully collected taxes rebated to us,"" he said.",left
"Trump on rising NIL bidding wars: 'These colleges are all going to go out of business' ESPN's ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Nov. 11 was being filmed live from the Marines depot at Parris Island, S.C. on Veterans Day. So the Commander-in-Chief called. President Donald Trump joined the program and touched on a number of topics, including college sports. He was asked whether he felt former Alabama coach Nick Saban would be a choice to fix college sports. “Well I know him, and I got to know him because he brought his team to the White House,"" Trump said. ""He won a lot, and I got to know him. He’s a fantastic guy, and you know he’s somebody they should really get involved in college sports in terms of making sure it all works out because what’s happening, it looks like it’s not working out too well. Colleges, for most of the people, a lot of the lesser sports are being totally terminated, you know that, it’s a shame. It was almost like a training ground for the Olympics, and a lot of those training grounds are being lost. ""And you know, Nick knows this stuff better than anybody. He’d be, and he’s really active in it. I think they ought to let Nick Saban take a good, strong look at it, and we all, I could tell you, from my standpoint, I’d listen to what Nick has to say. I know him well, and he’s a fantastic guy, and what a great coach.” Trump's vision for college football Trump's vision for college sports aligns more with a Democrat-sponsored Senate bill. The SAFE Act is a far-reaching bill that requires the Federal Trade Commission to oversee college sports. It is nearly the polar opposite of the Republican-sponsored SCORE bill in the House, which seeks antitrust exemptions from the federal government to make and enforce rules on NIL, player movement and eligibility. The SAFE Act also provides for the expansion of the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 to college sports, allowing conferences to pool media rights in an effort to increase revenue and provide funding for all sports. The SAFE Act ensures all sports will be paid for, and not eliminated due to a lack of funding. In a follow-up, McAfee asked the president about NIL and the big business of college sports and its sustainability. ""I think we all understand that the players deserve money, I think we all understand their value, but I think an actual market with guardrails would be something that would be really good,"" McAfee said. ""This could be something, along with stopping wars, and building in tariffs and $17 trillion, maybe just put that on your desk."" “Well it is a very serious problem because even football where they give quarterbacks $12 million, $13-$14 million… all of a sudden you’re going to be out of control,"" Trump said. ""And even rich colleges are going to go bust because you’re not going to be able to do this. And you know they had the old way, they gave scholarships, they did lots of good things, but there could be some form of payment. ""But when they start bidding up the costs, look the NFL and all the leagues have caps. You don’t really have that in college sports, and when the guard comes along that weighs 350 pounds and he’s phenomenal and they say it’s the difference between having a great team and a lousy team, they gave him $10 million, that’s going to start happening pretty soon. All of a sudden you’re going to have like NFL-type payrolls. I don’t care how rich the colleges are, you don’t make that much money, even the most successful. They’re not going to be able to do this. ""Bad things are going to happen unless we figure this out. That’s why a guy like Nick Saban, now I’ve worked with Nick, but a guy like Nick Saban and some others getting together because they’re going to have to do something. Colleges can’t afford it. And what they’re doing, I don’t want to use any particular sport because it’s degrading, but they are really terminating a lot of sports, you know, sports you would call them lesser sports. But big sports, good sports. Sports where there have tremendous interest, they’re getting rid of them, and frankly the college football is very big, but as big as it is, if they don’t do some very powerful caps, these colleges are all going to go out of business, no matter how rich they are.”",left

"Delays, smaller payments: How SNAP funding will work The White House said it would give partial payments to 42 million recipients. The Trump administration said Monday it would provide partial payments to about 42 million food stamp recipients in November, though the White House warned the funds could take as long as months to reach households. The move promised some eventual relief as the government shutdown nears a record for the longest impasse in the nation’s history. The Trump administration, however, declined to use alternate funding that would have enabled the delivery of full SNAP benefits this month. The move to partially fund SNAP could delay benefits as states calculate and distribute the food subsidies, and the smaller payment may only grant recipients days or weeks before they face the threat of going without food anew, experts told ABC News. “The stress that families are facing throughout the country is tremendous, not knowing how they’re going to feed their families,” Colleen Heflin, a professor of public administration and international affairs at Syracuse University, told ABC News. Here’s what to know about SNAP funding. Is the Trump administration planning to provide SNAP benefits during the government shutdown? Yes, the Trump administration said it plans to expend partial funds for food stamp recipients in November. The emergency funding for SNAP will cover “50% of eligible households’ current allotments,” the Justice Department said in a court filing on Monday. The DOJ lawyers agreed to spend $4.65 billion on SNAP, which amounts to about half of the estimated $8 billion cost to fund SNAP in November. In the court filing, the Justice Department vowed to spend money available in a contingency fund for SNAP, giving individual states the opportunity to ""calculate the benefits available for each eligible household."" The disclosure came after a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funds to pay for SNAP amid an ongoing government shutdown. Will SNAP benefits be delayed? Some SNAP recipients were due to receive funds in the first few days of November, meaning their benefits have already been delayed. The logistical challenge posed by a partial delivery of benefits is expected to delay payments further, though the timeline will likely vary from state to state, experts told ABC News. Using emergency funds to pay for reduced SNAP benefits could take ""a few weeks to up to several months,"" a top U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) official told a federal judge in a sworn court filing on Monday. Since food stamps are administered at the state level, the USDA is expected to provide instructions to state agencies, which will then calculate the level of partial benefits for each recipient and provide those figures to be loaded onto the electronic cards used by families, Tracy Roof, a professor of political science at the University of Rhode Island who studies the food stamp program, told ABC News. ""The daunting part is that states have to go in and make this adjustment to their payment amounts,"" Roof said, estimating the operational hurdle could range from several days to more than a week after a federal directive, depending on the state. How will SNAP benefits be funded during the government shutdown? The Trump administration on Monday committed to spend SNAP funds available in an emergency account meant to aid families in the event of an interruption of the program. That reserve of contingency funds carries a total of about $6 billion, according to the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, putting the account well short of the $8 billion necessary to fully fund SNAP in November. The Trump administration said it would tap $4.65 billion in funds. The Trump administration opted against drawing upon a larger pot of money set aside for child nutrition programs by the Department of Agriculture. This alternate fund holds about $30 billion, far exceeding roughly $3 billion per month needed to fund the relevant child nutrition payments, David Super, a law professor at Georgetown University, told ABC News. The pot of money has built sizable reserves due to annual surpluses and an arrangement for the fund to share in a portion of tariff revenue, Super added. ""The Trump administration could transfer enough money over to SNAP to pay for full benefits in November without any conceivable risk to child nutrition,"" Super said, adding that the fund could likely also support full benefits in December ""without breaking a sweat."" How long will partial SNAP funding hold over families? The partial SNAP funding will amount to roughly half of a family’s typical monthly benefit, though the exact total could vary depending on the state and characteristics of a given beneficiary, experts said. Those partial benefits are expected to last recipients about two weeks, some experts said, noting the program could hold over families in the event of a speedy resolution of the government shutdown. ""But it’s certainly a lot of anxiety because people won’t know when they might expect to get the rest of the money,"" Roof said. Most states provide SNAP benefits on a staggered basis, meaning a portion of the recipients gain access at the outset of the month while others follow over the ensuing days or weeks. In turn, some recipients likely still retain benefits from October while others could be forced to go without funds during the current delay, the experts added. Could states make up for the loss of federal SNAP funding? Experts cast doubt on the capacity for state governments or philanthropic organizations to make up for the full shortfall in SNAP benefits. But some states, such as Virginia, have vowed to provide a comparable subsidy. ""States may legally be allowed to make up the lost funds but they haven’t been given a guarantee it will be reimbursed to them even after the government reopens,"" Parke Wilde, a food economist at Tufts University, told ABC News. Super, of Georgetown, noted that the financial burden of the food stamp payments would be significant for state governments. ""Fiscally, it’s a lot of money and I think the states would find it difficult to do,"" Super said. ""And operationally, there would be various steps that would need to be taken to make that happen, which some states are probably set up to do better than others.""",left
"This holiday season, tariffs are threatening the survival of a small Christmas supply business outside of Salt Lake City. Jared and Dawnita Hendricks have owned Village Lighting for 23 years, selling and distributing a variety of Christmas products to big box stores and directly to consumers online. The company currently employs 15 people. But when Village Lighting's 2025 holiday season garlands, wreaths, lights and decor arrived by ship at U.S. ports from Asia in recent months, many of them carried additional tariff costs of up to 50% per item. These added fees are the result of President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, which has raised U.S. import duties to levels not seen in over a century. The Trump administration claims tariffs will boost the U.S. economy in part by forcing manufacturers to move operations to the United States, and further by forcing U.S. trade partners to make concessions. But these global economic forces feel very far away from West Valley City, Utah, where tariff costs at Village Lighting are outpacing the company's expected profit margins. “The tariff costs in and of themselves are not sustainable, and I don’t believe we can raise the cost enough to the consumers to be profitable,” Jared Hendricks told NBC News during an interview at his warehouse in Utah. It’s an issue plaguing the entire Christmas decor industry, which for decades has relied on goods imported from Asia. American small businesses importing holiday decor this year have already spent more than $400 million on tariff fees, according to an estimate from a coalition of small businesses called “We Pay the Tariffs,” which counts Village Lighting among its members. Compared to the roughly $26 million these same companies paid in tariffs last year, that's an increase of at least 1,438%. Across the United States, companies of all sizes have tried to time their overseas orders in the hopes of avoiding the worst tariff fees. But for Village Lighting, which orders inventory up to a year in advance, this wasn't an option. After enjoying one of the company's most successful years ever in 2024, the Hendrickses decided to order extra inventory this year, a process that began last December and was completed by February. So when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners in early April, it was too late for the Hendrickses to cut back their orders, which were already loaded on container ships by the time the tariffs took effect. In an effort to keep their prices as low as possible, the Hendrickses have opted to absorb the majority of the added tariff costs. So far, that has cost them nearly $750,000 and counting. Tariffs are withdrawn directly from the couple’s bank account 30 days after each product arrives at a U.S. port. Their goal is to keep any retail price hikes under 5% this Christmas season. But the only way to do that, said Jared, was by “leveraging everything,” including their home, with a line of credit. “We went from working towards a profit to working for tariffs,” said Jared. “It’s affected our home life, our health. It has been the most stressful, difficult, challenging year of 23 years of businesses that we ever had.” This isn't the first time Village Lighting has had to contend with abrupt changes to tariff rates. During the first Trump administration, average U.S. tariff rates on Chinese imports swelled to around 20%, up from a simple tariff rate of just 2.8% in 2015. The Hendrickses responded at the time by attempting to diversify their supply chain across several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, Cambodia and Malaysia. But these countries were all hit with high tariffs in early April of this year, swept up in Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs. At that point, said Jared, all his planning “went out the window.” Moving Village Lighting’s manufacturing operations to the United States would be nearly impossible, the Hendrickses say, because of the type of complex machinery and skilled labor that are required to make the Christmas goods they sell. “A dozen different factories go into one wreath or garland,” Jared said. “It’s not a matter of me opening up one factory. It’s a matter of me opening up two dozen factories and somehow providing a pathway to get raw materials.” He said that it was unlikely “that anyone in our situation could ever financially find a way to make that happen.” The Hendrickses are not alone in feeling the sting of tariffs this holiday season. Consumers are dealing with it, too. According to a recent survey from the National Retail Federation, 85% of shoppers expect to pay more this year because of tariffs. And they’re right — Lending Tree, an online lending marketplace, found that tariffs will cost the average American an additional $132 on their holiday expenses this year. Goldman Sachs estimates that consumers are picking up as much as 55% of overall tariff costs. The Hendrickses said they feel like small businesses are bearing the brunt of Trump’s tariff pains. “When there was Covid, it felt like the whole country was kind of in it together,” said Dawnita Hendricks. “This kind of feels like it’s just us against the failure of our business, because of something we cannot control.” That lack of control is clouding Village Lighting’s future. “After 23 years, you kind of start thinking about, What’s the second half of my life going to look like?” said Jared. “Are we going to be able to move to the next level so that we can retire and enjoy our grandchildren and whatever?” Tariffs, he said, “really just put a halt to that and made us question, ‘What’s next?’”",left
"You can’t say that Team Trump is in denial about the extent and the implications of the electoral rebuke its party received on November 4. All of a sudden, from the president on down, Republicans can’t stop talking about affordability. Donald Trump himself alternates between claiming he’s already pushed the cost of living way down and publicly mulling ways to convince Americans to feel better about their ability to make ends meet. Obviously Republicans need to improve the president’s sinking job-approval numbers in anticipation of high-stakes midterm elections. But more immediately, the GOP must decide how to deal with the health-insurance “cliff” it created by failing to extend Obamacare premium subsidies in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and then refusing Democratic demands to fix the problem in legislation reopening the government. Republicans clearly can’t bring themselves to just extend the subsidies, even with the concessions on their cost and eligibility that Democrats would almost certainly accept. The Senate vote they promised on the issue by December will likely fall short of any actual results, and House Republicans are signaling unmistakably that they have no stomach for anything that looks like a blessing of the hated legacy health-care program of the 44th president (which they are now calling the Unaffordable Care Act). Recognizing that Democrats won’t agree to any “Obamacare alternative,” the White House is making it known they are warming to the idea of a second budget reconciliation bill (the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was the first) that would include health care and other goodies as part of a midterm “affordability” agenda, as Politico reports: “We’re going to have the health care conversation. We’re going to put some legislation forward,” White House deputy chief of staff James Blair said Tuesday at a Bloomberg Government policy breakfast. He expressed interest in a bipartisan health plan but said that “if that path is foreclosed, there is the partisan path of reconciliation as well.” Such a move would allow Republicans to advance a health plan with a simple majority, a path they unsuccessfully attempted in Trump’s first term to repeal Obamacare but successfully used earlier this year on the megabill … If a reconciliation bill moves soon, Blair indicated that the administration would also want to include “probably the Trump tariff dividends and … interest in locking in tariffs.” That last sentence is important. The conventional wisdom is that you don’t move major controversial legislation in an election year. In addition, most Republicans remember that the 2017 reconciliation bill aimed at repealing and replacing Obamacare failed, while a later tax-cut bill succeeded. So if they’re going back to the well on “Trumpcare,” they’ll need some sweeteners, and the so-called tariff dividends, which are really just stimulus checks under another name, would fill the bill. The other strong possibility is that the administration and its allies will structure “Trumpcare 2.0” to look a lot like free money as well. The president himself has been hitting this angle at Truth Social: THE ONLY HEALTHCARE I WILL SUPPORT OR APPROVE IS SENDING THE MONEY DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PEOPLE, WITH NOTHING GOING TO THE BIG, FAT, RICH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHO HAVE MADE $TRILLIONS, AND RIPPED OFF AMERICA LONG ENOUGH. THE PEOPLE WILL BE ALLOWED TO NEGOTIATE AND BUY THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, INSURANCE. POWER TO THE PEOPLE! Congress, do not waste your time and energy on anything else. This is the only way to have great Healthcare in America!!! GET IT DONE, NOW. President DJT In reality, what he’s almost certainly talking about is the ancient Republican scheme of returning to the days before comprehensive health insurance was a thing and, instead of subsidizing insurance premiums, giving individuals some money to combine with their own savings to pay for all non-catastrophic health costs out of pocket. If you’re young and healthy, it could be a hell of a deal. If you’re older, sicker, or poorer, maybe not so much, particularly if the “new deal” on health care is paid for by cuts in safety-net programs like Medicaid (which was the case in the 2017 Trumpcare legislation). Although there are many devils in the details, what may make this approach attractive is the more money for you angle Trump is already promoting. If packaged in a bill that also provides “tariff dividends,” and perhaps more middle-class tax breaks like the ones used to dress up OBBBA, you could have purely partisan election-year legislation that addresses affordability concerns by literally giving cash to voters. Will that do anything to reduce inflation? No, and in fact, it could have the opposite effect. But it doesn’t even have to be enacted to serve as a vehicle for GOP midterm messaging, and even if it is, the economic and fiscal fallout would be mañana. It’s always possible Republicans will rethink this approach and compromise with Democrats to deal with the immediate Obamacare premium spike in a direct way and put off their dreams of undoing the Affordable Care Act until later. If they were really clever, they’d design an Obamacare subsidy extension that would expire if and when Trumpcare is a reality. But it’s unlikely they’ll be able to bring themselves to even a temporary compromise when the chimera of buying off the electorate while bypassing Obamacare seems possible.

"The US Department of Agriculture ordered states to stop issuing full food stamp benefits for November and to “immediately undo” any issuance of the full allotments, after a Supreme Court justice on Friday paused a lower court order requiring the agency to pay Americans their full assistance. In the Saturday directive, obtained by CNN, the USDA told states to instead proceed with issuing partial benefits — which will provide 65% of the maximum allotments for November — as ordered by the same lower court judge earlier in the week. (Many recipients will receive less than 65% of their usual assistance because of the way food stamp benefits are calculated.) “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.” States that fail to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over issuances of benefits, the memo said. This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly 1 in 8 Americans who depend on the nation’s larger anti-hunger program. Over the past week, the USDA has issued guidance multiple times as lawsuits over the agency’s decision not to tap into a contingency fund to pay November benefits have worked their way through federal courts. The latest guidance follows a memorandum from the department on Friday saying it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal lower court order, and that the process should be completed later that day. Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in coming days. Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Friday that residents who should have already gotten their SNAP benefits this month will start getting their full payments on Friday. The next day, a Shapiro spokesperson told CNN that residents who received their benefits are able to spend them, but the state has paused issuing full allocations to additional people. Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that there’s “no clarity at all” in the guidance and that the administration is causing “intentional chaos.” “Once we decided to step up and say we are going to make sure that our people are going to be OK … we’ve now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money,” Moore said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Legal battles Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday evening temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to cover full food stamp benefits, siding with the administration on a short-term basis in a legal fight that has quickly become a defining confrontation of the government shutdown. The ruling meant the USDA does not have to immediately honor a lower court order that required it to transfer $4 billion to the key food assistance program. Jackson’s ruling followed one a day earlier by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island that directed the agency to make the full payments, reversing his own order from earlier in the month requiring the USDA to tap into its $5.3 billion contingency fund to pay at least partial benefits for the month. His more expansive ruling mandated the agency shift tariff revenue meant for child nutrition programs to pay full SNAP benefits for November. The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in appropriations for the government. The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling in recent weeks that the agency must at least pay partial benefits or, at its discretion, provide recipients with their full allotments. The agency opted to provide partial payments — first saying states could issue 50% of the maximum benefit and then revising the figure to 65%. But the USDA warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. The plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case raced back to McConnell last week to argue that he should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly. McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month. Providing full benefits Wisconsin immediately filed for 100% of its residents’ benefits to be placed on their electronic benefit transfer cards, according to the Department of Justice’s filing to the Supreme Court. But the USDA rejected the request because it had not yet had time to comply with McConnell’s order. That resulted in the state overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million. Responding to the USDA’s demand that states should undo any steps taken to issue full benefits, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said on Sunday, “No.” The state loaded November benefits onto the cards of nearly 700,000 residents on Friday prior to the Supreme Court’s pause, he said in a statement. “We are eager for the court to resolve this issue by directing the Trump Administration to comply with court orders and provide the certainty to the many Wisconsin families and businesses who rely on FoodShare,” he said. Similarly, Kansas issued full benefits worth nearly $32 million to approximately 86,000 households in the state, the filing said. These actions have hurt states that did not move quickly to issue benefits, according to the DOJ. They will be unable to receive funding to provide partial payments to their residents under McConnell’s prior order. Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly reacted to the Supreme Court’s action in a statement Friday night, saying, “In accordance with a court’s order and after receiving guidance from the USDA, Kansas sent full November SNAP benefits to all eligible Kansans. These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates.” North Carolina, which issued partial benefits to more than 586,000 households on Friday, said it was pausing the issuance of full benefits in light of the Supreme Court decision. It had hoped to issue them over the weekend. “The hard-working people and families who rely on SNAP benefits deserve certainty, not confusion about whether they’ll be able to put meals on the table this weekend and the rest of the month,” North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement Saturday. “I am urging for a swift resolution by the courts and some humanity from the Trump administration so North Carolina families can receive the support they need.” In Massachusetts, Democratic Gov. Maura Healey said that residents should continue spending the benefits on their EBT cards, noting the state funded them in accordance with USDA’s Friday guidance before the Supreme Court’s pause. “If President Trump wants to penalize states for preventing Americans from going hungry, we will see him in court,” Healey said in a statement Sunday, adding that state officials will continue to work to “make sure everyone gets the full benefits they are owed.” CNN is reaching out to other states to ask the status of their SNAP programs. CNN’s John Fritze and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",left

"Trump administration announces trade frameworks with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador Washington — The Trump administration has reached frameworks for reciprocal trade agreements with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador, the White House announced Thursday, although details of the frameworks are still emerging. The tariff rate for most goods from Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina will continue to be 10%, while Ecuador will remain at 15%, senior administration officials told reporters on a briefing call. But there will be tariff relief on a number of items, particularly those that can't be grown in the U.S. Senior administration officials didn't list those items, nor do the joint statements about the frameworks released by the White House, but one senior administration official anticipated that coffee and bananas from Ecuador, for instance, would see tariff relief. ""The United States commits to remove its reciprocal tariffs on certain qualifying exports from Ecuador that cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States in sufficient quantities,"" the framework joint statement for Ecuador released by the White House says. Senior administration officials couldn't provide details on how the trade agreements would affect the cost of goods like coffee, cocoa or bananas, which the U.S. imports from Central and South American nations, although one senior administration official said it would likely have ""positive"" effects. Those specific commodities are important because ""we don't make those in the United States,"" the official said. ""Our expectation is that there will be some positive effects for prices for things like coffee, cocoa, bananas,"" the official said. The White House said the administration will work to finalize the agreements in the coming weeks. Senior administration officials said the agreement frameworks are largely focused on allowing those foreign markets to accept more U.S. goods. Generally, the agreements also aim to open up markets to import U.S. agricultural products and to prohibit imposing digital services taxes on U.S. companies. The U.S. has reached trade deals of some nature with the European Union, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea and the United Kingdom, among other countries.",left
"'It's insane': ACA policyholders say soaring health insurance premiums are jeopardizing lives One said she's being ""run out of my country because of healthcare costs."" Colorado mom Astrid Storey, a thyroid cancer patient with an autoimmune disorder, was recently notified that her monthly premiums under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will jump by nearly $500 in 2026. A naturalized U.S. citizen from Panama, she said she's now contemplating what was once unthinkable: giving up her American dream and moving to a country with universal health care. Nathan Boye of Orlando, Florida, has diabetes and said he's been informed the monthly premiums for his ACA policy would soar from $28 to more than $700. The married father-of-three said he is now considering foregoing health insurance altogether. And Doug Butchart, whose wife, Shadene, is living with the neurological disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) said he doesn't know how he's going to pay for her medications. A retired mechanic from Elgin, Illinois, Butchart said he's gotten a notice that the monthly premiums on his wife's ACA policy will climb to $2,000. Combined with an annual deductible of more than $8,000 and $10,000 in out-of-pocket expenses, he said his wife's health care costs will total more than his monthly Social Security check, which they both live on. An estimated 22 million of the 24 million ACA marketplace enrollees are currently receiving enhanced premium tax credits to lower their monthly premiums, which were part of the original ACA legislation and expanded in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic under the American Rescue Plan. But with the tax credits set to expire at the end of this year, many policyholders are learning the ACA, commonly referred to as Obamacare, will no longer be affordable unless Congress intervenes. An extension of the tax credits was not included in President Donald Trump's megabill, which was signed into law in July. The issue has become a political football, prolonging the government shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history. The majority of Democrats have refused to vote to reopen the government until Republicans agree to extend the ACA subsidies. But GOP leaders say they won't negotiate until a clean funding bill passes and the government reopens. As both sides blame each other for the shutdown, millions of Americans who bought into the ACA marketplace find themselves caught in the crossfire of the stalemate. Premiums set to rise even without the tax credits Storey, a graphic designer and owner of a small business in Denver, said she doesn't receive the ACA tax credits. But in a notice from her insurance provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, which she shared with ABC News, her monthly premiums are set to rise from $1,400 to nearly $1,900. ""I have an autoimmune disease, and I also have thyroid cancer. So, I had very specific needs as to which doctors and which medicines I needed to have covered in this plan,"" Storey said, adding that she has a $2,000 deductible and many out-of-pocket expenses. Storey, 45, said she purchased her policy through Connect for Health Colorado, her state's ACA portal, and has been working with a broker provided by the insurance carrier to help navigate the added costs. Storey said her husband, Denis, who has been doing contracting work for her business, has taken a part-time job at a Starbucks to help make ends meet. But Storey said there is a limit to how much more she can pay for health care. If her premium rises to $2,500 a month, she said that she and her family will sell all their belongings and leave the country. Storey said she also has citizenship in Panama and Spain, the latter of which has universal health care. ""I have a lot of feelings about being run out of my country because of health care costs,"" Storey said. ""The American dream is a disappointment when it comes to health care."" In a statement to ABC News, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said that its ACA plan rates ""reflect the care and costs we expect members to use next year. Like other insurers, we’re seeing higher utilization and more complex care among ACA members -- particularly in emergency room visits, behavioral health and specialty pharmacy. For instance, ACA members use the ER at nearly twice the rate of those with employer-sponsored coverage."" Laid off due to tariffs, now facing more than a 2,500% jump in premiums Boye, from Florida, said he currently pays $28 a month for his ACA plan through Blue Cross Blue Shield, and that 90% of the medications he needs to control his diabetes are covered. He was notified last month that the monthly premium is set to rise to $733 without financial help, a 2,518% increase. Boye told ABC News on Thursday that after doing more research and reapplying through the ACA portal, he found a plan that has monthly premiums of $113 a month, contingent on a $620 tax credit. Boye said he qualified for the ACA tax credits after he was laid off earlier this year as an operations manager for a company that imported medical supplies from China. ""We had to close down because of the tariff. It made it impossible to import,"" Boye said. While he has picked up part-time work, he said he enrolled at Valencia College in Orlando to finish his degree in business administration. His wife, he said, has insurance through her job as a teacher's assistant at the University of Central Florida, where she is also studying history. He said their three children, ages 11 to 16, are insured through Medicaid. Boye said he won't be able to pay the increase in his premiums, and is hoping Congress works out a deal to restore the ACA tax credits. He said he has until mid-December to reenroll in his plan. But if the tax credits are not restored, Boye said he is contemplating making a radical change. ""I gave up on the idea of having health care,"" Boye said. Boye said he's already started researching discount drug companies and cash-pay programs on how he can purchase on his own the two primary medications he uses to control diabetes. He showed ABC News an invoice he got in September indicating his insurance covered the $1,669 price of his primary medication, Jardiance. Boye said his current predicament has left him feeling like a ""tiny fish that does not matter."" ""Realistically, I have no control over any of this,"" he said. ""I'm just a person who has to navigate the waters and find a solution."" In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Florida Blue said that, next year, there will be ""higher insurance costs for many, and government financial help (premium tax credits) will decrease if the enhanced premium tax credits expire, as they are planned to."" The organization said it understood members' concerns and is committed to supporting members, but added that premium increases ""are an industry-wide issue, a necessary but concerning response to federal regulatory changes including the scheduled expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits at the end of 2025, as well as the rising cost and utilization of medical care and prescription drugs."" 'It’s real people that all of this is affecting' The Butcharts, from Illinois, traveled to Washington, D.C., this week with members of the Muscular Dystrophy Association to discuss their precarious situation with congressional leaders, including their two Illinois senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, both Democrats. The 67-year-old Doug Butchart said he wanted to show the lawmakers ""that it's for real, that it's real people that all of this is affecting."" Butchart said he has received notification, which he shared with ABC News, that the monthly premiums on his wife's ACA policy through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois will rise from $603.82 to up to $2,000 without the tax credits in 2026. According to the notice he received, even with a tax credit estimated at $738, the monthly premium would be nearly $1,400. ""It's insane,"" Butchart told ABC News. He said his 58-year-old wife was diagnosed with ALS eight years ago, adding that about 10% of ALS patients survive that long. Butchart said his wife's main medication, Radicava, costs about $15,000 a month, and another medication costs $4,000 for a three-month supply. While insurance has covered most of their medical costs, Butchart said his wife's out-of-pocket expenses last year were about $3,000. He said that without the tax credits, and on top of the increased monthly premiums, his wife will have an $8,000 deductible in 2026, and her out-of-pocket expenses could top $10,000. ""That's a lot of money, way more money than we get in a year,"" said Butchart. He said he and his wife live off his Social Security income and that she does not qualify for Medicaid or any disability income. ""I don't want to put ourselves in a position where we're in debt. I'm not 20 years old or 30 years old where I can go out and get a second job,"" Butchart said. In a statement to ABC News, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois said it ""remains steadfast in its commitment to a stable health insurance market with competitive plan choices in the individual market, as we have since the inception of the ACA."" ""The rates for 2026 coverage include both new and current individual ACA-compliant plans and reflects industry-wide changes to the market, including the anticipated expiration of enhanced premium tax credits at the end of 2025. Plans are priced to reflect anticipated health care needs,"" the company said. But Butchart said the he still doesn't see how the company can ""justify"" such increases in premiums. “I wish the people who are making decisions and setting the prices were in the same position as we are,"" Butchart said.

"Generations work on family farms. With costs high and prices low, farmers worry they may lose it all. Tennessee farmer Franklin Carmack is haunted by concerns that he could lose the family farm. Carmack, a fifth-generation farmer, has been forced to take on work outside his fields — selling T-shirts, driving trucks and repairing boats — to try and ease his financial burden. It's affected his health, Carmack said, and he now takes four blood pressure pills a day. He thinks about the issue when he goes to bed at night. ""What's gonna be left in a year, two years? Am I the one that broke what started in the late 1800s?"" Carmack said he wonders. He's not alone: America's farmers are facing high costs, low prices and challenges from tariffs. Major row crops, including corn, soybeans, cotton and wheat, have not been profitable since at least 2022, according to United States Department of Agriculture data. Farmer frustrations Carmack and longtime friend Jeffrey Daniels grow cotton, soybeans and corn on their respective family farms. This year, instead of showing off crops at the West Tennessee State Fair, the pair sold T-shirts, made from cotton they grew, in an attempt to offset their losses in the fields. They sold about 250 shirts for $35 each, but it was hardly enough. This year, they expect to lose nearly $800,000 combined. Times are especially tough now because of input costs: everything a farmer needs to pull income from the ground, such as seed, equipment parts and fertilizer. Those costs have increased by more than 30% in the last five years, according to USDA data. This is, in part, due to inflation and rising interest rates. Cotton farmers have struggled with dwindling prices and decreased global demand as clothing manufacturers use more synthetic fabrics. ""The morale in the farming industry, not just farmers, is the lowest I've ever seen,"" Carmack said. ""Everybody's on edge."" In the first six months of 2025, there were 57% more farm bankruptcies than during the same period last year, according to United States Courts. Tariffs and the promise of federal help Daniels and Carmack say tariffs have made this year even harder. Soybeans have long been the largest U.S. export crop, worth nearly $25 billion last year, according to USDA. China, which primarily uses soybeans to feed its massive livestock industry, was the largest foreign buyer of America's soybeans. Sales ground to a halt in May when China stopped buying all U.S. soybeans as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs. Following a meeting last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mr. Trump said the additional 100% tariffs on certain imports from China, which he previously said would take effect Nov. 1, will not be implemented. Tariffs have also impacted the prices farmers pay to buy equipment. ""Anything that comes from China that's on that sprayer, there's a tariff and they're just going to pass it directly to us,"" Daniels said. Last week, Mr. Trump and Xi reached a one-year trade deal. But farmers said whatever comes next, the problems on farms run deep. ""Do you just keep going, rolling the dice, hoping things will turn? I mean, it's not looking good,"" Daniels said. Mr. Trump has promised a new bailout for American farmers – as much as $13 billion that he said would be paid for by the tariffs. ""It will help pay some bills, but that's not fixing the problem. It's a Band-Aid when we need stitches,"" Carmack said. Carmack and Daniels, like many farmers 60 Minutes spoke with in Tennessee and Missouri, said they'd rather work their fields than rely on taxpayer money. High numbers of suicides among farmers Farmers 60 Minutes met with say there are also worries about suicide in agricultural communities. Concerns for neighbors rise when crop sales drop. The suicide rate among agriculture workers is three times higher than it is among the general working population, according ot the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's most recent data in 2021. 60 Minutes' reporting shows that many rural mental health groups are seeing increased crisis calls to their hotlines. Jolie Foreman, who runs Shelby County Cares, a nonprofit organization focused on the high number of suicides among farmers, said her county has the highest rate of suicide per capita in the state of Missouri. The county has one therapist for about 6,000 people. ""[We] cannot really determine our success,"" Foreman said. ""We only can calculate the losses."" Though it's difficult to know how many lives have been saved, Foreman said she believes her program is working. In neighboring Macon County, Missouri, just a few miles away, there were two confirmed farm suicides this year. Foreman said she worries she could see an increase in the suicide rate because of the bleak financial situation for farmers. Shelby County Cares connects farmers with therapists, either in person or remotely. Foreman said walk-ins and calls to her office have increased since the beginning of the year. She's learned the best way to get farmers, who are traditionally stoic and fiercely independent, to talk is through their wives and through sharing food. Foreman said she personally knew farmers who took their own lives. ""In my own family, we've definitely had tragedy and have lost some very, you know, important people in our own family,"" she said. Since the 1970s, Foreman's father-in-law, Brent Foreman, has lost three relatives — all farmers — to suicide. Two neighbors of the family farm also recently took their own lives. ""I've always had a fear for my kids and now my grandkids that we sure don't want history to repeat itself,"" he said. ""You know, no matter how bad things get, things always have a way of working out. They'll always get better."" Faith in Trump's plan Brent Foreman and his son Jarrell grow more than 1,000 acres of soybeans and 650 acres of corn on a farm they manage themselves. They also raise more than 200 head of cattle, which means they are not reliant on soybeans as their sole source of income and can afford to wait for details on Mr. Trump's new trade deal. ""I have a lot of faith in him, and a lot of trust in him. And I think he's trying to make us the best deal he can for the whole country, but for the American farmer, for the long term,"" Brent Foreman said. Nearly 80% of voters in what are called farming-dependent counties voted for Mr. Trump in the last election, according to Investigate Midwest. ""I feel like a lot of American farmers, cattle people, it's a lot, a lot of people probably feel let down,"" Daniels said. ""Maybe there's a method to the madness, you know, that's still to be seen."" Many are now taking their frustrations directly to Republican lawmakers at town halls across the country. Carmack welcomed Mr. Trump to visit his farm. ""I'd show him the daily life that I do from cleaning equipment, running equipment, dispatching trucks,"" Carmack said. ""And then I'd hand him a stack of bills. And then I would show him the receipts, what I'm getting from my crop. He's a smart man. I'm not going to take that away from him. And it won't take him the five minutes to say, 'This isn't going to work.'""

"Costco seeks 'full refund' for tariffs in new lawsuit against Trump administration President Donald Trump imposed a flurry of tariffs earlier this year. Wholesale giant Costco has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for a ""full refund"" on import duties the company says it paid this year under global tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed by Costco at the U.S. Court of International Trade on Nov. 28, states that Congress, not the president, has the power to impose tariffs. Trump imposed a flurry of global tariffs in April, citing the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which gives the president power to regulate international commerce in the event of an ""unusual and extraordinary threat."" On Monday, Costco filed a motion to combine its lawsuit with nearly two dozen other lawsuits previously filed by other U.S. companies challenging the legality of Trump's IEEPA tariffs. ""The complaints are materially identical in allegations, theories, and ultimate requested relief,"" Costco wrote in its motion. One of the previously filed lawsuits is currently pending a decision at the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court strikes down Trump's tariffs, more than $90 billion of refunds could be owed. A decision is expected early next year. Costco's lawsuit states that the Court of International Trade and other federal courts ""have agreed the IEEPA duties are not authorized"" and are unlawful. ""This separate action is necessary, however, because even if the IEEPA duties and underlying executive orders are held unlawful by the Supreme Court, importers that have paid IEEPA duties, including Plaintiff, are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief,"" the lawsuit states. Costco, a membership warehouse club with over 800 locations across the U.S., according to its website, is seeking an immediate injunction against having to pay additional tariffs on products already imported while the Supreme Court case is pending. Costco is also seeking a refund for the tariff payments it incurred. In a statement to ABC News on Tuesday, White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said, ""The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court’s speedy and proper resolution of this matter."" Costco declined to comment on the lawsuit. ABC News' Taylor Dunn contributed to this report.",left
"Sen. Amy Klobuchar says ""future of capitalism"" at stake in Supreme Court tariffs case The Supreme Court sounded skeptical on Wednesday about President Trump's sweeping tariff agenda. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota attended the hearing and joins ""The Takeout"" with her takeaways.",left
"During both his presidential terms, Donald Trump has longed to make Americans happy by mailing them checks from the government adorned with his own signature in case anyone wants to write him a thank-you note in the form of a vote. So it’s not surprising that his big idea for responding to the rise of “affordability” as a national political issue is to send out $2,000 checks, allegedly to be financed by his trade-war tariffs. Do people think tariffs boost consumer prices? Okay, then, here’s a rebate! Or a “tariff dividend,” as he calls it. Now, that is very unlikely to come to pass for a variety of reasons. For one thing, Trump is vastly overestimating the tariff revenue that’s coming in. For another, his own administration and perhaps soon the Supreme Court are putting the brakes on his tariff offensive. And even more obviously, authorizing $2,000 checks from Trump for everybody at this particular moment has zero support among Democrats and not much support among Republicans, who mostly seem to be rolling their eyes over it. If they take it seriously at all, they tend to recommend that any “tariff dividends,” should they actually emerge, be used to reduce the public debt that Trump has never seemed to worry about for a moment. But the most telling (not to mention hilarious) reaction to the “tariff dividend” idea has come from Trump’s own Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, as Axios reported: The administration is hopeful Americans won’t necessarily spend the $2,000 tariff checks President Trump has promised, and instead pump them into “Trump accounts” for kids, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says … The risk of rising prices remains a huge concern for consumers, and against that backdrop, Fox News asked Bessent Tuesday night how the government would avoid another bout of stimulus-driven inflation if the checks happen. “Maybe we could persuade Americans to save that, because one of the things that’s going to happen next year” is the start of “Trump accounts” to save for kids, Bessent said. So the president wants to send checks to folks who are worried about making ends meet today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. But his top economic adviser is telling them not to cash those checks to pay for their living costs but to save them instead because (quite accurately) spending the money might boost living costs even more. Bessent was clever enough to couch this blatant contradiction of the president’s wishes in a recommendation that the money should go into Trump-branded savings vehicles (the subsidized kiddie savings accounts created by the One Big Beautiful Act). But it’s probably not what the president had in mind when he imagined grateful Americans using those checks to pay for groceries and gasoline while uttering a prayer of thanksgiving for their benefactor the president — and vowing to vote Republican in the 2026 midterms. Vote-buying is a simple proposition, but the people around Trump keep trying to complicate it. No wonder he’s angry and frustrated about “affordability.”",left
"President Donald Trump said on Friday that any document signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen ""is hereby terminated."" ""I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden,"" Trump posted on his social media platform. It is unclear which orders Trump is referencing and how he is making those determinations. ABC News has reached out to the White House for more information. Trump claimed that the people who ""operated the Autopen did so illegally."" But the Justice Department's legal counsel states that autopens are lawful for signing bills into law. The president has repeatedly fixated on Biden's use of the autopen. In June, Trump claimed Biden aides illegally used the autopen to carry out ""radical"" policies and ordered the Justice Department and White House to investigate Biden’s mental state when he was in office. At the time, Biden issued a statement to ABC News calling the probe “nothing more than a mere distraction.” ""Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,"" Biden said in the June statement. Trump has said he has used an autopen for some trivial matters, but criticized its use for pardons. -ABC News' Lalee Ibssa and Selina Wang",left
"Many Americans worried about high prices might expect some relief if a deeply skeptical Supreme Court reins in President Donald Trump’s tariffs. If you’re among them, don’t get your hopes up. In a consequential Supreme Court case Wednesday, a majority of the justices expressed concern that Trump may have overstepped his authority in levying tariffs with practically zero limits. Trump has imposed enormous import taxes in a number of unprecedented ways: He placed tariffs high enough to effectively serve as a temporary embargo on all Chinese goods, retaliated against Brazil’s conviction of its former president and Trump ally Jair Bolsanaro, and pressured India to ditch Russian oil. Those tariffs have begun to raise some prices for Americans, who ranked the cost of living as the most important issue facing the country in a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Nearly three quarters (72%) of Americans say the US economy is in bad shape, and 61% say Trump’s policies have made economic conditions worse. The Supreme Court may ultimately rule the bulk of Trump’s tariffs – his signature economic policy – to be illegal. But that wouldn’t give Americans much of a breather: Tariffs haven’t raised prices as much as you may think. And Trump has other tools to raise tariffs even if the Supreme Court rules against him. Tariffs’ limited effect The US government’s inflation data shows tariffs have started to gradually raise some prices, particularly for goods that are almost exclusively imported, such as shoes and furniture. Still, the overall pace of price hikes has been far from dramatic. Annual inflation rose to 3% in September, the highest rate since January but far from the 9% rate during the post-pandemic inflation crisis. Tariffs have had a limited impact for a number of reasons. - Trump delayed the implementation of his most consequential tariffs multiple times. - Businesses stockpiled goods ahead of Trump’s tariffs. - Foreign trading partners (with the notable exception of China) largely chose not to retaliate, so the global trade war sort of never happened as expected. - Businesses have – for the most part – eaten much of the tariffs’ cost. That’s not to say tariffs are inconsequential. Businesses have chosen to pay roughly 80% of the tariffs’ cost – for now – according to a recent JPMorgan analysis. And what you’re not feeling in your pocket, you may be feeling in your job prospects: That hit to companies’ profit has contributed to America’s slowing job market, JPMorgan economist Michael Hanson says. And consumers could still pay more of tariffs’ cost down the line. There’s mounting evidence companies are preparing to pass along those costs: Recent Producer Price Index reports showed that businesses are beginning to raise their wholesale prices, indicating many companies have reached the limit of what they can pay for before charging customers more. And CEOs on recent earnings calls have said some higher prices are inevitable. “There is no free lunch,” Hanson said. “We continue to expect that consumers ultimately will foot most of the tariff bill.” Nevertheless, most inflation-weary Americans are upset with the economy because the cumulative effect of higher prices have been wreaking havoc on the economy for the past five years – not because of tariffs, specifically. The typical household is spending $1,043 more per month than they did at the start of 2021 – for the same stuff, according to Moody’s. Paychecks haven’t kept up. Inflation rose to a four-decade high in 2022. That means an entire generation of Americans had never experienced anything like the surging prices of the past several years. Although inflation – the rate of those price hikes – has since returned to normal, those higher prices haven’t really had time to settle into the country’s psyche. People are still shocked when they compare the prices they’re paying now to what they were paying just a few years ago. Typically, price hikes occur gradually, in such small increments you hardly notice. And for some products, like new technology, prices can actually fall over time as supply increases – that’s why you can get a high-quality gigantic 4K TV for a couple hundred bucks now, when those TVs would set you back thousands a few years ago. This is something different: The first inflation shock many Americans experienced hasn’t yet worn off, and tariffs are a convenient – if largely inaccurate – foil for their pain. Trump can still impose tariffs The Supreme Court isn’t exactly Sonic the Hedgehog. Even with an expedited case, the justices may not rule for several months. In the meantime, Trump can continue to impose his tariffs, and price hikes may ultimately start to take hold of the economy. But if the Supreme Court ultimately rules that the bulk of his tariffs are illegal, Trump has other options, including other laws he’s already used to raise some import levies. They may be more restrictive than his broad use of emergency powers, but they’re not part of the current case before the Supreme Court. For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the president to raise tariffs on national security grounds. Trump has used that to raise steel, aluminum and copper tariffs. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to raise tariffs on nations deemed to violate trade agreements. And Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, although never used, would allow the president to raise tariffs up to 50% on countries if they’re believed to be engaged in discriminatory trade practices. Trump called the case “life or death.” But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Erin Burnett Wednesday that he disagreed with the president. “It’s a factor,” Dimon said. “But it may not be the deciding factor” in whether the US economy keeps growing.
