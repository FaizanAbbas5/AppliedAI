"Trump’s Tariff Windfall Should Go to Parents President Trump has floated the idea of sending $2,000 checks to most Americans, funded by tariff revenue. The idea is to show Americans very directly how much the country is benefiting from the billions being paid in import duties. But a lump sum payment of $2,000 is not the best use of tariff revenue. Injecting a massive stimulus regardless of need risks fanning the flames of inflation. It’s likely that the Federal Reserve would seek to offset any boost in spending enabled by the check with higher interest rates. resident Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office on Oct. 16, 2025, in Washington, DC. (Francis Chung/Politico/Bloomberg via Getty Images)A better use of tariff revenue would be to dramatically expand the Child Tax Credit—delivered as quarterly payments rather than a year-end refund. This would provide meaningful, sustained support to families raising the next generation while avoiding the inflationary risks of universal cash payments. The math is straightforward. Tariffs are bringing in roughly $240 billion annually. The current Child Tax Credit costs about $120 billion per year and provides $2,000 per child. Instead of scattering money indiscriminately, we could use approximately $160 billion of that tariff revenue to restructure the credit this way: - $3,000 for the first child, - $4,000 for the second child, - $6,000 for the third child, - and $8,000 for the fourth and each additional child. The additional amounts above the current $2,000 baseline would be non-refundable—available only to families with tax liability. The idea is to provide tax relief rather than create another welfare program. Poorer families without tax liabilities would still get the existing refundable credit. Turning Tariff Revenue into a Pro-Family Tax Cut Consider what this means in practice. A family with three children currently receives $6,000 annually through the CTC. Under this expansion, they’d receive $13,000, an additional $7,000. Delivered quarterly, that’s $3,250 every three months. For a family with four children, the total rises to $21,000, or $5,250 per quarter. These aren’t trivial amounts. They represent meaningful support for families facing the actual costs of raising children: childcare that runs $10,000-$15,000 per child annually in many areas, rising food and clothing costs, educational expenses, and the countless other outlays that come with each additional child. Compare this to the proposed $2,000 universal checks. A family with four children would get $2,000 once. Under this alternative, they’d get $21,000 spread over the year. Which would actually help them manage the ongoing expenses of raising their family? The quarterly delivery mechanism matters. Rather than a one-time payment that hits the economy all at once—potentially driving up prices—quarterly payments align with the rhythm of family expenses. Parents need support in June for summer activities and in September for back-to-school costs, not just in April when they file their taxes. Spreading payments over time also reduces inflationary pressure by avoiding a sudden spike in aggregate demand. There’s a deeper logic to this structure. By making the additional amounts non-refundable and removing phase-outs at high income levels, this proposal targets families who are both paying substantial federal income taxes and raising multiple children. These are precisely the families that get squeezed hardest under current policy. Current policy claims to value family formation but does almost nothing to support it where it matters most. The existing Child Tax Credit phases out starting at $400,000 for married couples—not exactly a fortune when you’re raising multiple children in an expensive area. This expansion would remove those phase-outs, providing meaningful support to families regardless of income level, as long as they’re paying taxes. The contrast with universal checks is stark. Universal payments encourage consumption, which might make sense when the economy is slumping due to inadequate demand. It doesn’t make sense when the economy is growing rapidly and inflation remains stubbornly high. Family tax relief rewards investment in the future. Every child represents not just 18 years of expenses, but a future worker, taxpayer, and contributor to economic growth. If the goal of tariff policy is to rebuild American productive capacity, using the revenue to support American family formation is entirely consistent with that objective. This is also a better policy design than universal checks from an economic perspective. One-time payments tend to fuel spending surges as recipients treat them as windfalls. Research on previous stimulus programs shows that consumers spend a larger share of one-time payments than they do of regular income. Quarterly family payments, by contrast, are more likely to be incorporated into household budgets and used for necessary expenses rather than discretionary splurges. The political advantages are significant too. It’s more defensible to fiscal conservatives because it’s structured as tax relief for families with tax liability, not an expansion of the welfare state. And it gives Republicans something concrete on family values beyond rhetoric about the importance of marriage and children. The current debate over what to do with tariff revenue reveals a broader confusion about policy goals. It’s admirable to want to show Americans more directly the benefits of tariffs. But just doing that is short-sighted. We should aim higher by supporting American families and encouraging marriage, having children, and raising the next generation. Trump has made American renewal a central theme of his presidency. But renewal requires more than just reshoring factories and renegotiating trade deals. It requires families willing and able to have children. That won’t happen if policy continues to squeeze families with substantial tax burdens while offering minimal support for the enormous expenses of raising multiple children. The $2,000 checks would make headlines for a week and then be forgotten. Quarterly payments that actually help families manage the costs of raising children would be policy that matters. If we’re going to use tariff revenue for tax relief, let’s use it in a way that advances actual policy goals rather than just generating a news cycle.

"As the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing the limits of the executive branch’s authority on tariffs, it is important to consider the tradeoffs that come with free trade. In American political and business circles, free trade has long been the favored mantra. Investors, executives, and most politicians speak of it with near-religious conviction. According to Google Trends, Americans have searched for “free trade” roughly twice as often as for “fair trade” since 2004. Mentions of fair or reciprocal trade, by contrast, are far rarer—though Donald Trump managed to raise their profile over the past decade. This imbalance in attention is not just a matter of economic theory. It reflects the political arithmetic that makes free trade a perennial favorite and fair trade a hard sell in Washington. This arithmetic follows an old Chinese proverb: “It is better to break one finger than to injure ten” (伤其十指，不如断其一指). But doing this can land the American economy in a ditch. Politicians rarely lose votes backing free trade, because the numbers—of voters, donors, and dollars—tilt decisively in its favor. On the one hand, tariffs are the inevitable instrument of fair trade. They help domestic producers compete, reopen shuttered plants, and revive manufacturing towns. They also allow middle-aged steelworkers, for example, to keep well-paying jobs rather than take minimum-wage ones. But tariffs come with visible costs on the other hand. Importers pay first, then try—often unsuccessfully—to pass them along to consumers. Exporters and original equipment manufacturers absorb another share to keep their business. Eventually, the burden ripples through currencies, supply chains, and countries. As such, tariffs are not exactly a tax on consumers in the conventional sense, even though consumers may and frequently do end up paying higher prices. As a result, politicians follow the Chinese proverb instinctively: higher tariffs hurt many consumers a little, but help a few workers a lot. Lower tariffs, meanwhile, help many consumers a little, but hurt a few workers a lot. Faced with a choice between slightly annoying millions or devastating thousands, politicians will choose the latter. They’d rather break one finger than to injure ten. And so, free trade wins. There’s more. Advocating free trade is not only politically safer—it’s more lucrative. Campaign donations tend to flow from the beneficiaries of global capital mobility, not from the victims of industrial decline. Free trade in America, of course, does not mean reciprocal trade. Foreign firms often enjoy wide access to U.S. markets, while American companies face high barriers abroad. This asymmetry gives foreign producers a structural advantage. They can exploit scale economies, invest more heavily in innovation, and recruit global talent—all while American firms face shrinking market share. Imagine a pharmaceutical company in New Jersey with a patented drug. If it produces in the U.S., it can sell domestically—but faces steep tariffs abroad. If it produces, say in China, however, it can sell both in China and in the U.S. tariff-free. The “giant sucking sound” Ross Perot once warned about is the sound of capital following profits—away from American workers and communities. As JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon recently lamented, “It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100% of our penicillin to come from China, and all of our rare earths, and all of our advanced chipmaking tools. We need to get our act together.” Yet the arithmetic of modern politics stands in the way. Capital is mobile; labor is not. Free trade enriches many investors by a small margin but impoverishes some workers by a large one. Fair or reciprocal trade, conversely, would slightly reduce returns for many investors to substantially improve conditions for a few workers. Given that political campaigns depend on money more than on gratitude, it’s easy to see which side wins. The irony is that by repeatedly “breaking one finger to save ten,” we may end up with none. Each individual decision to favor capital over labor, imports over production, or global supply chains over domestic resilience may seem compelling and rational in isolation. But cumulatively, they hollow out the national hand that once built and held the global economy. To “get our act together,” policymakers must change the arithmetic itself. Sometimes, it is wiser to “injure ten fingers a little” than to break one entirely. The business community can help by following the lead of companies like Apple—who has pledged to invested $600 billion in four years as part of its new American Manufacturing Program—and JP Morgan Chase—who is committing to facilitating and financing $1.5 trillion in the next decade to support U.S. economic security and resilience. Efforts like these allow the system to heal and keep all ten fingers intact. It’s time policymakers, business communities, and even consumers do the right thing and give fair trade a chance, even if it means we all must make some small sacrifices.

"Six months ago, CEOs of the world’s largest companies were preparing for turbulence. In an April survey by Fortune and Deloitte, 58% of global chief executives described their 12‑month economic outlook as pessimistic—half were simply cautious, while 8% were very pessimistic. Their gloom stemmed from fears over sweeping tariffs and tightening global financial conditions. Today, however, that sentiment has shifted dramatically. In the latest October survey, only 32% of CEOs now describe themselves as pessimistic about the global economy over the next year. Most say their concerns have eased, noting that tariffs have not disrupted global trade as feared. While few CEOs are celebrating just yet, the overall mood has improved. Their focus has shifted to managing a still-volatile but increasingly stable global landscape, where AI-driven innovation is taking center stage. The numbers to know 32% … of CEOs have a “pessimistic” (30%) or “very pessimistic” (2%) outlook for the global economy over the next 12 months. 26 … the percentage-point decline in pessimism since CEOs were last asked the same question in April 2025—at the height of the financial markets’ so-called “tariff tantrum.” 21% … of CEOs have a “pessimistic” (18%) or “very pessimistic” (3%) outlook for their industry performance over the next 12 months. 2% … of CEOs have a “pessimistic” (2%) or “very pessimistic” (0%) outlook for their company performance over the next 12 months. 37% … of CEOs say they think newly imposed tariffs will have a negative impact on their business. Another 51% say the impact will be neutral—meaning tariffs will bring a roughly equal mix of benefits and risks—while 10% say the tariffs will have a positive impact on their business. 80% … of CEOs say they are likely (38%) or very likely (42%) to implement cost-cutting measures over the next 12 months to offset higher costs related to current economic and trade policy uncertainties. 60% … of CEOs say AI will have a significant (45%) or transformational (15%) impact on their core processes over the next one to three years. The big picture After months of volatility and tariff worries, CEOs are starting to breathe easier. The Fortune and Deloitte survey finds leaders far less pessimistic about the global economy than they were in April. Many are now channeling energy toward cost discipline and AI-driven innovation rather than crisis management. It’s a shift from panic to pragmatism in the C-suite. A few deeper takeaways… CEOs are less bearish on the global economy than they were this spring Earlier this year, CEO sentiment took a sharp turn south amid what many dubbed the “tariff tantrum.” As trade tensions flared and questions mounted about how new import duties might ripple through global supply chains, 58% of CEOs told Fortune in April that they were pessimistic about the world economy’s outlook over the next 12 months. Six months later, that mood has eased. In the October survey, just 32% of CEOs described their outlook as pessimistic—a notable drop, though still above the lows seen in late 2024, when only 18% felt bearish. The shift suggests that while global growth remains uneven and risks persist, executives are adapting to the policy landscape and see less chance of a near-term downturn. The rebound in confidence comes as inflation pressures have remained in check and the Federal Reserve has resumed cutting short-term rates. Still, optimism is far from universal. Several respondents said ongoing geopolitical tensions, supply chain realignments, and policy uncertainty continue to cloud their long-term planning. In short, the panic of spring has given way to a more measured realism—CEOs aren’t panicked or exuberant, but they remain a bit cautious. CEOs see tariffs as a drag on the U.S. economy—but less so on their own companies Most CEOs think newly imposed tariffs will hurt the broader economy, even if their own firms can adapt. In Fortune’s October 2025 survey, 78% said tariffs will have a negative or somewhat negative impact on the U.S. economy. Yet when asked about their own company, more than half (51%) said the impact will be neutral, and only around one-third (38%) expect a negative or somewhat negative impact on their own company. That disconnect suggests CEOs may be either overestimating the drag on the macroeconomy—or underestimating how those same pressures could eventually reach their bottom line. In short, CEOs see tariffs as bad for business—just not necessarily for their business. CEOs plan to cut costs before passing them to customers With trade and economic uncertainty still lingering, most CEOs say their first move won’t be to raise prices—it’ll be to rein in expenses. According to Fortune’s October 2025 CEO survey, a combined 80% of respondents said they are likely or very likely to implement cost-cutting measures over the next 12 months to offset rising trade and policy-related costs. By comparison, about 64% said they plan to raise prices on goods or services, while only 43% expect to absorb those higher costs, even temporarily. The data suggest CEOs are preparing for a period of tighter margins and unpredictable input costs, but are still wary of testing customers’ tolerance for price hikes too quickly. CEOs say AI is already reshaping their core operations CEOs were most likely to cite core processes and resource allocation as areas seeing the deepest transformation. Around 60% of respondents said AI will have a significant or transformational effect on their core processes over the next one to three years. AI’s influence is also extending into long-term vision, growth strategy, and competitive positioning, where roughly half of CEOs reported at least a moderate level of impact. Methodology Fortune surveyed CEOs in collaboration with Deloitte between Oct. 3–16. A total of 69 responded to the survey, which was sent to the Fortune CEO Community. That includes chief executives from Fortune 500 and Global 500 companies as well as those attending Fortune conferences.",right
"Steel industry says Carney is moving in the right direction, but needs to pick up the pace Sector undergoing fundamental restructuring as market shifts away from United States and its tariffs Prime Minister Mark Carney is not moving as fast or as far on changing steel policies as industry players want, but they generally concede he is slowly taking major steps to transform the sector. His latest proposals will slash steel imports from free-trade-partner countries for the first time, further reduce steel imports from non-free-trade countries, cut imports of steel derivative products — essentially raw steel that has been minimally transformed — subsidize the cost of shipping steel across the country and step up border enforcement to ensure compliance. Taken together, the steps are what steel producers want, but haven’t come as quickly or reached as far as they’d like. “He is plodding along, as opposed to giving much faster relief,” Butch Mandel, chief executive and founder of Concord, Ont.-based Welded Tube of Canada Corp., said. “I suspect he’s going to get close, if not all the way, to what we’re asking, so why wait?” He said he found the pace of change highly “frustrating,” but he doesn’t fault Carney, given the challenges he faces, which include an unpredictable trade war that has left Canada’s steel sector highly exposed to downturn. The Canadian Steel Producers Association (CSPA) has been open about wanting a federal policy that slashes steel imports to 20 per cent of 2024 levels. “The ask of the industry was straightforward and it has not relented,” Mandel said. “We just said take everyone down to 20 per cent.” Carney on Wednesday tightened steel import quotas to restrict non-free-trade countries to importing no more than 20 per cent of the volumes they imported in 2024. Above that volume, they will encounter a 50 per cent tariff. For the first time, he also placed significant restrictions on steel imports from free-trade partners, which includes countries such as South Korea and Vietnam, reducing their shipments to 75 per cent of their import volume in 2024 before hitting a 50 per cent tariff. The policy excludes the U.S. and Mexico. The moves come after months of lobbying and still don’t reach the 20 per cent line on all countries, but it’s a policy that tightens controls on imports. “I’ve always looked at this stuff stepwise … and I consider this a very big step,” Catherine Cobden, chief executive of the CSPA, said. “We’ll take stock of things and come back to ask for adjustments if it’s not working.” For now, she said she was very happy to see policies that will open up new domestic demand. Carney also announced a global 25 per cent tariff on steel-derivative products from all countries, which won praise from Rita Rahmati, a spokesperson for the Canadian Institute of Steel Construction, a lobby group for steel fabricators and other companies that add value to raw steel. She said her organization had asked for such a policy months ago. Previously, by adding a screw or doing minor work to steel, foreign companies could avoid Canadian tariff quotas on steel. The new policy should plug “the loopholes,” she said. But it’s only a 25 per cent tariff and the industry might want a higher duty rate. “We’re at the point right now where we’re just pleased to have that,” Rahmati said. “We‘re not going to complain and say we’d like it to be higher.” Still, it’s clear the steel industry is undergoing a fundamental restructuring. Colin Mang, an economist at McMaster University in Hamilton, described it as a “reinvention” of the Canadian steel industry from a “north-to-south” focus to a new “east-to-west” focus. Historically, Canada has exported significant quantities of steel to the U.S. since there are major population centres with industrial demand just south of Quebec and Ontario, where Canada’s major mills are located. Now, producers must look to markets such as British Columbia to offset losses in the U.S., where tariffs are making their products less competitive. Cobden was in Victoria on Wednesday to meet with industry executives about how to accomplish this when Carney unveiled his latest steel policies, one of which aims to work with Canada’s two major railways to cut rail rates by half for domestically produced steel. “It’s definitely a huge benefit to the industry, all the stuff the government announced this week, and it’s good for the long-term vision of increasing internal trade,” he said. “We’ve talked about that for 130 years, and it’s really only in the past year that we’ve actually gotten around to taking the issue seriously.” There’s already a huge reshuffling of the steel industry underway, he said. Steel exports have fallen about 28 per cent while imports have fallen by 24 per cent. Chinese steel shipments to Canada have fallen to six per cent in 2025 from about 7.4 per cent of the total in 2024. The U.S. remains a major source of steel imports, but its role is declining. Through the first 11 months of 2025, Canada imported 1.4 million tonnes from the U.S., compared to 2.2 million in all of 2025, Mang said. Some other hard-hit industries, such as lumber, may be able to export their products to markets other than the U.S. But he said there aren’t any other likely export markets for steel other than the U.S. for a variety of reasons. “The Canadian steel industry will need to reorganize itself to focus primarily on serving the needs of the Canadian market,” he said. “The sooner they make that transition, the better.” Carney has been clear that he is taking a slow, safe approach. In private talks with industry members, he has said he doesn’t want to disrupt the economy by hastily slapping on tariffs that will be difficult to collect and could cause shortages of certain parts for businesses, according to a source who described one such discussion. “You don’t do it overnight because people have certain relationships, certain contracts,” Carney said when asked at a press conference on Wednesday why one of his policies won’t take effect until the end of January. “But you also don’t do it a year from now, or else it doesn’t have any benefit for the Canadian industry.” The policy in question are “remissions” that allow Canadians to import some steel products from the U.S. on a duty-free basis. Despite lobbying from steel producers to not allow remissions on U.S. steel at all, Carney issued yet another extension, but called it the final one. “I keep coming back to it; he’s saying things that no Canadian steel producer could argue with,” Mandel said. “The problem is he’s not going as far as I think he could go.” • Email: gfriedman@postmedia.com Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Shopify merchants not weighed down much by trade war, company says As retailers head into their busiest shopping season, they and their customers don’t appear to be feeling too bogged down by U.S. tariffs that have coloured much of the year. That’s according to executives at Shopify Inc., one of the world’s most prominent makers of e-commerce software. “When we look at the trade routes, when we look at the percentage of inbound versus outbound in the U.S., when we look at what we’re seeing on de minimis, we’ve not seen any significant impacts on our merchants,” chief financial officer Jeff Hoffmeister said on a Tuesday call with analysts. Economists have been closely watching the retail industry since Donald Trump kicked off his U.S. presidency by putting Canada and several other nations in his crosshairs at the start of the year. While he hasn’t made good on all of his threats, products like steel, aluminum, lumber and some auto parts crossing the Canada-U.S. border have all been slapped with higher duties. The de minimis exemption, a longtime U.S. trade rule that has allowed goods valued under US$800 to skip the duties, has also ended. Some feared the moves would result in a massive upheaval for businesses, but Hoffmeister said so far, Shopify’s merchants are “adapting quickly.” While many responded to April tariff announcements by raising prices, it’s been a less popular strategy lately. “The level of pricing increases is, in fact, slightly lower than the trends we were seeing last quarter,” Hoffmeister said. His remarks came as Shopify reported a blockbuster third quarter with a profit of US$264 million and 32 per cent jump in revenue, when the results are compared with a year ago. The company, which keeps its books in U.S. dollars, said its profit amounted to 20 cents US per diluted share for the period ended Sept. 30 compared with a profit of US$828 million or 64 cents US a year ago. On an adjusted basis, Shopify said it earned 34 cents US per share in its latest quarter compared with an adjusted profit of 36 cents US per share a year ago. Revenue for the quarter totalled US$2.84 billion, up from US$2.16 billion in the same quarter last year. Shopify president Harley Finkelstein, who joined Hoffmeister on the analyst call, saw the result as a sign that Shopify “can balance both growth and profitability.” “While we’re continuously evolving, the story of our results remains incredibly consistent,” he said. Some of Shopify’s growth can be attributed to artificial intelligence. It’s been increasingly embedding the technology in its software to ease some of the burdens merchants face and is pushing staff to use it to make them more effective. With AI now becoming so “reflexive” and its automation driving so many productivity gains, Hoffmeister said the company has been able to “redeploy talent to the highest-impact work.” Thus, Shopify’s head count has consistently been flat to down, both sequentially and year-over-year, and its operating expenses have dropped from 45 per cent in 2023 to 37 per cent this year. Another driver of Shopify’s growth has been its ability to cater to so many industries. While Hoffmeister listed apparel, accessories, health, food and beverage, beauty, home, and garden as strong performers in Shopify’s third quarter, it is also seeing rapid growth in other areas, where it’s won business away from larger enterprise platforms. For example, Shopify’s pet supplies vertical grew by more than 50 per cent, and arts and entertainment were up 45 per cent. “All roads lead to Shopify,” Finkelstein said. “Whether it’s food or manufacturing or education or even automotive, these are verticals traditionally, we didn’t go after and now, we’re winning them.” The success has showed up in numbers like Shopify’s merchant solutions revenue. It amounted to US$2.15 billion, up from US$1.55 billion a year ago, while subscription solutions revenue totalled US$699 million, up from US$610 million in the same quarter last year. Looking forward to the upcoming holiday season, Shopify said it expects its fourth-quarter revenue to grow at a percentage rate in the mid-to-high twenties on a year-over-year basis. The numbers will reflect a shift Finkelstein has seen in Black Friday and Cyber Monday. “It used to be a few peak sales days, but now it stretches across the whole quarter and it’s more global than ever,” he said.

"“It’ll happen slowly, and then all at once.” That’s how Jim Morrow, founder and chief investment officer of Callodine Capital, describes the eventual – inevitable – unwinding of what he calls “the most crowded trade in history.” Of course, he isn’t just paraphrasing Ernest Hemingway—he’s talking about the AI race, and the trillion-dollar deals so overstretched they’re better described as knots than trades. And he’s not alone in sounding alarms. Michael Burry—the investor of Big Short fame who famously predicted the 2008 housing collapse—broke a two-year silence this week to say nearly the same thing: that Big Tech’s AI-era profits are built on “one of the most common frauds in the modern era”—stretching the depreciation schedule (some, including Burry, would say cheating the depreciation schedule). And it landed with extra weight: earlier this week, Burry quietly deregistered his investing firm, Scion Asset Management, effectively stepping away from managing outside money or filing public disclosures. Some analysts interpreted the move as less of an ominous sign and more, as Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, told CNBC, stepping away “from a game he believes is fundamentally rigged.” “On to much better things,” Burry hinted on X, with a new launch expected on November 25. Freed from the obligations of reporting and client management, Burry returned to X with a message that cut straight through the current AI euphoria. To him, the boom in GPUs, data centers, and trillion-dollar AI bets isn’t evidence of unstoppable growth; it’s evidence of a financial cycle that looks increasingly distorted, increasingly crowded, and increasingly fragile. Burry put numbers to it. In a post on X, the investor estimated that Big Tech will understate depreciation by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028, inflating reported profits by 26.9% at Oracle and 20.8% at Meta, to name two of his specific targets. Meta did not respond to a request for comment. Oracle declined to comment. “He’s spot on,” Morrow tells Fortune. Morrow has been making the arguments for months, warning that a “tsunami of depreciation” could quietly flatten Big Tech’s AI profits. Behind the trillion-dollar boom in chips, data centers, and model training, he argues, lies a simple but powerful illusion: companies have quietly changed the length of time they account for their machines—and their semiconductor chips—wearing out and depreciating. “Companies are very aware of it,” Morrow claims. “They’ve gone to great lengths to change their accounting and depreciation schedules to get ahead of it—to effectively avoid all this capex hitting their income statements.” Burry’s post drew viral attention. Morrow’s been making the case longer, but he thinks the sudden resonance means investors are finally waking up to something fundamental. “These aren’t small numbers—they’re huge. And the fact that someone like Burry is calling it out tells you people are starting to notice what’s happening between the lines of the balance sheet.” The great depreciation stretch Here’s how depreciation works—or doesn’t. When tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Oracle build AI data centers, they buy tens of billions of dollars in GPUs, servers, and cooling systems. Normally, those assets lose value fast, cutting into profits. But recently, Burry claims, many companies quietly extended how long they claim those machines last—from roughly three years to as many as six. That simple change lets them spread out their costs and report fatter earnings now. “Had they not made those changes,” Morrow says, “their earnings would be dramatically lower.” Meta’s filings, for one, seem to at least corroborate the directionality of Burry’s and Morrow’s claim. Until 2024, servers and network gear were depreciated over four to five years; effective January 2025, Meta said they would “extend the estimated useful lives” of “certain servers and network assets” to 5.5 years. “Depreciation expense on property and equipment,” Meta wrote in its annual filing for 2022, was “$8.50 billion, $7.56 billion, and $6.39 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.” In other words: depreciation was a major cost already, and management clearly chose to stretch the timeline over which those costs are recognized. The policy change doesn’t prove Burry’s dollar totals across firms, but it markedly moves reported earnings in the direction he describes by lowering near-term depreciation expense and pushing more of it into later years. Morrow argues that the timing makes little sense. As the pace of technological change accelerates—Nvidia now releases new chips every 12 to 18 months instead of every two years—the hardware becomes obsolete faster, not slower. It’s like any old technology. Take laptops: imagine trying to run the newest version of Adobe Premiere Pro on a 2018 MacBook. Sure, it might boot up, but it’s going to overheat, lag, or crash, because it simply wasn’t built for today’s compute demands. Old chips are the same way: they don’t stop working, but they quickly lose their economic value as newer, faster models render them functionally obsolete, Morrow argues. To be sure, Morrow’s expertise is in value investing and high dividend companies, as opposed to the trendier, high-growth tech stocks: in fact, he said he has no long positions in technology broadly. So, he benefits if Big Tech multiples compress or if the markets begin to reprice the costs buried in AI spending. Still, his critique aligns with growing unease from other analysts. Richard Jarc, an analyst at Uncovered Alpha, has raised similar alarms about the mismatch between AI chip lifecycles and corporate accounting. He has said that the latest generation of GPUs wears out far faster than companies’ amortization schedules suggest. While some point to the continued use of Nvidia’s H100 chips—released three years ago—as evidence of longer utility, Jarc says that’s misleading. Demand remains high largely because a handful of companies are subsidizing compute costs for end users, a dynamic that depends on investor cash flow rather than fundamentals, Jarc argues. More importantly, Nvidia has now shifted from releasing new chips every 18–24 months to an annual cadence. In that context, Jarc said, treating GPUs as if they’ll remain valuable for five or six years is unrealistic: their true economic life, he estimates, is closer to one or two. The Economist in Sept. called the delayed depreciation “the $4 trillion accounting puzzle at the heart of the AI cloud,” noting that Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle have each extended the useful life of their servers even as Nvidia shortens its chip cycle to one year. By The Economist’s estimates, if those assets were depreciated over three years instead of the longer timelines companies now assume, annual pre-tax profits would fall by $26 billion, roughly an 8% hit. A two-year schedule would double that loss, and if depreciation truly matched Nvidia’s pace, the implied market value hit could reach $4 trillion. Not everyone buys the doom loop. In a note to clients sent this week, Bank of America’s semiconductor team argued that the market’s sudden skepticism about AI capex is evidence that the trade is far less overcrowded than credits claim. The recent selloff in megacap AI names, the team led by Vivek Arya wrote, was driven by “correctable macro factors”—shutdown jitters, weak jobs data, tariff confusion, even misinterpreted OpenAI comments—rather than any real deterioration in AI demand. In fact, the firm pointed to surging ancillary segments like memory and optical (up 14% last week), as well as Nvidia’s disclosure of $500 billion-plus in 2025–26 data-center orders, as signs the underlying spending cycle remains “robust.” Growth or just capital intensity? But Morrow is most worried that investors are mistaking raw spending for real growth. The market, he argues, have stopped distinguishing between capital intensity and genuine productivity. The AI boom has pushed valuations from the realm of software multiples into something closer to industrial-scale infrastructure math. Building just one hyperscale, one-gigawatt data center—enough to support a cutting-edge AI model—can run around $50 billion, with the majority devoted to GPUs, followed by the buildings, cooling systems, and power infrastructure. Reality check—“none of these companies has ever managed a $50 billion project before,” he says. “Now they’re trying to do fifty of them at once.” The irony, he adds, is that many of those facilities can’t even run yet. Data centers across Santa Clara and Northern Virginia are sitting idle, waiting for grid hookups that could take years. “Every month a $35 billion stack of GPUs sits without power, that’s a billion dollars of depreciation just burning a hole in the balance sheet,” he says. “So of course they’re panicking — and ordering their own turbines.” He thinks the result will be a massive power glut by the late 2020s: an overbuilt grid, over-leveraged utilities, and ratepayers stuck with the bill. “We’ve seen this movie before—in shale, in fiber, in railroads,” he says. “Every capital-spending boom ends the same way: overcapacity, low returns, and a bailout.” The biggest risk, he says, is that investors have stopped looking at balance sheets entirely. He points to the sheer concentration of today’s market: nearly half of all 401(k) money now effectively tied to six megacaps. “This is the most crowded trade in history,” he says. “When it turns, it’s going to turn fast.”",right
"Algoma Steel to Cut 40% of Staff as Tariffs Crush Sales Canadian steelmaker Algoma Steel Group Inc. will let go of 1,000 employees and close its blast furnace in northern Ontario within months as it seeks to stem losses resulting from US tariffs. Canadian steelmaker Algoma Steel Group Inc. will let go of 1,000 employees and close its blast furnace in northern Ontario within months as it seeks to stem losses resulting from United States tariffs. The company, based in the city of Sault Ste. Marie, is also shuttering its coke-making operation as it plans to transition to making steel solely by electric-arc furnace in early 2026, a year ahead of schedule, Algoma said Monday in an emailed statement. The Trump administration’s 50 per cent tariffs on foreign steel “have fundamentally altered the competitive landscape and sharply limited our ability to access the U.S. market,” spokesperson Laura Devoni said in the statement. Algoma’s stock fell 6.4 per cent at 3 p.m. in New York. Algoma’s sales dropped 13 per cent in the third quarter and it reported a direct tariff expense of $89.7 million in that period, saying the U.S. steel market had become “largely closed to us.” The company, which currently has about 2,500 employees, was given $500 million in emergency loans from the governments of Canada and Ontario. The layoffs come into effect on March 23. “This transition is necessary to protect Algoma’s future in the face of these extraordinary and external market forces, and we will continue to advocate for a competitive and fair trading environment for Canadian steel,” Algoma said. Industry Minister Melanie Joly said Monday in Parliament that the government will continue working with the Algoma employees affected by the “unjustified and unjustifiable tariffs imposed by the White House” and vowed support for the steelmaker as it develops new products and accesses new markets.

"Steel: 50%. Copper: 50%. Cars: up to 25%. But an even bigger Trump-era levy looms: 107 % on Italian pasta. Mamma mia. It started with the U.S. Commerce Department launching what it says was a routine antidumping review, based on allegations Italian pasta makers sold product into the US at below-market prices and undercut local competitors. That has led to a threat of 92% duties, which would come on top of the 15% tariff President Donald Trump’s administration imposed on European exports generally. The news sent shockwaves through Italy, where 13 producers would be subject to the whopping one-two punch. They say sales in their second biggest export market would shrivel if prices to American consumers more than double. And while the measure would hardly prompt pasta shortages, it still has perplexed importers like Sal Auriemma, whose shop in Philadelphia’s Italian market, Claudio Specialty Food, has been operating for over 60 years. “Pasta is a pretty small sector to pick on. I mean, there’s a lot bigger things to pick on,” said Auriemma, pointing to luxury items as an alternative. But pasta? “It’s basic food,” he said. “Something’s got to be sacred.” Pasta adds heft to Italy’s economy Italy is a nation of avid pasta eaters. Less known is that most of the tortellini, spaghetti and rigatoni its factories churn out gets sent abroad. The U.S. accounts for about 15% of its €4 billion ($4.65 billion) in exports, making it Italy’s largest market after Germany, data from farmers’ association Coldiretti show. The punitive pasta premium has become a cause célèbre for Italy’s politicians, executives and economists. Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida told lawmakers in mid-October that the government was working with the European Commission and engaging in diplomatic efforts, while supporting the companies’ legal actions to oppose U.S. sanctions. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic addressed reporters in Rome last month, stressing the lack of evidence backing the U.S. decision and calling the combined 107% levy “unacceptable.” Margherita Mastromauro, president of the pasta makers sector of Unione Italiana Food, told The Associated Press that prices for Italian pasta in the U.S. remain high, and certainly higher than American-made rivals — undermining any dumping claim. She said that the measures could deal a fatal blow to small- and medium-sized producers. Lucio Miranda, president of consultancy group Export USA, agreed. “A duty rate of 107% would definitely kill this flow of export,” Miranda, who is Italian, said by phone from New York. “It’s not going to be something that you can just dump on the consumer and move on, life continues. It will definitely be a deal killer.” Wacky Mac owner cries foul The Commerce Department’s investigation started in 2024 after complaints from Missouri-based 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, which owns pasta brand Ronzoni, and Illinois-based Winland Foods, whose multiple brands include Prince, Mueller’s and Wacky Mac. The office’s review focused on La Molisana and Garofalo, chosen as primary respondents because they are Italy’s two largest exporters, the Commerce Department said in an emailed statement. Any sale price below either producers’ costs or the price they charge in the Italian market would be considered dumping, in line with numerous other reviews of Italian pasta since 1996, it said. The two companies presented information incorrectly or withheld it, significantly impeding analysis, according to the Commerce Department. And in the face of these alleged deficiencies, the office presented its 92% duty estimate, which it extended to 11 other companies based on an assumption the two companies’ behavior was representative. “After they screwed up their initial responses, the Commerce Department explained to them what the problems were and asked them to fix those problems; they didn’t,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in an emailed response to the AP’s questions. “And then Commerce communicated the requirements again, and they didn’t answer for a third time.” La Molisana declined to comment when contacted by the AP. Garofalo didn’t respond to a request for comment. The sanctions would be applied not just to imports going forward, but also the 12 months through June 2024, according to the Commerce Department. It added that only 16% of total Italian pasta imports may be affected. Its final decision is scheduled for Jan. 2, which could be extended by 60 days. ‘Completely senseless’ A little over an hour’s drive northeast from Naples is Benevento, a sleepy hilltop town of 55,000 people famed for its ancient Roman theater and Aglianico red wine. It’s also home to Pasta Rummo, founded in 1846, which prides itself on its seven-phase, “slow work” production method. CEO Cosimo Rummo is outraged by the threat to his company’s annual 20 million euros in exports to the U.S. “These tariffs are completely senseless,” Rummo said in a phone interview. “These are fast-moving consumer goods … Who would ever buy a pack of pasta that costs 10 dollars, the same price as a bottle of wine?” He added that he has no intention to start producing pasta stateside, as some companies have done and so would be spared the prospective levy. That includes Barilla, which for decades has been the main Italian pasta brand in the U.S. and now has large-scale production facilities there. An unsavory prospect When the transatlantic imbroglio started simmering, Robert Tramonte of Arlington, Virginia sought assurances. The owner of The Italian Store called his supplier, who told him there’s enough pasta inventory stocked in the warehouse to keep prices steady until Easter. Tramonte’s clients count on him for top-shelf product and he was relieved that, at least for the time being, they won’t have to shell out for the real deal. Or worse — perish the thought! — purchase made-in-America pasta. “They’ve tried to make Italian products and use the same ingredients, but the source wasn’t Italy,” he said. “And they just didn’t taste the same.”",right
"Posthaste: Cracks are appearing around the edges of Canada's credit world Delinquencies are rising at the nation's medium-sized banks, says Morningstar DBRS Canadians have come out of the pandemic borrowing binge remarkably well, weathering a steep climb in interest rates, an unsteady economy and rising unemployment. Though the Bank of Canada has reduced its rate to 2.25 per cent, it still remains higher than it has been for the past 15 years, outside of the pandemic. Nor has the wave of mortgage renewals off pandemic lows yet reached its peak. CIBC Capital Markets expects that in the second half of next year the share of borrowers facing payment shocks of more than 40 per cent will hit 5 to 6 per cent of the mortgage portfolio, more than double the share in 2025. Yet so far there has been no signs of trouble in insolvency rates, which have stabilized at levels seen before the pandemic. It’s at the margins of the credit world that observers are beginning to notice the strain. In a report this month Morningstar DBRS warned that mortgage delinquencies are rising at Canada’s medium-sized banks. These smaller banks, which offer an alternative to borrowers unable to get a loan at one of Canada’s Big Six, held $67.6 billion in residential mortgages as of June, 2025. DBRS said still high interest rates and rising unemployment have contributed to the credit deterioration and tariff uncertainty has amplified those pressures, particularly in Ontario and British Columbia, where housing prices have fallen the most. Of the rated mid-sized banks, Fairstone Bank of Canada and subsidiary Home Trust Company, and Equitable Bank are showing the most strain, while Laurentian Bank of Canada has shown resiliency, said DBRS. According to their calculations, Fairstone’s mortgage impairment ratio hit 2.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2025, up from 0.3 per cent at the end of 2022 and Equitable’s rose to 1.1 per cent from 0.2 per cent. “Heading into 2026, we anticipate credit pressures to continue as mortgage rates are still high and tariff uncertainty persists, affecting overall market sentiment,” said DBRS. - Here's how Canada's pension system ranks against the rest of the world's - Why economists are cutting their forecasts for the Canadian dollar - Advertisement 1Story continues below Another report looking at the quality of Canadian household credit by CIBC deputy-chief economist Benjamin Tal also warns of pressures building at the margins. Early-stage delinquencies in below-prime mortgages are now well above pre-COVID levels, and there are signs that homeowners are struggling with non-mortgage debt such as credit cards and lines of credit. “This does not bode well for the mortgage portfolio, mainly in the second half of 2026 when we expect the impact of mortgage refinancing payment shocks to be much more visible, said Tal. The 90+ day delinquency rate of borrowers with no mortgage debt has also been rising and is now 0.2 per cent higher than before COVID. “Given where we are in the economic cycle, we doubt that that rate will start trending downward any time soon. In fact, the opposite is the case,” said Tal. Tal expects delinquency rates to rise in coming quarters, but further credit losses should be contained by unemployment hitting a peak and lenders taking pre-emptive action. Morningstar DBRS also said despite increased impairments, actual loan losses have remained manageable. “In our view, generally good underwriting practices, low uninsured LTVs (loan-to-value ratios), and adequate reserve levels provide a sufficient cushion in this challenging environment,” the report said.

Canada’s economy shrank in August, missing expectations, but an estimate of 0.1 per cent growth in September should keep us out of recession. With the second quarter in the red, contraction in the third would qualify as a technical recession. But now it looks like the economy, though weakened by U.S. tariffs, should eke out some gains. Though the August gross domestic product figures were disappointing, they are not likely enough to press the Bank of Canada back into action, say economists. After cutting its rate to 2.25 per cent last week, the central bank said it was probably done if the economy performed as it expected. Statistics Canada said Friday that GDP is on track to grow by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter.

"New Delhi: The commerce ministry has already started the work to frame detailed guidelines for the Rs 25,060 crore Export Promotion Mission (EPM) and it will start releasing them from this month, a top official said on Monday. The government on November 12 approved the EPM with an outlay of Rs 25,060 crore for six financial years, beginning 2025-26, a move which will help exporters deal with high tariffs imposed by the US. The mission will be implemented through two sub-schemes -- Niryat Protsahan (Rs 10,401 crore) and Niryat Disha (Rs 14,659 crore). ""On export promotion mission, we are already working on these. Many sub-committees are in place which are looking at the detailed guidelines of each of these components. ""We will start releasing them within this month itself. If not all, we will have major portion of these guidelines coming out by the end of this month,"" Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal told reporters here. Under the mission, priority support will be extended to sectors impacted by recent global tariff escalations, such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, and marine products. These sectors are facing challenges in the US market. Due to the high import duties, India's merchandise exports to the US declined 8.58 per cent to USD 6.3 billion in October. The US has imposed a hefty 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods from August 27. Meanwhile, the two countries are negotiating a bilateral trade agreement. Through this mission, the secretary said that the government is trying to address all aspects of trade finance for exporters. The commerce ministry has said that the mission marks a strategic shift from multiple fragmented schemes to a single, outcome-based, and adaptive mechanism that can respond swiftly to global trade challenges and evolving exporter needs. Under Niryat Protsahan, it said, focus will be given to improve access to affordable trade finance for MSMEs through a range of instruments such as interest subvention, export factoring, collateral guarantees, credit cards for e-commerce exporters, and credit enhancement support for diversification into new markets. Similarly, under Niryat Disha, the funds will be used for non-financial enablers such as assistance for international branding, packaging, and participation in trade fairs, export warehousing and logistics, inland transport reimbursements, and trade intelligence and capacity-building initiatives. It is expected to facilitate access to affordable trade finance for MSMEs, enhance export readiness through compliance and certification support, and improve market access and visibility for Indian products.

"President Trump’s recent proposal to pay Americans “at least $2,000 a person” from new tariff revenue—a policy he calls “tariff dividends”—is facing sharp criticism from a budget watchdog, who calculates that the plan will actually lose twice as much money for the country as the tariffs are generating. Writing in a weekend post on Truth Social, Trump argued that tariff revenues could be redistributed directly to individuals in the form of annual payments, with “high income people” excluded from the payouts. The idea, pitched as a way both to reward taxpayers and possibly reduce the national debt, bears a strong resemblance to the structure of the COVID-era Economic Impact Payments, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). But the numbers reveal a steep fiscal challenge. The CRFB estimates that distributing just a single round of $2,000 payments to Americans—calculated to match the COVID payments, which included both adults and children—would cost the federal government around $600 billion per year. By contrast, the tariffs that Trump has championed have raised about $100 billion to date and, even accounting for pending legal cases, are only projected to raise about $300 billion annually going forward. Deficits could skyrocket “If tariff dividends are paid annually, deficits would increase by $6 trillion over ten years,” the CRFB writes, “roughly twice as much as President Trump’s tariffs are estimated to raise over the same time period.” This means not only that the revenue from tariffs would fail to cover dividend payouts, but also that the policy would exacerbate America’s long-term fiscal challenges. To put the numbers in perspective, if dividends were paid out on a “revenue neutral” basis—matching payouts to actual tariff revenue—the analysis estimates that payments could be made only every other year, starting in early 2027. Should the Supreme Court uphold current lower court rulings that have deemed some of Trump’s tariffs illegal, remaining tariffs would only cover the dividend payments once every seven years. Debt implications Beyond blowing past the revenue generated, diverting all tariff proceeds to pay these dividends would restrict the government’s ability to use tariff income for reducing deficits or paying down debt, as some administration officials have proposed. The CRFB warns that using all tariff revenue for rebates would push federal debt to 127% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2035, compared to 120% under current law. If $2,000 dividends were paid annually, that figure could jump further, reaching 134% of GDP over the same period. Such projections come at a time when annual budget deficits are nearing $2 trillion and national debt is quickly approaching an all-time high, making fiscal discipline a top concern for watchdogs and policy analysts. Trump’s proposal draws inspiration from pandemic-era Economic Impact Payments (EIPs), but those measures were carefully income-tested to phase out payments for individuals earning over $75,000 and joint filers over $150,000. The CRFB said its analysis used similar eligibility parameters for its cost estimate, suggesting that without strict limits, the fiscal hit could be even higher.

"Reversals of fortune are nothing new for Bitcoin diehards — euphoric rallies, then brutal selloffs. They happen every few years, or whenever sentiment snaps. None of those previous episodes, though, have prepared traders for the speed and scale of the past few weeks, in a reversal that was sharper than expected even if it lacked the systemic stress of prior crashes. Friday’s drop sent Bitcoin to a low near $80,500, putting it on track for its worst month since Terra’s $60 billion collapse in 2022 set off the bankruptcies that ended in FTX. Altogether, some half a trillion dollars in Bitcoin value has been wiped out. And that’s before tallying the carnage across the altcoin complex. Bitcoin is still comfortably up since President Donald Trump’s November victory, but much of the heady run has vanished in his first year back in office, the very stretch he hailed as crypto’s golden age. Most of the losses remain on paper. But for the first time since exchange-traded funds helped bring Wall Street and retail into the market, those positions are under pressure. The spark this time around is harder to spot. These new ETFs didn’t exist during the last big crypto crash. Investors have pulled billions from the 12 Bitcoin-linked funds this month, Bloomberg data show, with past buyers including Harvard’s endowment and several hedge funds. The slew of digital-asset treasury companies — publicly traded crypto holding vehicles, inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. — have seen even steeper outflows as investors question the value of corporate shells built solely to hold tokens. What’s clear is that crypto has become much bigger than the retail traders and techno futurists who are committed to HODLing through thick and thin. Now it has become woven into the fabric of Wall Street and the broader public markets, bringing a whole new set of finicky players to the table. “What’s happened these last two months was like rocket fuel, as if people were expecting this to crash,” said Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at Copper Technologies Ltd. “That’s what institutional investors do. They’re not there to hold, they don’t have that mentality. They rebalance their portfolio.” Bitcoin remains up roughly 50% from its pre-election low. And the scale of this pullback still pales next to its 75% collapse during the 2021–2022 bear market. That hints at how much deeper the pain could still go. Back then, each leg down exposed another major player — from Celsius to BlockFi to Three Arrows. Flash Crash But with no obvious blowups or scandals this time, some traders think the current drop is more about technicals and confidence than systemic cracks. “We aren’t following the same path down; overall macro conditions, government support, and fewer bad actors in the space make today’s market more resilient,” said Luke Youngblood, founder of lending platform Moonwell. “The foundations crypto is building on are stronger, even if there are causes for concern down the line.” The clearest catalyst was a flash crash on Oct. 10 in which $19 billion of crypto bets were liquidated in a matter of hours. The event exposed the chronic lack of liquidity during weekend trading — the flipside to crypto’s famed 24-7 trading schedule — as well as a build-up of excessive leverage on certain exchanges, knocking Bitcoin from the all-time high of $126,251 that it had reached just days earlier. “To some extent, we believe a lot of the decline in crypto markets is due to what happened on 10/10,” Brett Knoblauch and Gareth Gacetta, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., wrote in a Thursday note. “It feels as if some big players in the space are being forced to sell, as what happened on 10/10 might have had a far-larger impact on balance sheets than initially thought.” The problem hasn’t quite died out yet either. Liquidity in crypto markets remains low, with market makers weakened by the crash unable to step in and support prices. Around $1.6 billion in bets were liquidated across exchanges on Friday, according to Coinglass data, as the latest drop hit leveraged traders. Bitcoin’s gold-like mystique — always a big stretch — has faded. Gold has held its ground. Crypto remains a proxy for fast-twitch risk appetite — and it’s reacting faster than the market around it. This week, Bitcoin got caught up in topsy-turvy trading in technology stocks, with the token’s volatility being pointed to as both the cause and effect of equities turmoil. On Thursday, for example, the S&P 500 rose early in the day, bolstered by strong earnings from Nvidia Corp., before suffering its biggest intraday reversal since the April tariff turmoil. Analysts at Nomura blamed crypto, among other causes. Bill Ackman floated an unusual link — suggesting Fannie and Freddie holdings were behaving like a crypto proxy. Crypto’s fate is now tied to AI-fueled market optimism. With bubble chatter building, it won’t take much to spook investors into selling. There are also plenty of dangers lurking within the crypto ecosystem. The Saylor copycats have been built on the belief that a public company that does nothing but hold crypto can be worth more than the value of the tokens it holds. The push to repurpose public firms into crypto treasuries has endured to this point in the downturn — echoing the overleveraged lenders of 2022. If confidence cracks, forced selling could follow. Many are already underwater on their token holdings. “When you’ve got a medical device company or a cancer research firm rebranding as a crypto treasury, it’s a sign of where you are in the cycle,” said Adam Morgan McCarthy, senior research analyst at blockchain data firm Kaiko. Overall, any positive vibes left in the industry appear to be hurtling toward rock bottom.

"EXCLUSIVE: While Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman weighs a gubernatorial bid, Gov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., is reportedly considering a corporate tax hike – a move the New York Republican described to Fox News Digital as a ""tax on the middle class."" Blakeman said a decision about his political future is coming ""very soon"" as he travels across New York state to determine if he has the ""support to get to the next level."" But as Blakeman mulls his political future, he is sounding the alarm on Hochul for reportedly planning to raise taxes on corporations to shore up funds for the state's budget gap and to deliver on Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's socialist campaign agenda, according to Politico. ""This is a tax on the middle class,"" Blakeman told Fox News Digital. ""It will make things less affordable. It will drive up inflation, and it will make New York less competitive. Corporations are already leaving our state in record numbers. Jobs are leaving our state. People are leaving our state. This corporate tax increase will drive more high net-worth individuals and corporations out of New York State and will be an economic disaster."" NEW YORK LEADER PLEDGES MORE COPS, TOUGHER ICE PARTNERSHIP IF NYC ELECTS SOCIALIST MAYOR Kyle Strober, executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, the region's leading economic development advocacy organization, told Fox News Digital that a corporate tax increase could be ""potentially devastating"" to Long Island's economy. STEFANIK DECRIES HOCHUL AS 'WORST GOVERNOR IN AMERICA' IN FIERY 2026 CAMPAIGN LAUNCH ""Long Island, whose economy is closely aligned with New York City, is already confronting multiple challenges, including high taxes, high costs of living, and a lack of housing driving potential employees and employers outside the region,"" Strober said, adding that a corporate tax hike would ""only serve to drive away additional businesses and high-income earners, who pay the majority of the state’s tax revenue."" ""When this occurs, the tax burden is shifted to Long Island’s hard working middle class. It becomes self-evident that this tax proposal would fly in direct conflict of making New York more affordable for our middle class, a stated goal of Albany leadership,"" he explained. The ABLI led efforts in 2021 and 2025 to oppose tax hike proposals out of Albany, particularly tax hikes on the top 1% of New Yorkers and raising the corporate tax rate. Hochul has faced pressure from the socialist wing of the Democratic Party to raise taxes so Mamdani can deliver on his ambitious campaign promises, including fast and free buses, universal childcare and city-run grocery stores. Mamdani campaigned on raising taxes on the top 1% of New Yorkers and hiking up the state's corporate tax from 7.25% to 11.5% to match the rate in New Jersey. Any tax hikes would require Hochul's approval in Albany. MAMDANI LAUGHS OFF CRITICISM THAT HIS TAX HIKE PROPOSALS WILL COMPEL NEW YORKERS TO FLEE While the comparably moderate governor endorsed Mamdani after he secured the Democratic nomination, Hochul has maintained that she won't raise taxes on the top 1% of New Yorkers – despite Mamdani's supporters heckling Hochul to ""Tax the rich!"" ""This has become a one-party state ruled by the far-left, woke, progressive part of the Democratic Party, now led by Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City, who is an avowed social democrat,"" Blakeman said, charging that Mamdani sounds like a ""communist."" ""He is anti-American values,"" Blakeman said. ""He is against business. He will destroy the economy of the greatest financial city in the world, the financial capital of the world: New York City. And that will have a material effect on my county, which borders New York City."" Blakeman said Hochul raising taxes on corporations would be a ""disaster."" And when asked how the state should approach Mamdani following his election night success, Blakeman said Republican leadership needs to step up and ""push back"" in New York state. ""When he wants to do crazy things, like give free bus rides to everybody, which will be nothing more than homeless shelters on wheels, when he doesn't want to prosecute criminals for committing crimes, when he wants to increase taxes and increase the corporate tax rate, and he wants the tax the rich, which will drive people out of New York State, and they'll take jobs with them, we have to push back."" While New York City handed power to its far-left flank on Election Day, neighboring Nassau County re-elected Blakeman, an ally of President Donald Trump. ""I won because I adhered to American values, American principles. I didn't raise taxes a penny in four years. I hired 600 new law enforcement professionals. I declared Nassau County wasn't a sanctuary county. I showed leadership and I reached out to communities that in the past, the Republican Party has ignored,"" Blakeman said, explaining how he built a broad coalition of support among diverse communities. When reached for comment, Hochul campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika told Fox News Digital that the governor has ""cut middle class taxes while putting inflation refund checks in New Yorkers’ pockets."" ""Bruce Blakeman is the number one fanboy for Trump’s tariffs that are raising costs for families and making everything more expensive for small businesses – while the governor remains laser-focused on lowering costs, Blakeman’s shilling for Donald Trump’s tariff tax hikes,"" Chitika charged. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Since winning his re-election earlier this month, Blakeman said business and political leaders have encouraged him to launch a campaign for governor, given his executive experience. But while rumors swirl about Blakeman's political future, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., another Trump loyalist, has already launched her gubernatorial campaign and secured support from New York Republican Party Chair Ed Cox and 36 New York conservative county chairs.",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format There has been longstanding confusion about how a $2,000 “tariff dividend” would be delivered to American families. Any such large cash payout would need approval from Congress, and some Republicans have already opposed the idea. ALSO READ: US citizens to receive IRS stimulus checks in November 2025 and $2,000 tariff dividend checks? Check the latest update Stimulus checks for Americans soon? So far, tariffs imposed under Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) have brought in only about $90 billion through September 23, according to the US Customs and Border Protection. That amount is far below what a national stimulus check program would require.For comparison, a COVID-era plan to send $2,000 checks to families was estimated to cost $464 billion. Even limiting the payments to households earning under $100,000 would still cost about $300 billion, according to Erica York of the Tax Foundation. There are also concerns that if the Supreme Court rules against Trump’s use of IEEPA tariffs, the government might have to return some money to importers. Overall, the U.S. collected about $195.9 billion in tariffs during fiscal year 2025 through August 31. Bessent said the administration “inherited this affordability disaster” and the worst inflation in decades. He added that no final decision has been made on the structure of Trump’s stimulus proposal. Instead of direct checks, the “dividend” could be delivered as tax relief targeted at Americans earning under $100,000. ALSO READ: Jeffrey Epstein’s chilling email before suicide mentioned Trump? Here's what the disgraced financer wrote Economists warn that the federal budget may not be able to support cash payments. York estimates the new tariffs could raise nearly $217 billion by 2026 — still far short of the roughly $300 billion needed to provide $2,000 payments to the 123 million households earning below $100,000. Is there enough tariff revenue? The White House's proposal to use tariff revenues to fund a $2,000 dividend check for millions of low- and middle-income Americans has become the focus of economic and political debate. Although the measure has undeniable appeal to voters frustrated by the cost of living, economists and financial analysts warn that the logic behind this initiative is flawed, especially with regard to its financing and potential inflationary impact.Donald Trump's controversial proposal suggests a payment of at least $2,000 for most US citizens, funded by revenue generated from his tariff policies. The proposal must go through an approval process, but even before that, many experts say that it has no support or economic backing, as there is no budget to finance this proposal. ALSO READ: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS puzzles scientists again: Cosmic visitor's survival behind the Sun points to possible alien origin? Check details The biggest challenge to the proposal is basic math. Analysts estimate that sending $2,000 to about 150 million lower-income adults would cost roughly $300 billion. Customs revenue has grown — reaching nearly $195 billion in the last fiscal year — but the money raised from the new tariffs is far smaller, at around $120 billion so far. Economists say this makes it highly unlikely that the promised $2,000 checks could be paid for using tariff revenue alone.

"Starmer Girds for Six-Month Fight to Save His Premiership Keir Starmer has six months to prove his mettle to his party amid swirling doubts within the governing Labour Party that he can reverse plunging public confidence in his UK administration. (Bloomberg) — Keir Starmer has six months to prove his mettle to his party amid swirling doubts within the governing Labour Party that he can reverse plunging public confidence in his UK administration. The prime minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves survived a budget statement this week that did just about enough to avoid a reckoning with the markets and Labour Members of Parliament. But with voters turning their backs on Labour, at some point his party will decide whether to stick with him, or twist. Ministers and aides told Bloomberg that Starmer needs to convince his lawmakers and the public before local elections in May that “Starmerism” can be a vote winner. Speaking anonymously about party ructions, some close to the premier fear a move against him in the new year, before one potential challenger, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, has an opportunity to return to Parliament. What’s clear is Starmer can ill-afford his approach to continue to be what internal critics say is an incoherent mess, as typified by a chaotic run-up to the budget. As the year draws to a close, Labour MPs are asking themselves whether Starmer can stop the rot. Pollsters are doubtful. “It’s very unlikely, if history is anything to go by, that Starmer, Reeves and the government as it stands will be able to turn this around,” YouGov’s head of political data, Patrick English, told Bloomberg Radio on Friday. “The majority of voters will get the chance to vote in May and at the minute, as far as we can tell, they’re preparing to give the government a right good kicking.” Certainly the budget didn’t seem to please voters, with many left feeling forgotten. Polling in the aftermath suggest the British public has completely lost confidence in the Starmer-Reeves project. The Labour government which swept to power in a landslide election win just 16 months ago has so far pursued an awkward mash of competing ideas. There were big election promises to prioritize growth and investment that suggested Starmer might be the heir to former premier Tony Blair. He’s also poured a lot of energy into international affairs, with a focus on security and the war in Ukraine. This year, his government has toughened its messaging around migration and crime: an approach espoused by Starmer’s top aide, Morgan McSweeney, aimed at stopping the working class falling to populism. There’s also been some more typically Labour re-distributive social democracy, with taxes on the rich and higher public spending, as well as increased welfare spending forced in part on the government by rebellious Labour backbenchers who rejected attempts to curb spending on disability benefits and winter fuel payments to pensioners. Many inside Labour have asked which is the real Starmer. Some posited that Reeves’ budget, broadly seen as a tilt to the left, may be a sign of a permanent political shift from Downing Street to shore up his position. They may be disappointed. Those close to the premier say don’t expect him to pick a side. Starmer’s allies said bridging different ideas is the key to success for a progressive leader in a world dominated by President Donald Trump, and in a country with huge structural economic problems. Any leader who doesn’t push on all these fronts will fail, one argued. That approach featuring a long list of U-turns frustrates many within the party, who see it as lacking vision or direction. The run-up to the budget — including a retreat from plans to raise income tax — was described by government officials as hellish and shambolic, and compounded the sense ministers aren’t fully in control of the narrative. Reeves’ package itself left Blairites and some of those previously allied to McSweeney less enthused about a budget without a growth plan. That’s not without risk as Health Secretary Wes Streeting emerges as a leadership contender on Starmer’s right flank. It looks like the pre-election pitch to back growth and business is out of the window, though there will be a fresh push in these areas in the coming weeks, a government official said. Only a few weeks back, it was Burnham and the so-called soft-left sharpening their knives calling for a government with more Labour values. They won’t go away, especially if the May elections are brutal and Reeves comes after the welfare budget again. One Starmer ally said he isn’t lurching between different factions, he’s trying to work with them all. Another sought to highlight Starmer’s successes on the international scene, saying it was no small achievement to have helped hold Trump back from the brink of siding with Russian President Vladimir Putin in seeking a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. Nevertheless, Starmer’s inner circle knows things haven’t gone well domestically, and are seeking more robust arguments for what he is trying to do. The premier will make an unashamedly Labour case that paying more tax is worth it for better public services, an aide said. Starmer said on Thursday that the budget had “asked everybody to make a contribution” to protect public services and help people struggling with the cost of living. “I’m not going to apologize for lifting half a million children out of poverty,” he said. The premier also knows it is essential to reform welfare, spark more dynamism in the UK economy, and stop small boats crossing asylum-seekers across the English Channel. His problem is, each time the government pulls in any of these directions, it upsets a Labour faction. No. 10 aides despaired at the perennial criticism, asking who Starmer’s detractors think could do a better job at handling Trump and British populist leader Nigel Farage. Changing leader for either Streeting, Burnham or former deputy premier Angela Rayner would destroy Labour’s mandate and deliver Farage to power, they argued. The officials said there’s still time to turn things around before the next general election, due in mid-2029. But they also fretted that governing is becoming impossible in an age of hyper-cynicism, a total lack of patience and instability caused by international events such as the Ukraine conflict and Trump’s tariff war. Starmer’s inner circle still hopes that in 2026 the prime minister the country and party wants is the decent pragmatist who takes different ideas and tries to make the best of a bad hand. Their fear is that both Labour MPs and voters want something else. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion. Please keep comments relevant and respectful.

"Chicago Boycotts America While the Fed Gets Cooked by San Francisco and Pasta Welcome back to Friday! This is the Breitbart Business Digest weekly wrap, where we review the economic news of the past seven days while sipping on the delicious cocktail of economic vindication mixed with institutional humiliation. The Federal Reserve released research proving its own rate-holding decision was based on a theoretical mistake. Italian pasta makers are confirming that tariffs work through demand destruction, not price inflation. The government shutdown destroyed economic data we might have used to validate or debunk the Fed’s forecast. The Supreme Court is about to reshape central bank independence. And a Chicago politician is using taxpayers’ retirement funds as a campaign billboard while boycotting the safest investment on Earth. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference on September 18, 2024, in Washington, DC. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)I Left My Broken Economic Theory in San Francisco It’s been quite a week for people who believe the Federal Reserve should actually read its own research before making trillion-dollar decisions that affect everyone’s mortgage payments. Jerome Powell, the nation’s central banker, has spent the better part of 2025 explaining why the Fed couldn’t cut interest rates because—and we quote him directly from June—tariffs would “show up more” as “tariff inflation.” Researchers at the San Francisco Fed released a paper this month examining tariff policy from 1870 through 2020 across the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Their conclusion: when countries raise tariffs, inflation actually falls, not rises. A roughly four percentage point increase in average tariffs lowered inflation by about two percentage points while raising unemployment. This isn’t a close call. The pattern held across different time periods—before 1913, the interwar period, post-WWII. Higher tariffs correlated with lower prices and weaker economic activity. Not upward price pressure. Downward. Powell’s entire rationale for holding rates steady—protecting us fragile Americans against tariff-driven inflation—was built on what the Fed’s own research now shows was a foundational misunderstanding. Oopsies! Proof in the Pasta Aisle You want evidence that tariffs don’t raise consumer prices? Look at Italian pasta. Italian pasta makers are facing combined tariffs of 107 percent—92 percent from Commerce Department antidumping duties and 15 percent from Trump’s EU tariff. Rather than raise prices on boxes of rigatoni, they’re preparing to exit the U.S. market entirely. Giuseppe Ferro, CEO of La Molisana, put it bluntly: “No one has those kinds of margins.” In other words, the tariffs cannot be passed on to consumers, and even the importers are not absorbing them. The foreign producers are being forced to mangia the tariffs. By the way, do not blame Trump if your favorite pasta vanishes from the shelves. The huge tariffs the Italians are facing are not Trump’s EU tariff but anti-dumping tariffs imposed by an independent probe. In other words, they would have been applied by any administration. No Data Collection, No Data Reports As everyone knows, the government shutdown lasted six weeks and was the longest in history. Importantly, it lasted through the collection periods for October’s consumer price index and jobs reports. This wasn’t just a delay in releasing data that was already collected. The shutdown prevented the data from being collected at all. The Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys asking households about employment and spending during specific time windows. Apparently, they can’t retroactively ask someone in November about their labor market participation in October. The moment passes. The data vanishes like the Golden Gate Bridge on a foggy day. So, now we’re in the surreal position of having a Fed chair whose entire rate-holding decision was premised on tariff inflation fears—fears that the Fed’s own research just demolished—while missing the very economic data that might have validated or invalidated his forecast. October CPI might never exist. The October jobs report might vanish into the bureaucratic void. The Fed is, as Karoline Leavitt said, “flying blind at a critical period.” Which means Powell made a major monetary policy error based on faulty theory, and we might never get the actual data that would have shown it to him in time. Let Them Cook The Supreme Court this week scheduled arguments for January 21 on whether President Trump can remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Cook has been hanging on since late August, when Trump indicated he wanted her gone over mortgage fraud allegations that she denies. The Court scheduled the case for the last possible date of the January sitting, apparently feeling no sense of urgency about this battle that the media has frequently insisted is an existential crisis for the central bank. There may be more here than meets the eye. In December, the Supreme Court will hear a case that could overturn the 1935 Humphrey’s Executor ruling, which shields agency heads from at-will removal. If SCOTUS overturns that precedent (and recent cases suggest they’re inclined to), Cook’s removal becomes legally straightforward. So, the court may have scheduled Cook’s day in court to follow the death of Humphrey’s Executor. Chicago’s Treasurer Announces She’ll Boycott America Melissa Conyears-Ervin, Chicago’s treasurer, announced Wednesday that she’s ordering her office to boycott investing in U.S. Treasury securities — not as an investment strategy, but as a political protest against Donald Trump and what she called his “authoritarian regime.” This is the municipal finance version of an insurrection. Conyears-Ervin obviously hates Trump, which she is entitled to. But Trump doesn’t issue any Treasuries. Those are the debt of the U.S. government, backed by the full faith and credit of the American people. She’s not boycotting authoritarianism. She’s boycotting America. Here’s the thing: Chicago doesn’t currently hold any Treasury securities. The city held over $200 million in Treasuries within the past three years, but not now. So, she’s announcing a boycott of something the city isn’t doing. What is Chicago going to invest in if they will not buy America’s debt because their treasurer is mad at the man America elected president? Conyears-Ervin claims her office can safely earn comparable returns in alternatives like corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. In other words, to protest Trump’s misdeeds, she’s going long corporate America. American leftism is getting weirder and weirder. Oh, and guess what? She’s running for Congress. Because of course she is. The Founding Father of South America This Sunday, November 16, marks the 493rd anniversary of Spanish explorer Francisco Pizarro‘s encounter with the Inca Empire at Cajamarca—one of history’s most consequential collisions between civilizations. This triggered the Spanish colonization of most of South America, which in turn gave birth to the modern nation-states that exist today: Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Pizarro, in other words, is the founding father of South America. It’s the kind of historical milestone that used to warrant reflection on how the world changes, how power redistributes, how established orders crumble. These days, it’s the kind of anniversary polite society has decided not to celebrate. Have a good weekend. COMMENTS Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",right
"Listen to this article in summarized format Trump’s $2,000 Tariff-Funded Checks Spark Economic Debate Trump announced the idea on Truth Social, saying every eligible American would receive a “dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!)” funded by tariff revenues, as per a Newsweek report. The plan, however, has not been formally introduced as policy, and many questions remain about how it would work and whether it’s financially viable.Economists Warn Trump’s $2,000 Payments Could Fuel Inflation Several experts told Newsweek that Trump’s plan could push prices higher, as Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said, “Sending out checks to Americans is a recipe for higher inflation at a time when inflation is still stubbornly too high,” adding, “The president is pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, while he is also now pushing for higher spending—those two policies in combination would seriously threaten a return of higher inflation,” as quoted by Newsweek.ALSO READ: Big Short Michael Burry warns: Meta and Oracle may be hiding billions and fudging earnings by over 20% Economists Compare Trump’s Plan to Pandemic-Era Stimulus Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff agreed, saying the $2,000 payments would “of course” drive inflation up, similar to the effects of pandemic-era stimulus checks, as per the report. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed that such fiscal stimulus during COVID-19 increased annual inflation by about 2.6%, though it also helped avoid deeper economic trouble, reported Newsweek.Lessons From the 2021 American Rescue Plan on Inflation Risks Maurice Obstfeld, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said “The experience of the American Rescue Plan in 2021 shows that such rebates would be inflationary,” adding, “Already under pressure from higher prices of necessities, most households would spend rather than save the money, driving prices even higher,"" as quoted in the report.ALSO READ: Nvidia now worth more than Japan’s entire economy — just 30,000 employees vs 124 million people Can Tariff Revenues Really Fund Trump’s $2,000 Rebate Checks? Experts Doubt It Economists also questioned whether tariffs alone could pay for such large payments. The Treasury Department reported that customs duties brought in about $195 billion in the 2025 fiscal year, reported Newsweek.Obstfeld estimated that “Even if the $2,000 checks are awarded per household (not per person), and only to households earning less than $100,000 per year, the budgetary cost would be more than $200 billion,"" as quoted in the report. He added, “This sum is close to the revenue Trump’s tariffs will probably yield this year, and more than half of the cost of extending the Obamacare subsidies for 10 years,” and said, “The checks would contribute materially to a U.S. federal deficit that is already unsustainably large,” as quoted by Newsweek. FAQs What is Donald Trump’s $2,000 check proposal?It’s a plan to send $2,000 payments to lower- and middle-income Americans using money raised from tariffs. Who would qualify for Trump’s $2,000 checks? Trump said the payments would go to lower- and middle-income Americans, excluding high-income earners.

"American shoppers are expected to spend more during this holiday shopping season than last year despite economic uncertainty and rising prices. The 2025 forecast from the National Retail Federation on Thursday estimates that shoppers will collectively spend between $1.01 trillion and $1.02 trillion in November and December, an increase of 3.7% to 4.2% compared with last year. Retailers rung up $976 billion in holiday sales last year, the group said. “We’re seeing really positive behavior and engagement from consumers, ” NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay told reporters on a call Thursday. “In fairness, that’s been somewhat of a surprise.” But Shay said more Americans are growing selective and they’re focused on discounts. And while spending is expected to be up again, the growth of that spending may be in decline. That is still greater than the average increase of 3.6% between 2010 to 2019. Americans ramped up spending after that during the coronavirus pandemic. Holiday season sales rose 8.9% in 2020 and soared 12.5% in 2021, according to the NRF. The group’s holiday forecast is based on economic modeling using various key economic indicators including consumer spending, disposable personal income, employment, wages, inflation and previous monthly retail sales releases. NRF’s calculation excludes automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants to focus on core retail. Holiday spending accounts for 19% of annual sales for the retail industry, though for some retailers the number is a lot higher, according to the NRF. And consumer spending in the U.S. is monitored closely because it drives about 70% of the nation’s gross domestic product. The forecast this year, however, arrives during the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. There has been no government data released on the jobs market or retail sales since the shutdown began 37 days ago. “Forecasting is increasingly challenging in this environment,” Shay acknowledged. The NRF forecast is in line with other estimates, however, which point to slowing growth. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase last year. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31, compared with last year’s 4.2%. Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion this holiday season, representing 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year’s 8.7% growth. Consumer spending in the U.S. has remained resilient even as consumer confidence has eroded. Mark Matthews, NRF’s chief economist and executive director of research, said consumer behavior is changing with a sharper focus on finding deals. And the frequency of family nights out at a restaurant is on the decline, NRF executives said. The timing of the government shutdown is “absolutely problematic,” Matthews said, noting that it’s led to a loss in private sector income, which erodes consumer demand. Spending should recover once the shutdown ends, Matthews said, yet there are broader issues of concern that will not be solved when the government shutdown ends. The gap between wealthy and lower-income households is widening, according to analysts. Based on spending from its credit card and bank customers, Bank of America found that spending growth among lower income households rose 0.6% in September compared with the same period last year. Among higher income brackets, spending rose at more than four times that speed, or 2.6%, in September. And wages are growing faster for higher income households. That is making it more difficult for lower income households to keep up when tariffs and other economic factors are pushing prices higher. In a separate report this week, Bank of America estimated that U.S. consumers are bearing 50% to 70% of the U.S. tariff costs, and it expects that load to grow. “We think there is overwhelming evidence that tariffs have pushed inflation higher for consumers,’’ Bank of America economists Stephen Juneau and Aditya Bhave wrote. At the same time, U.S. companies have announced tens of thousands of job cuts. Some companies have cited rising operational costs from new tariffs under the Trump administration, as well as shifting consumer spending, corporate restructuring, or increased spending on artificial intelligence. That has led retailers to pull back on the hiring of seasonal workers.",right
"U.S. officials are privately saying that they might not levy long-promised semiconductor tariffs soon, potentially delaying a centerpiece of President Donald Trump's economic agenda. Officials relayed these messages over the last several days to stakeholders in government and private industry, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations. A fourth person following the matter also said the administration was taking a more cautious approach to avoid provoking China. The discussions have not been previously reported. Trump aides are taking their time on chip tariffs as they work to avoid a rupture with Beijing over trade issues, which would risk a return to a tit-for-tat trade war and disruption of the flow of critical rare earth minerals, according to two of the people. Those people cautioned that no decision is final until the administration signs off on it, and also said that triple-digit tariffs could be imposed at any time. The sources spoke anonymously in order to recount private conversations about policy deliberations. Trump said in August that the United States would impose a tariff of about 100% on imports of semiconductors but exempted companies that are manufacturing in the U.S. or have committed to do so. Privately, over the last several months, Washington officials had told people that the administration would roll out the tariffs soon. That guidance has now changed as the administration has continued to debate the timing and other details. A White House spokesman and a Commerce Department official, asked about the discussions, disputed that the administration had adjusted its posture. ""The Trump Administration remains committed to using every lever of executive power to reshore the manufacturing that's critical to our national and economic security,"" said the spokesman, Kush Desai. ""Any anonymously-sourced reports suggesting otherwise are simply Fake News."" The Commerce official said, ""There is no change in department policy regarding semiconductor 232 tariffs."" Neither specified how soon tariffs that have been threatened since the early days of the Trump administration would be finalized, nor did they offer any other details. The Chinese embassy in Washington said cooperation between the two countries on semiconductors is the best approach. ""We welcome the U.S. to work with China to implement the consensus reached at the Busan summit between the two heads of state, create a favorable environment for mutually beneficial cooperation between companies from both sides, and jointly maintain the stability of the global semiconductor supply chain,"" said the spokesperson, Liu Pengyu. TRUMP FACES PRESSURE ON CONSUMER PRICES Any decision by the administration to slow down or narrow the scope of chip tariffs would come at a sensitive time for Trump. The Republican president is facing growing consumer angst over prices heading into the holiday shopping season. Hiking taxes on imported semiconductors could raise consumer costs on the gadgets they power, from refrigerators to smartphones. Reuters reported in September that the Trump administration was looking at a plan that would also tax foreign electronic devices based on the number of chips in each one. Trump rolled back tariffs on more than 200 food products last week, but he has also said that his import taxes have made no significant contribution to inflation. The U.S. government shutdown has delayed recent data on consumer prices, but inflation has been running above the Federal Reserve's target since former President Joe Biden held office. Trump is also trying to maintain a delicate trade truce with China, a top manufacturer of both semiconductors and devices powered by them. Last month, Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, and reached an agreement to set aside their trade issues, for now. During those conversations in Korea, U.S. officials nonetheless warned their Chinese counterparts that they could take national security steps in the coming months that Beijing might find objectionable, according to two people familiar with those conversations. Trump has bet that tariffs can revive domestic factory jobs lost over decades to countries including China. In April, the Trump administration announced investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat. Officials relayed these messages over the last several days to stakeholders in government and private industry, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations. A fourth person following the matter also said the administration was taking a more cautious approach to avoid provoking China. The discussions have not been previously reported. Trump aides are taking their time on chip tariffs as they work to avoid a rupture with Beijing over trade issues, which would risk a return to a tit-for-tat trade war and disruption of the flow of critical rare earth minerals, according to two of the people. Those people cautioned that no decision is final until the administration signs off on it, and also said that triple-digit tariffs could be imposed at any time. The sources spoke anonymously in order to recount private conversations about policy deliberations. Trump said in August that the United States would impose a tariff of about 100% on imports of semiconductors but exempted companies that are manufacturing in the U.S. or have committed to do so. Privately, over the last several months, Washington officials had told people that the administration would roll out the tariffs soon. That guidance has now changed as the administration has continued to debate the timing and other details. A White House spokesman and a Commerce Department official, asked about the discussions, disputed that the administration had adjusted its posture. ""The Trump Administration remains committed to using every lever of executive power to reshore the manufacturing that's critical to our national and economic security,"" said the spokesman, Kush Desai. ""Any anonymously-sourced reports suggesting otherwise are simply Fake News."" The Commerce official said, ""There is no change in department policy regarding semiconductor 232 tariffs."" Neither specified how soon tariffs that have been threatened since the early days of the Trump administration would be finalized, nor did they offer any other details. The Chinese embassy in Washington said cooperation between the two countries on semiconductors is the best approach. ""We welcome the U.S. to work with China to implement the consensus reached at the Busan summit between the two heads of state, create a favorable environment for mutually beneficial cooperation between companies from both sides, and jointly maintain the stability of the global semiconductor supply chain,"" said the spokesperson, Liu Pengyu. TRUMP FACES PRESSURE ON CONSUMER PRICES Any decision by the administration to slow down or narrow the scope of chip tariffs would come at a sensitive time for Trump. The Republican president is facing growing consumer angst over prices heading into the holiday shopping season. Hiking taxes on imported semiconductors could raise consumer costs on the gadgets they power, from refrigerators to smartphones. Reuters reported in September that the Trump administration was looking at a plan that would also tax foreign electronic devices based on the number of chips in each one. Trump rolled back tariffs on more than 200 food products last week, but he has also said that his import taxes have made no significant contribution to inflation. The U.S. government shutdown has delayed recent data on consumer prices, but inflation has been running above the Federal Reserve's target since former President Joe Biden held office.

"Costco Wholesale Corp. joined a fast-growing list of businesses suing the Trump administration to ensure eligibility for refunds if the US Supreme Court strikes down the president’s signature global tariffs policy. The nation’s biggest warehouse club chain is among dozens of companies to file lawsuits in a US trade court since late October challenging President Donald Trump’s use of an economic emergency powers law to impose the levies, according to court records. It’s one of the biggest corporate players to jump into a fight largely driven this year by small businesses and Democratic state officials. The Supreme Court heard arguments on Trump’s tariffs on Nov. 5. The justices put the fight on a fast-tracked schedule but didn’t say when they intend to rule. In the meantime, businesses of all sizes have brought cases pressing similar legal claims with the goal of avoiding uncertainty about their eligibility for refunds if the court rules against Trump. Read More: Tariff-Paying Firms Line Up in Court to Get Paid If Trump Loses Costco’s lawyers wrote that the complaint, filed on Nov. 28 in the US Court of International Trade, was prompted due to the uncertainty that refunds will be guaranteed for all businesses that have been paying duties if the Supreme Court declares the tariffs unlawful. The lawsuit doesn’t specify how much Trump’s tariffs have cost the company to date. Costco argues that it needs a court intervention immediately because Customs and Border Protection denied its request to extend the schedule for finalizing tariff determinations under Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The company says that could jeopardize its ability to seek full refunds in the future. Costco didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that, “The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump’s lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court’s speedy and proper resolution of this matter.” Skeptical Justices During arguments before the Supreme Court last month, key justices appeared skeptical of Trump’s tariffs, which have generated tens of billions of dollars a month. Lower federal courts ruled against the administration in a handful of lawsuits filed early on, but judges have allowed the government to enforce the tariffs until the Supreme Court issues its decision. Other household names to bring tariff lawsuits in recent weeks include cosmetics giant Revlon Consumer Products Corp. and motorcycle maker Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing Corp. The expansive, fast-changing tariff policies have disrupted the retail sector this year, threatening to raise prices of goods and hamper the purchasing power of US consumers who are already cautious following years of inflation. The impact has been more muted than expected due to exemptions and changes in rates after negotiations, though some items such as electronics and apparel are more expensive compared to a year ago. While retailers have warned that they continue to see higher costs, many big operators have not pursued lawsuits like Costco — making it an outlier. Read More: What’s at Stake as Trump’s Tariffs Face Supreme Court Costco has said it’s working to mitigate tariffs, which primarily affect its non-food items. It has rerouted some products to non-US markets, ordered more inventory early to get ahead of the levies and purchased from fewer suppliers by consolidating buying. When items get too expensive, it’s changing merchandising altogether. “We’re doing everything we can,” Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said in an interview with Bloomberg News earlier this year. “Whether that’s working with the suppliers to find efficiencies to offset the impact of tariffs, or whether it’s sourcing with them often to different countries.” For example, Costco said in May that it kept steady prices of pineapples and bananas imported from Central and South America because they are important items to customers. At the same time, it increased prices of flowers sourced from the region because they are less of a necessity to shoppers. The club chain said its big size and limited assortment — its stores carry a couple thousand items versus over 100,000 for some big-box retailers — give it a leg-up when navigating tariffs. Still, it’s difficult to predict what will happen to prices, company executives said. The case is Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Customs and Border Protection, 1:25-cv-316, US Court of International Trade.",right
"Good morning. Just three years ago, most companies treated generative AI like an uncertain curiosity. Today, it’s hard to find a Fortune 500 company that isn’t rethinking core processes to leverage it—momentum that’s only accelerating as 2026 approaches. Leaders are no longer debating whether generative AI will matter; they are racing to determine how to operationalize it. That shift was the topic of my conversation with Wharton marketing professor Stefano Puntoni, co-director of the Wharton Human-AI Research (WHAIR) initiative. Puntoni noted that generative AI adoption is progressing at an eye-opening pace. “I don’t think there’s any company that now says, ‘Generative AI isn’t for us,’” he said. The third annual WHAIR study, conducted with GBK Collective, underscores this acceleration, Puntoni told me. A survey of 800 senior leaders in finance, IT, HR, and other functions at U.S. companies with more than $50 million in annual revenue found that 88% expect to increase generative AI investment in the next year, and 62% expect budgets to rise by more than 10% within two to five years. This marks a sharp reversal from 2023, when concerns around data leakage, regulatory liability, and consumer protection—especially in heavily regulated industries—led many companies to ban generative AI outright, Puntoni explained. Today, most enterprises are moving ahead and figuring out optimal implementation with guardrails, he said. “I think it’s going to take a decade to really find out how to use this technology, but it’s improving so rapidly,” he added. Usage patterns show the shift. In 2023, only 37% of senior leaders used generative AI weekly. Now, 82% do, and 46% report daily use, according to the report. Because generative AI is a general-purpose technology, Puntoni and his colleagues expect usage to reach near-universal levels. “Half of senior leaders in a large sample of corporate America are saying that they’re using a tool every day; that is really quite incredible,” he said. Measuring progress Leaders appear optimistic about returns. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said their companies track ROI through metrics such as profitability, productivity, and throughput, according to the report. Four out of five expect positive returns within two to three years, with top executives more optimistic than mid-level managers. Still, progress varies by company size. Larger enterprises are seeing slower results as they manage complex integrations, while midsized and smaller firms report quicker progress. Tech, banking, and professional services firms are among the sectors making strides. The ROI reports rely on self-assessments rather than hard evidence, Puntoni said. Many organizations are still refining how they measure success, often focusing on intermediate metrics. “We should look at this data as more like a vibe of how they feel about it than hard evidence for what’s happening inside these companies,” he added. MIT’s August report found that, based on its dataset, most firms struggle to generate immediate ROI from generative AI—from a profitability perspective—with back-office automation delivering the biggest impact. However, both the MIT and WHAIR reports highlight a persistent barrier: workforce skill gaps. Wharton’s survey shows that 43% of leaders warn of “skill atrophy,” underscoring the need for better AI training programs. As generative AI matures in the enterprise, organizational readiness is paramount—leadership alignment, workforce skills, governance, and change management, not just technical capacity, according to the report. Enterprise AI is already a major focus on Wall Street, and investors are watching closely as big tech companies and their customers scale adoption. As we head into 2026, a clearer question is emerging: not whether generative AI will create value, but how companies can build the skills, systems, and governance to capture it.

"USTR Greer Talks Trade With Swiss as Swatch CEO Blasts Approach US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer held a video call with top Swiss officials following this week’s diplomatic mission to the White House from captains of Swiss industry, as the country looks to negotiate a reduction in the punishing 39% tariff the US has imposed on Switzerland. (Bloomberg) — US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer held a video call with top Swiss officials following this week’s diplomatic mission to the White House from captains of Swiss industry, as the country looks to negotiate a reduction in the punishing 39% tariff the US has imposed on Switzerland. Greer held the virtual meeting with his Swiss counterpart Helene Budliger Artieda and economy Minister Guy Parmelin, according to a Linkedin post by the Swiss government late on Friday. “Very constructive conversation with Ambassador Jamieson Greer on Trade and Investment,” the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs said in the post. “Great new dynamic in our bilateral relations, thanks to President Trump.” It features screenshots and photos of all three in discussion, and is followed by dozens of likes and messages of encouragement from Swiss executives. The virtual gathering follows the in-person meeting in the Oval Office earlier this week between the CEOs of top Swiss companies and President Donald Trump. Those present included Alfred Gantner, the founder of Partners Group Holding AG, Rolex SA boss Jean-Frederic Dufour, Daniel Jaeggi of commodity trader Mercuria Energy Group Ltd, Richemont SA Chairman Johann Rupert, Diego Aponte of shipping firm MSC and Marwan Shakarchi of MKS Pamp SA, a gold refiner. While Dufour and Rupert are both influential figures in the luxury goods industry, their rival Nick Hayek, the outspoken CEO of Swatch Group AG took a very different tack. “The only king I court is the customer,” Hayek told Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, perhaps in reference to the recent ‘No Kings’ protests against Trump’s presidency. Hayek, whose company is the world’s largest watchmaker, said the CEOs’ visit sent a signal of weakness. Instead, he suggested that Switzerland — the seventh-largest investor in the US — should retaliate by threatening to cut investment, or ditch a deal to buy US-made F-35 jets. “Are we William Tell,” he quipped in reference to the Swiss hero of folklore, “or are we a vassal?” Trump’s tariff announcement, delivered on Switzerland’s national holiday, landed Swiss exporters with a rate higher than any other developed nation. The levy, which took effect in August, threatens to drive up costs for chocolatiers including Lindt, watchmakers and precision-tool manufacturers. Budliger Artieda has made repeated trips to Washington in recent weeks in the hope of resolving the impasse. While demand for Swiss goods has, in some cases, withstood the impact of the tariffs, Bern has cut its growth forecast for next year, acknowledging the likelihood of economic damage.

"Trump administration says it has trade frameworks with Argentina, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said Thursday that it had reached trade frameworks with Argentina, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala. The frameworks are about increasing the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, according to a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity as a condition for briefing reporters on a call about the agreements. The White House also released statements on the frameworks, which have yet to be finalized and are expected to be signed within roughly two weeks. It’s all part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump to rewrite the rules of global commerce through the use of broad tariffs. President Javier Milei of Argentina hailed his country’s first bilateral trade framework with the U.S. in nearly a decade as “tremendous news.” “As you can see, we are strongly committed to making Argentina great again,” he said. The frameworks touch on an array of subjects, including efforts to reduce nontariff barriers and cut tariffs to 0% on American-made goods as well as commitments to not impose digital services taxes on U.S. companies. There would also be tariff relief on select products from these countries. For example, import licenses in these countries would be eliminated and streamlined, while nations would agree to resolve issues on intellectual property rights. Under the tariffs previously announced at the end of July by Trump, goods imported from Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemala are taxed at 10%, as the U.S. runs a trade surplus with each of those countries. Products from Ecuador, with which America runs a trade deficit, are taxed at 15%. Guatemala President Bernardo Arevalo called the framework “good news” and said his country would be in a position to attract new investments. He said that 70% of the products Guatemala exports to the U.S. will face zero tariffs under the framework, as exclusions are granted for goods the U.S. is unable to make. All other goods would still be subject to the 10% tariff. The U.S. senior administration official said that tariffs in these nations could be reduced on coffee, cocoa and bananas. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump have each suggested that the tariffs are being relaxed as affordability issues are a key concern for U.S. voters. ___ Perez D. reported from Guatemala City, Guatemala.

"US, South Korea Eye Joint Pact to Build Submarines for Both The US and South Korea are in private negotiations to jointly build nuclear-powered submarines for both navies, a potential major shift in their alliance that would go beyond the announcement made by the countries’ presidents two weeks ago, people familiar with the matter say. (Bloomberg) — The US and South Korea are in private negotiations to jointly build nuclear-powered submarines for both navies, a potential major shift in their alliance that would go beyond the announcement made by the countries’ presidents two weeks ago, people familiar with the matter say. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met in South Korea in late October and announced a pact to enable South Korea to build its own nuclear-powered submarines, with Trump saying they’d be built in Philadelphia. Since then, behind the scenes, a more sprawling vision has taken shape, the people said. A joint fact sheet on their overall trade, tariff and defense agreement published Thursday evening in Washington, and Friday morning in Seoul, touched on the building of nuclear submarines but gave no further details, an indication that many points remain unresolved. Officials from both countries are now considering a plan for Korean-led joint production, potentially across sites in both countries, of subs for both countries, according to the people. The scenario includes potentially beginning with US-class submarines, the designs for which are closely held secrets, before moving to South Korea’s own design, the people said. The talks stem in part from a private request of Trump’s own: When Korea sought the relevant permissions and nuclear capability to build its own subs, Trump privately said they should build a couple for the US, too, some of the people said. The US has been trying to speed up its submarine building. What form the deal will take remains deeply unclear, and talks could stall or collapse. The two sides are in early-stage negotiation over several core components, such as which subs will be built, where they’ll be built, for which country and in what sequence, the people said. In the fact sheet, the two sides celebrated joint efforts that “will increase the number of U.S. commercial ships and combat-ready U.S. military vessels as quickly as possible, including the potential construction of U.S. vessels in the ROK,” or Republic of Korea. It added: “The United States has given approval for the ROK to build nuclear-powered attack submarines. The United States will work closely with the ROK to advance requirements for this shipbuilding project, including avenues to source fuel.” The statement made no mention of Philadelphia. The statement stopped well short of detailing talks already underway. Any agreement between the US and South Korea would reshape the nations’ military alliance and could be similar to the Aukus deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. But the proposal is unprecedented in other ways, and would face significant questions, hurdles and headwinds to come to fruition. For the US president, the deal with Seoul is part of a grand bargain to lower certain tariff rates on Korean goods in exchange for a $350 billion investment fund that includes $150 billion in shipbuilding. Trump is angling to leverage Korean expertise in shipbuilding to revive the US sectors, from submarines to more mundane commercial vessels. “Having South Korea build submarines for the US Navy — based on a US or Korean design — would be unprecedented and carry significant risk,” said Adam Farrar, a Bloomberg Economics senior geoeconomics analyst for the Asia-Pacific. “Yet with US shipyards falling short of Navy needs, tapping allied shipbuilding expertise could help, if the towering legal, industrial and security hurdles can be cleared.” Earlier: US Races to Rebuild Submarine Power Before China Catches Up During a televised briefing on the fact sheet, Lee said Korea had continued to stand its ground in talks to finalize the overall trade and tariff pact since the Trump visit. “The US government maintained that the general framework had already been settled during the summit. But when it came to drafting the detailed text, they presented a wide range of differing opinions,” Lee said. “The lengthy process was unavoidable — it was the only way we could fully exercise the one power we had, which was to hold firm.” Still, the joint statement leaves several questions about the submarine plan swirling as talks continue. The Philly Shipyard, which is owned by Korean defense giant Hanwha, is not currently equipped to make nuclear-class submarines, though the company is preparing to build subs under any deal and has an internal target of producing 2-3 submarines within a decade, including potentially in Philadelphia, some of the people said. “Hanwha Philly Shipyard was a centerpiece yard in America’s storied naval shipbuilding past, and our commitment to it will chart the way toward America’s advanced shipbuilding future,” Hanwha Chief Strategy Officer Alex Wong said in a statement that did not directly touch on the US-South Korea talks. Trump is continuing to push for the US to receive two submarines and believes they should be provided for free, according to one of the people. Given that submarines can cost several billion dollars, it would be a steep ask. In a written statement on Thursday, Lee’s presidential office said that characterizing South Korea as pushing back against US demands or that the US had asked for two submarines for free was not a reflection of the state of discussions. South Korea has long sought nuclear-powered submarines and during his meeting with Trump, Lee asked Trump to provide fuel for them. South Korea says it needs low-enriched uranium — below 20% enrichment — from the US but, for that, the two nations would need to amend or find a way to reconcile their nuclear energy pact, which prohibits Seoul from using such fuel for military use. While Trump’s October announcement appeared to provide a green light for South Korea’s goal to possess nuclear submarines, Seoul wants to build them at home — and is seeking the technology to do so. The US is also looking to increase its own fleet, with construction of its foremost attack submarine, the Virginia-class, beset by cost overruns, delays, and labor shortages. The White House has declined to specify what class of submarine it wants built — leaving open the scenario that it might pressure the Koreans to build US-class subs like the Virginia class, at least in part, rather than their own design. But that goes against South Korea’s initial wishes for a smaller design. And the potential of that raises its own set of questions and potential controversies, including whether Virginia-class subs would be partially built in South Korea. The joint statement’s reference to “potential construction of U.S. vessels in the ROK” nodded to the possibility, though didn’t explicitly specify military vessels. “Even though Trump supposedly approved it, that doesn’t mean it will actually happen overnight,” said Kim Dong-yup, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies and retired South Korean Navy officer. “These things take years, even a decade to accomplish and there are countless legal and policy constraints in the US, including non-proliferation and secrecy restrictions. If Trump leaves office, it’s entirely possible that US agencies will step in and block the whole thing.” The White House declined comment other than to say in a statement, from spokeswoman Anna Kelly, that Trump is bolstering US maritime power “including by securing historic investments from the Republic of Korea to modernize and expand our shipbuilding capacity.” —With assistance from Alastair Gale.

"India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) on Tuesday raised India's GDP growth projection for the current fiscal to 7 per cent on the back of high growth in the June quarter and less impact of the US tariff hike on global growth and trade. Ind-Ra expects GDP in FY26 to grow 7 per cent year-on-year (YoY), 70 basis points higher than its earlier forecast of 6.3 per cent (projected in July 2025), the rating agency said in a statement. The RBI has projected India's GDP growth in the current fiscal year at 6.8 per cent, better than the 6.5 per cent expansion in the last fiscal year. India's real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at the fastest pace in five quarters at 7.8 per cent in the April to June period of FY26. The official data for Q2 (July-September) GDP growth estimates is scheduled to be released on November 28. Ind-Ra said both domestic and global landscapes have changed significantly since its last forecast in July 2025. Major headwinds are the uncertain global scenario due to the US unilateral tariff hikes for all countries, with the tariffs on India being one of the highest since the end of August 2025. The major tailwinds for the economy since the July forecast are faster-than-expected inflation decline, increasing the real wage rate, especially in rural areas and GST rationalisation, said Ind-Ra Chief Economist and Head Public Finance, Devendra Kumar Pant. The two major factors for the sharp upward revision in growth forecast are sharper-than-expected GDP growth in the June quarter and the impact of the US tariff hike on global growth and trade being lower than the estimated earlier. Ind-Ra, while forecasting the FY26 growth at 6.3 per cent in July, had assigned a key risk of tariff war and any capital outflow. Ind-Ra believes the risks to FY26 growth are evenly balanced. ""A faster Indo-US trade deal and favourable weather conditions during winter months have the potential to push GDP growth higher than 7 per cent. However, if the demand revival (consumption and investment) is weaker than expected, it could pull down GDP growth,"" the agency said. Ind-Ra expects private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) to grow 7.4 per cent YoY in FY26 (FY25: 7.2 per cent), driven by GST rationalisation and lower inflation. Ind-Ra said Indian exports to the US fell 11.9 per cent and 8.9 per cent YoY in September and October 2025, respectively. While exports averaged USD 7.2 billion per month in FY25, they averaged USD 7.4 billion from April to October 2025, but dropped to USD 5.9 billion during September-October 2025. ""Although exports to the US improved sequentially in October 2025, it is too early to call it a revival. A bilateral trade deal with the US and finding alternative markets for Indian exports would be essential for reviving Indian exports,"" Ind-Ra said.

A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone” ""We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place,"" Trump posted. In another post, Trump said, “So, let’s get this straight??? The President of the United States is allowed (and fully approved by Congress!) to stop ALL TRADE with a Foreign Country (Which is far more onerous than a Tariff!), and LICENSE a Foreign Country, but is not allowed to put a simple Tariff on a Foreign Country, even for purposes of NATIONAL SECURITY.” He continued, “That is NOT what our great Founders had in mind! The whole thing is ridiculous! Other Countries can Tariff us, but we can’t Tariff them??? It is their DREAM!!! Businesses are pouring into the USA ONLY BECAUSE OF TARIFFS. HAS THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT NOT BEEN TOLD THIS??? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON???President DJT.” ALSO READ: Millions of US citizens to receive stimulus payment before Thanksgiving 2025: Check amount, date, eligibility and more $2000 tariff dividend check in November? While President Trump announced that every citizen excluding high-income Americans should get a $2000 tariff dividend check, it is unlikely this will come in November. He has just announced his intention on Truth Social and for this to become law, there must be a Bill which is passed in the House of Representatives and Senate. Notably, there is a government shutdown ongoing as well.Trump for the first time specified $2,000 as the proposed “tariff dividend.” Earlier, he had suggested that Americans might receive between $1,000 and $2,000. The administration has not yet explained how it plans to distribute the payments. The proposal resembles stimulus checks — direct government payments meant to boost spending during an economic slowdown. While many details remain unclear, Trump’s post on Truth Social confirmed that high-income earners would not be eligible.

"The deal also includes a commitment by Swiss and Liechtenstein companies to invest $200 billion in the US, with $67 billion slated for 2026 alone, aiming to create thousands of American jobs and reduce the US trade deficit with Switzerland. The agreement, announced by US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer and Swiss officials, reflects the successful culmination of constructive negotiations to promote “Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade."" ALSO READ: Trump plots major tariff cuts to slash soaring grocery bills for millions of Americans Ambassador Greer highlighted the deal as a continuation of the ""America First Trade Policy"" that removes tariff and non-tariff barriers, expands market access for U.S. exports, and welcomes sizable Swiss investment into the US economy. Key features of the agreement include: - Reduction of US tariffs on Swiss and Liechtenstein goods to a maximum of 15%, aligning them with rates applied to the European Union, down from 39%, which had severely impacted Swiss exports. - Switzerland's commitment to removing tariffs on American industrial goods, while also opening up new duty-free quota systems for specific U.S. agricultural products such as beef, poultry, and bison. - Measures to simplify customs and labeling processes, making it easier for American goods like poultry, dairy, and medical devices to enter Swiss markets. - Robust agreements on intellectual property rights, digital trade principles including the avoidance of harmful digital services taxes, and enhanced cooperation on export controls, sanctions, and investment screening. - Swiss plans to invest $200 billion in the U.S. by 2028, with substantial new investments focused on pharmaceuticals, aerospace, and other key sectors. The US trade deficit with Switzerland and Liechtenstein stood at $38.3 billion in 2024, and this agreement is expected to pave the way for levelling that deficit by 2028 by fostering more balanced, reciprocal trade ties. This trade deal ends months of tariff tensions that began when the Trump administration imposed the 39% tariffs in 2025 as part of a broader strategy to address trade imbalances and alleged unfair trade practices by key partners. The agreement is seen as a mutually beneficial framework that strengthens economic ties, secures supply chain resilience, and supports job growth on both sides of the Atlantic through expanded market access and substantial new investments.

"U.S. manufacturing surveys released Monday showed welcome signs of easing inflationary pressures, with both major purchasing managers’ indexes reporting slower rates of price increases in October—a potentially encouraging signal for Federal Reserve policymakers as official government economic data remains unavailable due to the ongoing federal shutdown. The price moderation emerged as a rare point of agreement between two surveys that otherwise painted starkly different pictures of the manufacturing sector’s health. Inflation Cooling Despite Tariff Pressures The Institute for Supply Management’s Prices Paid Index fell to 58.0 in October from 61.9 in September, indicating input costs are still rising but at a significantly slower pace. Similarly, S&P Global reported that while input price inflation remained “historically elevated,” October marked the lowest rate since February. Both surveys attributed ongoing cost pressures primarily to tariffs, but the deceleration suggests some relief may be emerging in supply chains. With the federal government shutdown continuing, private sector surveys like the ISM and S&P Global PMI reports have taken on heightened significance for businesses, investors, and policymakers seeking real-time economic intelligence in the absence of official Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and other government data releases. Beyond the inflation picture, however, the two surveys diverged sharply on the overall state of U.S. manufacturing. The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7 from 49.1, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction (readings below 50 indicate declining activity). The index missed economist expectations of 49.3. “In October, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted at a faster rate, with contractions in production and inventories,” said Susan Spence, chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee. Production notably fell back into contraction after a brief improvement in September. Only two of the six largest manufacturing industries—food, beverage and tobacco products, and transportation equipment—expanded during the month. ISM reported that 58 percent of the manufacturing sector’s GDP contracted in October. The S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI registered 52.5, up from 52.0 in September, indicating a third consecutive month of expansion. The survey reported production increasing at a “solid pace” and new orders growing at their fastest rate in 20 months, driven primarily by domestic demand. New export orders declined in both surveys. S&P Global reported exports declined for a fourth consecutive month and to the greatest degree since July, with sales falling to key markets including Canada, China, Europe and Mexico. The survey explicitly attributed the decline to tariffs, stating “tariffs reportedly remained the primary driver behind the drop in exports.” S&P Global’s Chris Williamson noted that “tariff policies being increasingly blamed both on rising export losses and import supply chain disruptions.” Business confidence remained subdued in both surveys. S&P Global reported optimism falling to its lowest level since April, with “US trade policy uncertainties” cited as “a big factor in dampening business spirits.” ISM respondents also described challenges related to trade policy. “Business continues to remain difficult, as customers are canceling and reducing orders due to uncertainty in the global economic environment and regarding the ever-changing tariff landscape,” said one ISM respondent from the chemical products sector. The ISM report noted that tariffs and their impact on prices and demand “feature highly in respondents to the survey.” Both surveys showed weak labor market conditions in manufacturing, with ISM’s employment index at 46.0 (contraction) and S&P Global reporting only “modest” hiring growth for a third successive month. A closer examination of S&P Global’s survey reveals potential concerns beneath its expansion reading. The report documented an unprecedented surge in finished goods inventories—the steepest increase in over 18 years of survey history. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, called this “the most worrying” development in the report, noting it was “widely linked to weaker than anticipated sales to customers, especially in export markets, which could trigger a downshifting of production in the coming months unless demand revives.” Williamson added that “companies have also become less optimistic about the year ahead, with sentiment back down close to the gloomy levels seen around the April tariff announcements.” He noted particular weakness in consumer-focused industries: “Business confidence among producers of consumer goods is now down to its lowest for two years as firms growing increasingly worried about household spending in the US and falling sales to consumers in export markets.” This inventory buildup—where production exceeds sales—often presages future production cuts, potentially explaining why ISM’s data already shows production contracting. The Momentum Question ISM’s Spence noted that while there had been “a chain reaction of one-month index improvements” starting with new orders in August and flowing to production in September, “these short gains have not appeared to translate into sustained growth for the sector, a reflection of continuing economic uncertainty” The ISM data showed that October’s reading “corresponds to a change of plus 1.8 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis,” suggesting the manufacturing sector, while contracting, is not dragging down the broader economy, which requires a PMI reading below 42.3 to indicate overall economic contraction. The sharp divergence between the surveys reflects differences in sampling and methodology. S&P Global surveys approximately 600 manufacturing firms, while ISM polls over 400 companies. The different industry compositions, geographic distributions, and weighting methodologies may explain the conflicting signals. With inflationary pressures moderating but demand uncertainty persisting, manufacturers face a challenging environment navigating trade policy impacts, weakening exports, and economic uncertainty. The restoration of government economic data releases would provide additional clarity, but until then, these private surveys—despite their differences—offer the most timely glimpses into the manufacturing economy’s direction.

"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said New York City just shot itself in the foot by electing avowed democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani its next mayor, adding that the far left would have lost in both the Big Apple and New Jersey if an exodus wasn’t already under way. Fox News host Sean Hannity said at least 9% of New Yorkers plan to leave the city if Mamdani wins, adding that he personally hopes Mamdani loses — for the sake of friends who haven’t yet joined him in Florida after the city’s political decline. DeSantis suggested he will continue to welcome New Yorkers to Florida who want to keep any far-left politics back north. ""This is a guy, Mamdani, he wants to take down the Columbus statue. I have already said if they take that from Manhattan, we will take it in Florida,"" he said, adding he’d also accept the Statue of Liberty if it decided to leave and instead be erected in Lake Okeechobee. CUOMO CALLS NYC MAYORAL RIVAL 'DANGEROUS,' WARNS SOCIALISM WOULD BE 'DEATH KNELL' FOR CITY ""And I think it's an incredible act of ballistic podiatry, shooting yourself in the foot, by New York City voters. This is a guy who does embrace Marxist economics. He claims he's going to lower everyone's costs by having government-run grocery stores, and the only people that would think that would work are people who have never studied a lick of history,"" DeSantis said. Mamdani’s win was also followed by several fervent reactions from critics who noted that the socialist will be at the helm on the 25th anniversary of 9/11 – including Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., who posted a clip of a plane hitting the World Trade Center and writing, ""Wake up New York."" DeSantis said Mamdani appeared to only offer sympathy to an aunt who was on the subway and ""got dirty looks"" after the terror attacks. ""He never expressed the sympathy in that regard for all the people that got murdered. He's always embraced George Soros-style soft-on-crime policies. He hates the NYPD, if you look at his history. He is not going to stand up for law enforcement,"" the governor said. Soros’s son, Alexander, posted a photo captioned that he was proud to be a New Yorker after voting for Mamdani on Tuesday. ""The number one thing that moves people to want to flee these jurisdictions is the collapse of public safety,"" DeSantis added. SOCIALIST SHOCKWAVE: ZOHRAN MAMDANI STUNS NYC AS VOTERS HAND POWER TO DEMOCRATS’ FAR-LEFT FLANK ""And I think he's going to make the [Bill] de Blasio reign look like the Golden Age."" DeSantis noted that New Jersey GOP candidate Jack Ciattarelli came close to defeating Gov. Phil Murphy four years ago — but said countless Republican voters have since left the Garden State for Florida. ""First of all, we're not asking for anyone to move. People have talked about putting a tariff on people moving in at this point, because so many have done so. And I know a lot of people in Florida would think that that would be necessary, but here's just the truth: You look at all 49 other states since I've been governor, look at who's migrated to Florida,"" DeSantis said. FLORIDA MAYOR PREDICTS 'SUBSTANTIAL EXODUS' OF NYC BUSINESSES IF MAMDANI WINS ""[W]hen I got elected, we had 300,000 more registered Democrats in Florida. Today, we have 1.4 million more Republicans. Nobody has ever seen a change that profound."" Fox News Digital reached out to DeSantis’ office as well for further comment on the exodus. DeSantis also commented separately on Virginia voters selecting a man to be their top law enforcement officer who had envisioned the violent murder of a Republican leader and his children: ""That Virginia would elect a guy who wanted to see the children of his political opponents murdered — against a successful Republican incumbent — is a sign that the state is about to move strongly left,"" DeSantis said of Jay Jones’ win over incumbent Jason Miyares. In response to an X follower who asked where DeSantis would house refugees from New York City, the governor quipped: ""Southern Connecticut?"" In remarks Wednesday, Trump echoed DeSantis, saying that Miami will ""soon be the refuge of those fleeing communism in New York City."" Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins separately commented prior to Mamdani’s victory that it is heartbreaking to see what is happening politically in the northeast. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP ""I guess the last thing you can say about that is ‘Don't New York Our Florida’ -- Don't take your doctrine and your indoctrination and bring it down here. We're very free,"" Collins said. ""We stand for freedom and liberty, and we want to keep it that way. So if you're going to come to Florida, you better start espousing how we do things here."" Sharing conservative commentator Benny Johnson's collage of Mamdani calling the NYPD ""Haram"" -- an Islamic Sharia word for sinful or prohibited -- or for the force's defunding, Attorney General James Uthmeier remarked that the left is ""so desperate for a 'W,' they'll cling to Mamdani just to get one."" Mamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens, ran on promises of rent control expansion, climate investment, and city-run groceries. His campaign did not immediately respond to an inquiry on DeSantis’ remarks.",right
"Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch voiced concern Wednesday about granting presidents unlimited authority, pressing lawyers to define limits on executive power as the high court heard arguments over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs. Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, questioned both the “major questions” and “nondelegation” doctrines while asking Solicitor General D. John Sauer to outline boundaries to the administration’s broad defense of its tariff powers. The conservative justice warned of “a one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people’s elected representatives” in Congress. Sauer acknowledged that under the same interpretation, a future president could declare climate change a national emergency and impose tariffs to address it — a scenario that appeared to underscore Gorsuch’s warning about unchecked executive authority. Read more: Uncommon Knowledge: Trump’s Tariffs Showdown at Supreme Court Has a Twist Why It Matters The Court heard oral arguments in two cases related to Trump’s ability to authorize tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) on Wednesday. IEEPA is a 1977 law that allows the president to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.” Trump cites IEEPA in executive orders related to reciprocal tariffs, which he states he has the authority to implement. The Supreme Court currently has a 6-3 conservative majority and has previously ruled in favor of the Trump administration on key issues such as immigration enforcement and cuts at federal government agencies. What To Know Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned Sauer about the limitations of the president’s power. “I want it explained to me how you draw the line, because you say we shouldn’t be concerned because this is foreign affairs and the president has inherent authority, and so delegation off the books, more or less. And if that’s true, what would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce, for that matter, declare war, to the president,” Gorsuch said. Sauer responded, “We don’t contend that he could do that.” Several other justices questioned Sauer's arguments, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett. In a brief, Sauer and other attorneys for the administration had argued that the verbiage of IEEPA is “capacious,” granting the president the authority to control a broad range of transactions. Barrett said to Sauer during oral arguments, “You’ve referred to the other verbs in IEEPA as capacious. Would you really describe them as capacious? Because to me, things like nullify and void have definite meanings. I agree with you that regulate is a broader term, but those words I think are powerful, they give, they pack a punch, but I wouldn’t describe them as capacious in the sense that they have a wide range of meanings.” What People Are Saying Justice Neil Gorsuch, during oral arguments: ""Don't we have a serious retrieval problem here? Because once Congress delegates by a bare majority and the president signs it, and of course, every president would sign a law that gives them more authority, Congress can't take that back without a supermajority. And even, you know, even then it's going to be veto-proof. What president is ever going to give that power back? Pretty rare president."" Solicitor General D. John Sauer, during oral arguments: ""I disagree because in January 2023, Congress voted to terminate one of the biggest IEEPA emergencies ever, the COVID emergency, and the president went along with that. So what the statute reflects is there's going to be the ability for a sort of political consensus against a declared emergency.""

"Tariff Dividend: U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday pledged to distribute a $2000 tariff dividend directly to most American citizens, asserting that the plan will be funded entirely through the nation’s booming tariff revenues. The announcement, made via Trump’s Truth Social account, comes as his trade policies face a critical legal test before the U.S. Supreme Court. In his Sunday morning post, President Trump said the United States is “taking in trillions of dollars” through tariffs and will “soon begin paying down our enormous $37 trillion debt.” He added that a dividend of at least $2000 per person, excluding high-income earners, would be paid directly to Americans. No other information about who will be eligible and when the payments will begin has been disclosed yet. The announcement comes amid heightened legal scrutiny of Trump’s tariff policies. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the scope of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), under which Trump justified his wide-ranging levies on imports from China and other nations. Lower courts have previously ruled that many of the tariffs exceeded executive authority. A final ruling from the nation’s highest court could determine whether the president can continue using tariffs as a unilateral fiscal instrument. Despite the pending review, Trump remains defiant. “People that are against tariffs are fools!” he posted on Truth Social, claiming that the tariffs have strengthened America’s manufacturing base and made the country “the richest, most respected in the world.” According to the Treasury Department, customs duties collected in fiscal year 2025 amounted to $195 billion, as per a report by Business Insider. In an earlier interview with One America News Network, Trump had floated the idea of a $1000–$2000 distribution to citizens, claiming that tariff revenues could generate “over a trillion dollars a year.” Trump Promises Direct Dividend From Tariff Revenues In his Sunday morning post, President Trump said the United States is “taking in trillions of dollars” through tariffs and will “soon begin paying down our enormous $37 trillion debt.” He added that a dividend of at least $2000 per person, excluding high-income earners, would be paid directly to Americans.No other information about who will be eligible and when the payments will begin has been disclosed yet.
